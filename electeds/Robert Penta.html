<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_TWmAoWQ2xQE/2024-06-01_TWmAoWQ2xQE.html">City Council 04-30-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4059.531s">My</a> name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4062.853s">Having</a> served on this board some years ago, the city of Medford and Tufts University engaged in the pilot, a million dollar pilot program. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4070.599s">And</a> the pilot program consisted of six students from Medford, six students from Somerville, who'd be able to go to Tufts University for nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4078.644s">The</a> million dollar cash part of the program consisted of three years of getting cash up front with the remaining portions of the money to be used for <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4087.17s">I</a> think there could have been fire or police equipment here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4091.334s">Now</a> that hasn't been followed through since, for what reason, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4096.54s">But</a> the idea of taxing up to 25% relative to the nonprofit, whether it's Tufts University or someone else, I guess you haven't hit the dollar mark yet of where you're gonna go. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4107.008s">But</a> speaking with leaders up at the State House, the one thing that the City of Medford hasn't done, as other cities and towns done, you have not moved to provide an amendment to the CPA tax, which would include affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4120.793s">And</a> as a result of that, and knowing that the Commonwealth now does not give back to the City of Medford from their surplus to the CPA, it's all going to be on cities and towns, excuse me, individually. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4134.938s">So</a> I think the city of mid that has an opening over and beyond your 25% also to amend the CPA to now include affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4144.467s">You</a> know, you give it to churches, you've given it to schools into swimming pools and open space and land. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4150.333s">This</a> is a great opportunity right now for you as a council, first term especially, to move forward on your reps and on your senators to make this amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4159.44s">You're</a> not getting rid of the CPA, you're amending it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4162.442s">And</a> by amending it to put this inclusion in there, this will be your first step along with your 25% for the purpose of going forward to get your affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4171.489s">The</a> other part of affordable housing is very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4175.672s">What</a> has the city of Medford, can you folks, any one of you here, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4180.322s">give</a> an accounting of how much money has been used for affordable housing, where has the location's been, where is the land, and where has the working relationship taken place between a private contractor coming in with the city of Medford to provide affordable housing along with regular housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4200.675s">I</a> don't think you have a big inventory on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4202.617s">And</a> I think if you keep talking about affordable housing, you keep talking about the transfer tax, you keep talking about the registry, I think you should start there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4211.023s">Because</a> if there's nothing on the books right now, I think you need to get your feet wet in that particular area, get your base set up before you go into this next move. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4220.251s">25%</a> sounds good. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4221.072s">I</a> think you need an inventory of all the property in the city method that's tax exempt. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4225.035s">And</a> I'm quite sure you'll find <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4226.696s">There</a> are other pieces only on Tufts University where you can get that 25% from. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4231.419s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4275.327s">But</a> a few years ago up in Beacon Hill, before the 25% came into play, there was a percentage ratio that went, like I believe Tufts University at the time had a $30 million endowment. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4285.695s">And</a> there was a dollar amount that was set on the endowment that the school had. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4289.878s">as</a> to what percentage it would go. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4291.841s">Now,</a> Tufts doesn't have a large endowment. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4293.663s">It's</a> not like Harvard University that's into the billions of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4297.368s">But</a> there was a dollar amount, you may want to check this out once again, do your homework, go to Beacon Hill and find out what that legislation was. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4304.438s">Unfortunately,</a> it didn't pass because as you said before, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4308.402s">Academy</a> of colleges and universities. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4310.565s">But</a> still, it's a stepping stone to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4313.369s">You</a> know, and these are all pilot programs that you can look into, just because somebody is multi rich, like having I mean, Tufts University, you might find other locations where, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4326.28s">Listen,</a> if you treat one one way, you got to treat them all the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4330.762s">And</a> it might be better to have a universal thing rather than go to the 25% and just go for the biggest one. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4335.604s">Because</a> if you can work on all of them, maybe in the long run, you'll be able to get more in the long run than just grappling at the first one.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4367.516s">But</a> what you don't have right now in your inventory, you might have that, which I can vote, but you don't have the physical ground locations with new and additional affordable housing can go in and working toward that with getting this money, whether it's again, the 25% of the affordable housing of the CPA money, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4386.75s">Understood.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4387.171s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4387.811s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8558.968s">Mr.</a> President, can I speak on that first? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8561.349s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8585.106s">Did</a> you withdraw it?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8875.732s">Mr.</a> Chairman.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9158.611s">Robert</a> Pinto, Zero Summit Road in Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9162.154s">Regarding</a> the public letter that was written on April 16th regarding House Bill, I believe it's 3128, the Affordable Home Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9174.103s">In</a> that particular bill, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9176.141s">There</a> were transfers fees also that could be beneficial to a community that were discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9182.47s">And</a> there was seven inclusions as it related what you could and could not do, which also had an opt-in and an opt-out proviso in that bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9192.364s">But</a> I'd like to, to you, Mr. Chairman, I want to get to your letter of April 28, where you sent out a notice saying, correcting the record on Medved's plans to address the housing crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9204.072s">And</a> two particular paragraphs were sort of like, watch me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9207.054s">The</a> first, the first one states the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9209.736s">The</a> City Council and the City Planning staff are working on zoning rebuild reforms to allow more housing to be built, reduce permitting and regulatory burdens for private property owners, encouraging major economic development, and require construction of more <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9227.916s">subsidize</a> affordable housing units. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9230.358s">We</a> are also working on policies to benefit good landlords like the Good Landlord Tax Credit. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9237.422s">And</a> the second paragraph reads, the final piece of that comprehensive approach <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9243.405s">is</a> anti-disbursement policies targeted at the large corporations who are buying properties, jacking up rents, and earning a huge profit by knocking out long-time residents and making unnaturally affordable units too expensive for the average person. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9262.242s">I</a> understand what you wrote, but I don't understand who these large corporations that are coming in here into the city of Medford and they're dispersing people. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9271.87s">I</a> see houses that are bought by individuals who had an opportunity to buy a single family or two family house as an individual, but not as a corporation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9281.379s">And</a> you sent this out apparently because you wanted to allegedly, you know, correct something that was sent out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9289.502s">But</a> if I were to see this as I did see it, I'm confused right now because I don't know of any major large corporations that have come in to the city of Medford and bought single or two family homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9302.369s">either</a> tore them down, rebuilt them, and sold them for large profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9306.431s">I</a> know individual people have done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9308.653s">But</a> when you say large corporations, it makes it look like this city is now being overrun by large corporations. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9315.516s">And</a> if you're going to address that through your zoning and your community development, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9322.278s">The</a> wording is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9324.6s">And</a> this type of wording makes it look like corporate America has just taken over the city of Medford, making it unaffordable for people to live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9332.525s">And</a> that's not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9333.966s">You</a> also have the opportunity of a business person or a business lady who may be able to come in here, can afford to buy a single or two or a three family house, do it over, and if they can make a profit, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9345.773s">If</a> the city really wants to get into affordable housing and low and moderate income housing, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9351.457s">They've</a> had the last eight years to talk about this and do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9355.978s">And</a> if they're not going to do it, then maybe it should be on the burden of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9360.359s">And</a> maybe you just you guys and girls, you just voted tonight on a CPA to give more money out, maybe to a place in the Brooks Estates. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9368.881s">But</a> put that aside. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9370.241s">If</a> you're really concerned and really serious about affordable housing, you should start putting all your pennies together on all your nickels and all your dimes and all your resources where the money can come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9380.063s">and</a> really have a second look. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9382.125s">You</a> know, when the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I think it's could be almost 12-13 years ago, came out with the CPA tax, we were supposed to, like other cities and towns, get a percentage of what the profit was on the state's annual profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9395.754s">We</a> haven't gotten anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9397.515s">So</a> you're really putting the burden right back on the Medford taxpayer, or the Medford city government to go forward and look for that type of development, look for that type of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9407.8s">Well,</a> here's your chance. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9409.361s">Before</a> you get into the, you know, Worcester just got through passing, I don't know if you folks realize it, they just got through passing on April 29th, March 9th of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9420.166s">The</a> registry as it relates to single and two family and three family homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9424.79s">They</a> had that, they voted on that in September of 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9428.311s">And</a> it took them two years before they implemented it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9432.952s">They</a> are now meeting in their next main meeting to make revisions to it because of the pushback, because there's a lot of stringent material into that registry. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9442.274s">But</a> the best part about the whole thing, as the city manager said, he's willing to make changes and tone it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9448.396s">Can</a> you imagine having, if you don't go and register, you're gonna get a $300 fine, and every single day you don't register, it's a $300 fine? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9455.837s">That's</a> kind of excessive, really excessive. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9458.898s">I</a> mean, you don't wanna go to these extremes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9461.218s">And</a> what you do wanna, if you really believe in what you're talking about, you wanna have a full-blown discussions with the pros and the cons, and how this thing can or cannot work, and how does it fit into the city of Medford's lifestyle. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9476.181s">Mr.</a> Chairman, with all due respect, I do not see large corporations coming into our city in Medford, street after street, buying and taking over real estate, turning it over and making a huge profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9488.329s">If</a> a single person, be it yourself or any member of the council, has the ability to do it, good luck to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9494.093s">That's</a> what America is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9496.074s">If</a> you're trying to reduce the rents, you're trying to reduce the cost of living, trying to reduce everything else, then speak to your state legislature, speak to your federal authorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9505.72s">They're</a> the ones that should be looking out for you, just as well as your local authorities.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9510.524s">You're</a> welcome.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_X875ms8gt_4/2024-06-01_X875ms8gt_4.html">City Council 04-02-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3186.122s">My</a> name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, former member of this August body, and I'm really getting confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3192.83s">It's</a> been almost eight years since I've been back before this council, and I've been here three times since December. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3198.697s">And</a> I feel like there's something wrong with this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3201.241s">You're</a> going in a direction that doesn't speak about the Medford City Council taking care of Medford City issues, streets, sidewalks, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3216.053s">Also,</a> my concern with this is, is the City of Medford City Council going to go into a public service agency? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3223.171s">by</a> going into housing and being property reviewers, and you talk about a registry that a homeowner has to go and apply, well, I'm quite sure you're gonna charge them a fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3234.821s">And</a> it's another money grab for the city of Medford, unfoundly, and it's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3239.805s">And</a> in the very last line of your document here, Councilor Lazzaro, I mean, excuse me, Councilor Callahan, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3248.692s">you</a> indicate that this is going to be good for our climate and our affordable housing goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3255.277s">Well,</a> let me ask you something, as you folks going to manage this, you know, you have a program here that you want to create a review between now and when I don't see any name here as it relates to a real estate group of people that should be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3270.149s">Because</a> if anybody knows the whereabouts of the city, and the renters, it would be the real estate people because they're the ones that are renting out. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3278.436s">not</a> renting in. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3279.937s">So</a> what purpose would the city council have to try to tell a real estate agent or its company that this is who you have to rent to? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3288.122s">These</a> are the type of people and then what are we going to do stop making a registry of who you are renting to and be discriminatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3295.467s">In</a> fact, in the future, toward a certain class or an ethnic group of people.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3307.569s">city</a> of Medford last year, and once again, this year put out in their documents, a it's called a notice of tenant rights and resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3317.097s">And</a> if you look into the tenants rights and resources, it also makes reference to what the state law allows you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3324.022s">Now,</a> if there's something wrong with a tenant or renter, they have many places to go, they can go to <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3331.428s">MCAD</a> in Boston, they can go to state real estate board, you can go to your right downstairs here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3337.496s">And</a> you can also go to the public health department. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3340.44s">Right</a> now they have five available ways for renter feels that they're being in frowned upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3347.088s">But</a> every good real estate broker knows whether it's in the city of Medford or any other place, that the fact of the matter is they're going to try to get the best person that they can, who can afford to pay the rent, and it's not going to be subject to a background check to their ethnic background. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3362.932s">Because</a> that unfortunately, is where this is going to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3365.992s">Because</a> once you get somebody in there, they're going to want to know where did you come from? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3370.694s">Let</a> me see your references. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3372.134s">And</a> where were you renting last? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3373.694s">That's</a> not what this council's job is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3376.816s">What</a> an answer!
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3386.119s">Pardon</a> me?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3387.7s">You</a> don't know you haven't gotten there yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3389.822s">You</a> just you just have you just I'm not gonna I'm not gonna sit here and say that we're going to hear you have discrimination as the chair as the chair.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3408.457s">I</a> didn't say you were you said you're going to put a registry.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3412.961s">Mr.</a> President, what's the registry going to include? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3415.523s">Ask</a> the maker of the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3416.924s">You</a> cannot come here with resolutions and not be able to answer the questions for what you're looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3422.288s">Then</a> you don't belong here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3423.609s">Go</a> someplace else. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3424.83s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3439.144s">I'm</a> just frustrated. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3440.825s">And</a> probably taking it out on all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3443.207s">But</a> I am taking it out on you for a particular purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3445.769s">I'm</a> going to repeat myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3446.929s">I</a> have a bad habit of repeating myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3448.931s">Please</a> just do what you were elected to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3452.613s">Well,</a> you guys went out there and campaigned and rang on the doorbells and asked people to vote for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3457.256s">Did</a> you tell him you wanted to put a registry for housing in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3460.659s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3461.019s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3471.963s">Let</a> me just conclude by saying the following.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3476.204s">Well,</a> you know something, just relax. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3478.345s">You</a> had a little do to do with their Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3481.025s">You</a> took my time up. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3482.726s">I'm</a> gonna ask Mrs. Callahan, I'm gonna ask Mrs. Callahan to withdraw the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3488.72s">and</a> think this thing through, if you really think it's worth something, come back at another day with definitive answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3495.565s">So</a> you don't have an audience that's screaming and yelling that they don't want it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3499.187s">Maybe</a> there is something that can work its way out. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3501.789s">Maybe</a> if you work with the real estate brokers in this city, it can make some kind of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3506.052s">And</a> the two person homeowner doesn't have to pay a fee to get himself registered or her registered. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3511.495s">And</a> at the same time, there's going to be none of this background check <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3515.478s">that</a> revolves itself around where I am, who I am, what my ethnic background is, what my financial status might be- Thank you, Mr. Penta, your time is up. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3523.161s">No,</a> wait a minute, wait a minute.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3524.782s">Wait</a> a minute, I'm not through yet.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3542.164s">You</a> took time away from me to talk to Councilor Scott.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11581.727s">Robert</a> Penta zero summit road former member of the August body. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11585.268s">Number</a> one local government is what it's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11587.409s">So</a> we're not talking about state government here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11589.47s">We're</a> not talking about federal government and I don't really care what was on that shot about other cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11594.673s">We're</a> talking about our city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11597.894s">And</a> for 12 consecutive years, his name was Council President Bob Miyako, it was emphasized every single night during those 12 years of city council meetings, that this was the people's forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11610.26s">This</a> is the only place that they could go for redress, whether they went to a department, the mayor, what have you, they were dissatisfied. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11617.643s">And</a> there were nights we stayed here till 12 and one o'clock in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11621.645s">And</a> that didn't bother me because that's what the job was all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11626.294s">First</a> and second of all, if you have a meeting as you've had over the past, since December now coming forward, when you have lines of people waiting to speak, let them speak first. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11636.781s">The</a> people at home, they're sitting in their chairs, they're sitting in their comfort zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11641.044s">You</a> have people here that need to go to work the next day, have paid for a babysitter, or just came down here because it's finally got to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11647.569s">Something</a> is really interested. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11649.49s">Two</a> of your free people that are sponsoring this, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11653.294s">have</a> never done anything here in the city of Medford that should even qualify them to make a result of going to two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11660.322s">And</a> then you go from two minutes to three, just like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11663.305s">I</a> mean, that's the way it was the consideration for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11665.688s">Why</a> don't you just keep it at five minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11668.351s">In</a> 2022, you went from 10 to five and everything seemed to work out. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11671.835s">And</a> the only reason why these meetings are getting to be as long as they are, unfortunately, because you're every other week. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11677.518s">So</a> maybe you should go back to being every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11680.259s">And</a> that way the the agendas won't be as long and they won't be as contentious. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11684.401s">But</a> to worry about the length of time that you would have to sit here, you get $30,000 a year to supposedly represent the people of this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11694.403s">And</a> don't you dare think you're gonna come back here and ask for a pay raise because you have to stay late at night and you do committee meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11701.966s">That's</a> crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11702.646s">If</a> anything, it would be wise for you to make a decrease in your salary because of the conditions that the city of Medford is in right now to show and put your good fest forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11710.808s">But</a> that'll never happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11712.509s">just</a> like a pay raise will probably come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11715.17s">You</a> know, the sad part about this whole thing is, again, you're spending time on what? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11720.893s">Just</a> tell me what is so bad to sit here and listen to someone for five minutes? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11726.476s">What</a> is so bad that you have to go and look at another community and see what they do? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11730.778s">You're</a> talking about Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11732.678s">And</a> if you spent your time doing your homework, when you're out there campaigning, you would realize you're talking about Medford, not Arlington, Cambridge, Somerville, Malden, or Everett, or Chelsea, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11743.944s">Let</a> me ask any one of you when you're out campaigning, and you rang the doorbells for your votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11749.106s">Did</a> you spend more than two minutes and say, I've got to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11751.827s">I</a> only give them two minutes to speak to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11753.988s">Of</a> course not. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11755.549s">That</a> would be the height of insulting. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11757.85s">But</a> you want to insult people coming up here who pay your salary with our tax dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11765.353s">That's</a> a shame, that is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11768.054s">And</a> not to single anyone out of you, I'm gonna blame all of you, because if all of you vote for the craziness of this, and I call this a stupid resolution, because it makes no sense in the interest of good government. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11781.457s">You</a> can talk about Harvard all you want, you can have your special days. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11785.458s">And</a> just as an information to Councilor Tseng, you indicated this month is Ramadan. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11789.7s">Well,</a> do you know what today is? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11791.803s">Do</a> you know what today is? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11792.584s">Today</a> is National Autism Day, sponsored by the United Nations. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11796.127s">I</a> don't see that on the calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11797.909s">That</a> to me is as important as your Ramadan. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11800.491s">But</a> you people want to talk about all these national issues and put them on the calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11804.996s">What</a> does that do to help the city of Medford, the people of Medford, to pay the taxes on a daily basis that go to work here? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11812.683s">I</a> strongly suggest the three members who put this forward, cancel it, take it off the ballot, and leave it alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11819.807s">And</a> let the good people of our city have their five minutes at the podium, have their say, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11826.25s">And</a> hopefully, if you go back to maybe every week, the amount of resolutions that you put on there won't be as contentious, and it won't be so controversial, you won't have to stay here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11836.655s">But</a> even if you do have to stay here, eat it, because that's your job. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11841.357s">That's</a> what you signed up for. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11842.938s">You</a> wanted to be a council to represent the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11845.699s">And</a> if I heard you correctly, Mr. President, you said you've spoken to people to disagree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11850.261s">So</a> to some people from an hour, two hours, whatever it might be, and you didn't accomplish anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11855.803s">You</a> spent two hours of your time on a conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11858.684s">But</a> you want to cut us down to two minutes of this podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11861.545s">That</a> makes absolutely no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11863.167s">And</a> it's absolutely contradictory to the whole premise of what this resolution is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11867.414s">Again,</a> I respectfully ask the three members who put this forward to cancel it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11871.76s">And</a> also, there's a book, it's called The Naked Socialist. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11874.924s">Anyone</a> have ever heard of it? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11876.852s">It's</a> a very interesting book, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11878.994s">It's</a> a naked socialist.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11880.735s">Pardon</a> me?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11883.558s">No,</a> it's not about you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11884.478s">I'm</a> gonna just read with you at the very conclusion of what it says. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11887.841s">This</a> goes back to 1968. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11890.423s">A</a> lady by the name of Ezra Taft Benson, she was the former secretary of agriculture under President Dwight Eisenhower, gave a speech outlining the following- Mr. Penta, you're five minutes in. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11900.952s">Regarding</a> public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11902.654s">One</a> line, and it says the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11905.376s">Government</a> may not possess more rights than those held by the individual, and government may not simply assume them as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11914.223s">When</a> it does, you're operating toward tyranny. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11916.826s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11917.646s">Let</a> me just finish, please, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11920.308s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11921.229s">I</a> would can I just finish please. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11923.17s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11924.271s">Can</a> I just finish please sentence. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11926.993s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11927.913s">I</a> would just hope that this council does not find itself being involved in the naked terrorists and any kind of socialistic communistic movement by stopping the people from speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11940.701s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15396.441s">Why</a> do I only have two when I should have five?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15400.763s">Well,</a> you're tired, you want to go home, is this all about?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15408.465s">Show</a> me the rule on the council, because rule 16 says five minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15413.227s">That's</a> what it says.

<a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12508.504s">If</a> you really want to be heroes about what you think this tax should be, you should vote tonight to end it, receive it and place it on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12517.209s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12521.178s">Number</a> two, if you really think it's that important, you should maybe in a couple of months call for a public hearing on a non election on a non Tuesday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12531.727s">And</a> that way they you can listen to the people as to what you're proposing, because what you're proposing right now, it's quite obvious, either the message got out wrong, the information isn't being heard correctly, and you people are going to send it to a committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12545.078s">And</a> what's it going to do in the committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12546.579s">either</a> you're for it or against it, because if you have it on the agenda to discuss, how much more do you need to discuss it? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12551.941s">You're</a> either for it or you're against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12553.961s">That's</a> why it's on the agenda, period. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12556.882s">Now</a> therefore, if you don't want to vote on it, and you want to refer it to a committee, well then kill it tonight, and then have a public forum if you want, and have the entire community come whenever they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12567.085s">You</a> have real estate folks out here, the real estate folks out here buy and sell homes, they're buying and selling of homes and the taxes that are paid into this community represent almost 82% of the city's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12579.116s">They</a> more than anybody understand what the real estate tax does for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12584.699s">And</a> for you now want to put a transfer tax on there for no godly reason why I don't know, you could talk about all the affordable housing you want, but you have no plan in front of you, you have no locations, multiply, you have no reason and no dollar amount ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12599.807s">But</a> what about the proposal next to the old GE place that was supposed to be affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12604.112s">What</a> about where Bertucci's is with the science, public science building was going to go, what about a mystic Avenue 500 mystic Avenue where there's going to be a proposal for 500 units in commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12615.875s">You've</a> got locations here. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12617.077s">You</a> talked about your first time in 30 years, you're doing a rezoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12619.939s">Well,</a> where's the rezoning? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12621.121s">Where</a> is the rezoning here tonight that you can present to the people of this community where affordable housing is going to go? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12626.506s">You</a> don't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12627.387s">You</a> haven't brought in the real estate people so they could see so they could work with you as a council so they could understand what your needs might be so they would have an idea of what they can buy and what they can sell for the people that they have to deal with on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12640.814s">have</a> to understand something. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12642.796s">These</a> people are upset out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12644.417s">They're</a> upset only because of the way it's come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12647.62s">Don't</a> forget, you had the meeting canceled. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12649.582s">And</a> now it's here in their mind, they're thinking it's a 2% tax, it's going to go out. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12654.247s">So</a> why don't we just forget the tax? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12657.11s">Why</a> don't you just forget this resolution? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12659.272s">And</a> if you guys and girls really think <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12661.954s">It's</a> worthy of having a conversation to call for public hearing and see what the input is. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12667.856s">Rather</a> than saying it's going to be 2%, 1%, it's going to be at a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12672.138s">The</a> lady that was on there, she hit it right on the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12674.378s">She</a> bought a house for $44,000, then she paid 68,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12677.88s">She</a> was the American dream. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12680.841s">And</a> why should she be penalized in her senior years of her senior American dream that she would have that money that she would have to give back that's not going to her. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12697.025s">You</a> know, we're talking about a democracy each and every day with this political election that's coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12702.252s">Right</a> now, what you folks are talking about, socialism. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12705.556s">You</a> think you should be sharing your people's products. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12716.934s">It's</a> wrong to get in this mode. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12720.599s">And</a> I don't really think this council really wants to travel down this road. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12725.146s">But</a> if you really want to be genuine about this issue, rather than refer to committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12730.854s">I</a> would strongly suggest that one of you, if not many of you, make a motion to receive it in place and on file tonight, and then call for a public hearing, two or three weeks, when the entire city of Metro would have an opportunity to come and speak, not like this.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_FLTVHcz7fAI/2024-06-01_FLTVHcz7fAI.html">City Council 01-23-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9763.941s">My</a> name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass, former member of this August body. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9770.385s">First</a> of all, let me start by saying, what does this pay raise have to do with education? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9777.142s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9777.902s">Number</a> two, there's no demanding from the public for any pay raise for the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9783.785s">And</a> lastly, there's no professional city population job description pay report that even substantiates or supports what the council has alluded to. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9794.829s">The</a> gender issue that was alleged this past December is nothing more than a sexual red herring allegation of discrimination that has no merit to the issue before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9806.494s">The</a> job is what the job is. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9807.995s">The</a> responsibility is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9809.456s">It</a> doesn't say it has to be male or female. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9813.66s">That's</a> the red herring to the whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9815.541s">But</a> if this proposal were to pass, should we now compare all our municipal positions with the same amount of financial equity and equality as compared to each position, especially with those having different responsibilities? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9829.052s">Fire,</a> police, school teachers, they all have different job duties and responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9834.841s">But</a> if we're looking at something that's now saying the school committee should have equity pay to that of a city councilor, well, you're setting a standard here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9842.388s">And</a> this standard should be compared to, right now, what is presently found in your municipal contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9849.275s">Additionally,</a> if this proposal is to pass a comprehensive review, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9854.56s">should</a> be undertaking to set a years of service pay scale to be compatible with all of the municipal employee negotiations, comparing newly elected newcomers to both the city council and the school committee at the beginning of the pay scale formula. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9869.046s">Therefore,</a> for the new members in the council, as compared to the new members on the school committee, why should either one of you reap the benefit of the maximum pay <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9878.63s">when</a> in fact all other municipal employees start at a base pay and they go through a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9885.112s">So</a> if you're looking at this equity for both and all sides, then let the council and the school committee also be put in the same type of position. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9896.533s">Okay,</a> as such by granting the city council additional type of raise without having increasing any educational value, without having any community support for it, and without any professional city population job description report only demonstrates the power of behind the scenes internal politics, where the power of the dollar personally overpowers the needs of our public school educational needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9924.972s">We</a> have surrounding communities, and I took the six surrounding communities that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9928.674s">Arlington,</a> they get paid $3,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9931.275s">Everett,</a> they get paid $11,500. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9933.036s">Malden,</a> they get paid $7,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9934.917s">Somerville,</a> they get paid $16,600. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9936.218s">And</a> Methodist, they get paid $12,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9938.639s">Methodist</a> is the second highest paid school committee of the surrounding areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9944.468s">You</a> serve in these jobs for the quality of giving good education to the community, not for how much money or you should be paid equal to that or in excess of our total to the amount of what a city councilor makes. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9959.321s">Last</a> December, the pay concerns for paraprofessionals, classroom assistants, custodians, substitute teachers, et cetera, were discussed, but they've yet to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9969.509s">This</a> hall was full with almost 200 teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9972.938s">At</a> the city council, the school committee pay raise increase without any proposal to differentiate the differences between the city council and school committee responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9982.09s">As</a> the gentleman just stated, showing the need such raise or pay equality has yet to be proven. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9989.397s">Therefore,</a> at last meeting on December 12, these were the issues that were of concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9995.261s">A,</a> needing additional instructional hours for students, AP classes, class size needs, athletic programming, student activities, school library resources, counseling services, school security, custodial school maintenance, after school programming, and something that's gonna creep up on you fellas, it's unprepared for migrant student educational <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10019.219s">studies</a> and support. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10021.381s">Now,</a> these are all dollar amounts that need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10024.923s">And</a> if you are going to take on the proposal that's before us over the next two years, approximately $76,000, you're taking that $76,000 away from your school department educational budget that could be used somehow to get into some of these programs, if not all of them, to some degree and a percentage of whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10045.762s">The</a> pay scale for those caring for these programs was at issue, and yet as of today, nothing has been done to resolve any of the issues as presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10055.033s">The</a> City Council School Committee pay raise proposal does not recognize and connect to the short and long term needs of our public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10063.664s">So</a> when and if you folks are sitting here and you're discussing these needs, and you think that the school committee should be making more money, and you have a school committee that's been around for so many years, allegedly for 20, if that's what the issue is, well then let's, what do we need to motivate and show that their need and they're worthy of it other than <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10082.987s">You</a> know, they should be making the same as in Worcester. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10086.568s">They</a> have an audience that does say up to 50% of what a city council makes. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10090.19s">But</a> their job responsibilities may be entirely different. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10092.851s">Do</a> you realize right now, a kindergarten assistant, if we were to follow this pay raise as proposed, a kindergarten assistant who works five days a week and is subject to everything in that classroom as every other teacher, will be making $1,000 less <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10110.336s">then</a> this pay proposal for a school committee person, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10113.937s">Makes</a> no sense at all because a school committee person doesn't have to sign in, doesn't have to check in, has no responsibility as it relates to, you know, what am I doing on a daily basis that says I'm doing something that's educationally correct for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10128.763s">By</a> granting from the city council, let's put it this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10134.906s">There</a> should be some justification before you folks <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10138.43s">from,</a> and it can't be from the at present school committee because there'd be a conflict of interest because they have a financial gain from it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10144.793s">So</a> it's gotta be as according to the state law, the chapter is gonna come from your folks in the state council. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10149.836s">But</a> what has this school committee done, especially with its new members that has said Medford's education is better, Medford's discipline is better, and that's seriously questioned as to what's going on up at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10163.439s">The</a> sports programs is getting better. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10165.76s">Parents</a> are getting more involved, but also at the same time, where is the educational standard in comparison to other cities and towns throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10176.283s">Has</a> the school committee made such great strides that, hey, they're working together with the teachers and their organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10184.365s">When</a> you had here last week, and I know you have some new folks that are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10188.787s">On</a> December 12th, there was almost 150, 175 teachers that were here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10193.2s">And</a> they explain to you the plight of not only being in the classroom, being attacked, where their pay is. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10200.203s">Some</a> of them have to work five years, five years before they even make $25,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10206.905s">That's</a> unconscionable. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10208.666s">Justin,</a> I understand that you want to give them a pay raise, you know, but I didn't hear your logic behind it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10215.929s">Well,</a> he's the one, it's his resolution.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10222.679s">Okay,</a> through the chair, Justin, I know you wanna give them this Bay Race, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10227.441s">But</a> you haven't said anything, none of you have expressed any comment as it relates to, they deserve it for the value of what they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10235.224s">Can</a> anybody explain to me, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10237.765s">If</a> you really want to give somebody a pay raise, isn't the job description and your job duties and your employer supposed to do the review of you? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10246.208s">Now,</a> of course they can say, the Medford taxpayer is your reviewer and you run for office and they elect you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10252.25s">Okay,</a> that's all well and good. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10254.251s">But</a> the Medford taxpayer doesn't pay your salary, it's the Medford City Council according to state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10259.997s">So</a> the Medford City Council, by right, can make a great demand on this school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10264.499s">If</a> you really want to improve it, we'll look at this in two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10267.68s">Let's</a> see what this new school committee does over the next two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10270.801s">Let's</a> just see through your intervention with the Medford Teachers Association and from the superintendent all the way down, that everything that's taking place in all our schools, from kindergarten all the way up to the high school, has gotten better. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10282.004s">Grades</a> have gotten better. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10283.925s">Discipline</a> has gotten better and under control. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10288.174s">That</a> would make a big difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10289.575s">And</a> maybe people might say, hey, okay, you're working toward it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10293.216s">But</a> when you have a job that you don't have to sign in, check in and give any report as to what you do and why you're doing how you do it, and expect to start off at a higher rate than people who have been here for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10305.782s">That's</a> just not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10307.643s">And</a> the last thing, let me just say this as it relates to that, and I told you Arlington gets $3,000, Everett gets $11,500, Malden gets $7,000, Somerville gets $16,500, and Method gets $12,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10318.977s">We're</a> the second highest one of the surrounding communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10323.723s">A</a> kindergarten <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10325.609s">through</a> the chair to Justin, a kindergarten teacher assistant after the second year gets $21,568. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10332.391s">That's</a> $1,000 less than what you wanna propose to a school committee person who doesn't go to this job every day, like the kindergarten teacher goes to school every day, five days a week, and does everything that education says of that person. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10350.556s">Maybe</a> you should have a sit down. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10352.912s">with</a> the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10354.713s">Because</a> they can't tell you that they want it because it would be a financial benefit to them, that would be a conflict of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10361.578s">But</a> somebody needs to understand, just because they need to get paid more, because they're not getting paid enough now. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10368.383s">Well,</a> they're getting paid $12,000, and if they don't want it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10371.545s">And</a> through the chair to Mrs. Callahan, not for anything, you made the comment that you think that, you know, to get good candidates, you need to pay more. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10379.63s">I'm</a> gonna respectfully disagree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10381.992s">a</a> good candidate is someone who wants to run for the job because they believe that better things can be done and I can do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10388.195s">And</a> if I can't do it, then the people won't reelect me that salary has got nothing to do with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10394.017s">And</a> the salary should not be used for your own personal gain. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10397.779s">I'm</a> going to make $30,000 a year now more 24,000, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10401.861s">And</a> the sad part about the whole thing in conclusion, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10404.815s">If</a> this proposal were to go through, you're taking $74,000 a year out of this Medford School Department education budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10413.077s">It's</a> bad enough now for them to work on a daily basis without having enough of the money that should be in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10419.558s">Now</a> you're gonna take another $74,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10421.339s">And</a> you know, where does that go? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10424.379s">How</a> do you explain that to the Medford taxpayer? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10426.86s">You</a> can't explain it to me because I wouldn't buy it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10429.921s">Because</a> right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10431.596s">The</a> Medford School Committee is working with all they can do just to maintain their budget and to get by and to start taking more money away to give it to an elected official who does absolutely nothing to enhance or embellish or make better school education. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10450.595s">That's,</a> it just doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10453.296s">So</a> if I understand you correctly, I believe you said you would like to have this go and have a decision come up by the end of December of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10460.479s">I</a> believe that's what you said. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10462.259s">That</a> would be okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10463.4s">But</a> to vote on this tonight, I think it would be wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10466.721s">I</a> think it would serve no purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10468.622s">And</a> I don't think it would be good for Medford public school education. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10472.483s">That's</a> my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10473.544s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10506.561s">Can</a> I ask a question to the chair? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10507.901s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10508.482s">Did</a> I misunderstand Mrs. Cowell? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10510.283s">Did</a> you say in part of your questioning there is, I think you- She listed a variety of different reforms, rank choice- All right, it was one of the things that you said you wanted illegal aliens to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10520.887s">Did</a> you say that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10537.305s">Oh,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10541.468s">I'm</a> more than happy to answer any questions.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11251.067s">Yeah,</a> just a point of information, just as a notice for this council, I think it was three, maybe five to six years ago, there was a report that came back from the Department of Revenue, Mass Department of Revenue that said, the old school thought was in the council budget, you could only decrease, but that's not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11266.959s">You</a> can now make appropriations that go the other way. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11270.722s">So</a> I think it's just something I think you really need to take into consideration as it relates to something that you might see in the budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11277.438s">where</a> the old school was that you only could reduce if you wanted to save money, so there would be no way that you could transfer that money to another section, but that's not true because now you can look at certain sections within your budget as it relates to appropriating for or making something less. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11294.267s">And</a> I think that would be very key, so let's stick to your, Councilor Collins' comment as it relates to this could be a beginning step. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11304.192s">If</a> it's going to be a beginning step, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11306.753s">it</a> should be a step that parallels every single municipal employee from step one. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11311.897s">Some</a> school teachers, I believe, have 10 steps before they get to the top, but an elected official has no steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11319.082s">It's</a> never been that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11319.802s">So</a> if you're going to put everybody into the same genre, so to speak, well then maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11325.786s">An</a> elected person can maybe have five or six steps, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11328.849s">Don't</a> forget, one of the real benefits of an elected official is if you serve for 10 years or more, you get a pension. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11336.236s">You</a> get a pension from here, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11338.999s">There</a> are some cities and towns that don't offer pensions. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11342.478s">So</a> besides the salary, you're also getting the benefit of a pension with a minimum of 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11349.283s">So</a> I think that really needs to be taken into consideration when you're talking about pay scales and pay raises and whether it be for the council or the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11357.682s">And</a> one of the things that seemed to be a juggernaut in the school and the municipal side is just that particular issue, whether it's in the fire or the police department when they're in their pension areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11368.813s">So</a> it's really something that serves you folks with a good benefit, school department issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11376.064s">school</a> committee person, same thing as a city councilor, but you really, you just don't want to throw that aside without realizing that you're getting a benefit that a lot of cities and towns do not offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11389.536s">So</a> just thought I'd let you know.<h2><a href="../2024-10-05_j424Dcv3DNY/2024-10-05_j424Dcv3DNY.html">City Council 12-12-23</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4111.271s">I</a> have a two-page statement.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4113.992s">My</a> name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., a former member of this August party on the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4120.255s">Massachusetts</a> General Laws, Chapter 71, Section 52, does grant to the City Council, by a majority vote and by the city charter, the responsibility of how much members of the school committee get paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4132.02s">But</a> historically, the city council has paid more than the city school committee because the council's responsibilities exceed those of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4139.885s">The</a> city council responsibilities include, but are not limited to enacting ordinances, zoning, fire and police, public safety requirements, setting the city's tax rate, and has the final authority over the city and school department budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4153.895s">As</a> examples of major differences between one challenging equal pay for equal work between the city council and the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4162.38s">Further,</a> just as in any business, job responsibilities and pay are what one is applying for. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4168.324s">Under</a> this proposal, it is a gender attack being disguised as pay parity, for equal pay for equal work, for which it is not. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4176.008s">The</a> proposed school department 100% plus pay increase will be paid from the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4181.952s">Let's</a> take a look at what that means. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4184.233s">Annually,</a> we are barely able to meet the resources we have now at our school's disposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4190.282s">If</a> we cut further any of our school resources by not funding them, and instead giving them 100% plus salary increase for school committee members, we should be concerned as to where we are heading. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4201.477s">If</a> we are to cut some $90,000, because that's what it'll come to, plus each year from going forward from the school department budget, the results can possibly affect the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4211.306s">Fewer</a> instructional hours for students. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4213.748s">Elimination</a> of AP classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4215.89s">Increased</a> class sizes. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4217.531s">Elimination</a> of some athletic programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4219.853s">Elimination</a> of support for some school activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4222.736s">Elimination</a> of school librarians.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4226.486s">I</a> think the rules say five minutes if you check the council rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4229.429s">Reductions</a> in council services, school security being at risk, reduced custodial cleaning and maintenance, after school programming, migrant student education support, and unbeing prepared for migrant student educational support. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4244.904s">I</a> meant the public schools short and long range term should not be subject to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4249.387s">And</a> if the school committee pay increase does go through, what do you say about the salary for the everyday school paraprofessionals? <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4257.051s">As</a> example, every class assistant under five years would finally earn $30,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4261.593s">And</a> everyday kindergarten teachers after five years would only earn $25,980. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4268.462s">This</a> after five years, while the school committee would receive $29,000 annually for a part time job with no everyday reporting requirements and responsibilities is at best. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4280.952s">If</a> the city council is to accept this ridiculous proposal, maybe the council should then set a pay scale standard for both the city council and the school committee for years of service as compared to pay scales a standard for just every other municipal employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4296.577s">Using</a> the presently proposed gender issue of females being more in number who are elected to serve is not only discriminatory, but a sexist allegation that has no merit. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4309.824s">And</a> what about a person who claims to be other? <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4313.525s">And</a> what about when trends tend to go back to when men become more elected than women? <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4319.048s">Being</a> elected is a gender neutral opportunity, not to be disguised as pay parity for equal pay for equal work. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4326.555s">As</a> I said in the beginning, job responsibilities and pay are the guidelines for which one is applying for. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4333.001s">As</a> of this meeting, there has been no input from community members on the Medford School Committee regarding this 100 plus salary increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4343.69s">As</a> a thought, and this flows right into what you said Councilor Scarpelli, if the council is so inclined to accept this measure of allowing this red herring issue of more females than males being elected officials, then maybe in the spirit of physical conservatism and the council being magnanimous, the council should entertain <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4363.806s">being</a> paid the same $12,000, as we said before, annual salary that the school committee is currently paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4370.447s">Therefore,</a> on the city side, if the city can save $90,000 annually from their city council salary, which can be used for municipal needs, the school department, one sentence, the school department will not lose the $90,000 annually that can go to public school education.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8548.132s">of</a> what you've got going through right now is the fact that you just have a nice brand new baby, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8552.373s">And</a> you're a brand new mother. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8553.934s">And</a> that's very important for what I wanna say, because there's a cost factor that goes along with all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8560.436s">It's</a> a mental factor and it's a financial factor. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8563.236s">And</a> I'm quite sure you realize what it costs now having a young child, what that entails on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8569.538s">When</a> we hear the fact right now that there are additional pressures that are gonna be placed on individuals, <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8576.297s">whether</a> it's a single family, because that's the only one we heard, it was a single family. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8580.258s">We</a> didn't hear about the two family, the three family, the condos, or the apartment dwellers. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8585.38s">We</a> didn't hear that, that information hasn't been brought forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8588.201s">And</a> it should have been brought forward if you're going to be thorough in this presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8592.203s">And</a> when you wanna talk about spending, or controlled spending, you need to talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8598.925s">So</a> as Councilor Knight has alluded to, <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8602.203s">not</a> thinking this be the right way to go, and I agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8605.704s">You've</a> never really had, as Councilor Marks alluded to, an outside independent order on every single department that would justify this council going into an administrative decision with the city administration to discuss, we need to now go into a Proposition 2 1⁄2 override. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8624.591s">You</a> folks are sitting here tonight with not one city administration here. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8629.409s">I</a> don't know if they were asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8631.192s">I</a> don't know if it was intentional for them not to be asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8634.777s">But</a> it would have made a big difference in trying to understand why we are at this stage at 12 and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8642.928s">Two</a> and a half weeks ago, you folks voted at a budget meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8646.855s">At</a> the beginning of the meeting, you voted seven to nothing not to approve the budget, but after the mayor came in and a quarter or two in the morning, you voted seven to nothing for the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8655.263s">So</a> what was asked for and what was gotten all took place between seven o'clock and quarter to in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8661.93s">Now,</a> is that an exact budget science? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8663.972s">I</a> don't think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8665.69s">Is</a> that the right way to go? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8667.331s">You</a> have a proposition here tonight being proposed to $12 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8670.874s">Where</a> is the statistical information? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8673.576s">Where</a> are the reports? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8675.438s">Where</a> are the reports from the school department? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8677.539s">Not</a> one school committee person is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8679.701s">Not</a> one school administration person is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8682.063s">The</a> superintendent should be here if she thought she was gonna be so lucky to get almost $6 million out of a $12 million proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8689.369s">And</a> then we go on the city side, <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8691.31s">We're</a> there. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8692.23s">You</a> have seven unions in this community, but there only seems to be two that have been recognized here. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8697.052s">And</a> very conveniently, they don't mention the Veterans Affairs Office, the veterans in this community who paid who paid through their lives for us to be here and give our commentary. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8712.157s">To</a> be exact, you need reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8714.658s">And</a> the only way you can have a good report is to make sure that you require it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8720.66s">Now,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8722.843s">I</a> think I heard Councilor, I don't know where he disappeared to it's his resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8727.148s">You</a> know, Councilor Bears I believe said you know we've been asking for the last seven months and this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8733.355s">And</a> the mayor hasn't come around. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8735.017s">Well</a> you know something, who has the greatest power in this city to control the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8740.987s">It's</a> the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8743.069s">And</a> what you also can do at any one given time, whatever that mayor, he or she wants, this council can vote against it until you guys and girls get what you want and what you ask for, because that's the way the game is played. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8757.18s">I'll</a> help you if you help me, but if you're not gonna help me and you just go along and you vote for it, well, you're just as much <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8764.805s">Just</a> as much to blame think about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8767.046s">You've</a> allowed these budgets to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8769.466s">And</a> if you know they knew this was going on, and you did nothing about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8773.787s">And</a> if you started in January asking for these financial reports and you didn't get them. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8778.669s">Then</a> you should have stopped anything that came from the mayor's office, looking for approval until you got your reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8784.47s">Your</a> responsibility and for the city is to run its financial management, and when you have intermittent and you don't have administrators in this building that can come forward to explain what 12 and a half million dollars will do more than $550 on a single family home. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8801.693s">You</a> got the doubles. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8802.713s">What</a> about the commercial piece of people property. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8805.394s">You</a> haven't even discussed them, and in the following years they keep going after two and a half automatically goes up each and every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8811.975s">It's</a> something to really think about, because this is not chump change. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8815.776s">This</a> isn't $1, $2, or $3 million that you probably could find if you went through that budget and you cut through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8822.258s">This</a> is $12 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8824.439s">And</a> who come up with the $12 million? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8826.9s">Two</a> Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8828.74s">Two</a> Councilors who don't even pay real estate tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8831.441s">They</a> don't understand the value.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8853.836s">I'm</a> gonna continue what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8855.277s">If</a> you understood, if you paid real estate tax, you would understand the impact that this would.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8904.473s">Now,</a> you maybe missed my point. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8906.634s">My</a> point was this, not owning the real estate and having to pay those additional taxes, that gets itself disseminated down to you as a renter. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8914.936s">So</a> if you, as a renter, are gonna pay the difference in the increase, but you're putting the burden back onto the who. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8920.578s">And</a> if she has a tax, if she's paying a rental tax, <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8924.019s">that</a> she can afford right now, maybe about a two or $300 a month increase, she won't be able to and that's what we're talking about people on fixed incomes, seniors on fixed income. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8934.005s">And</a> when you hear the story, when you're watching on television, every dollar counts. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8938.127s">Is</a> it going to be for my medicine? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8939.708s">Is</a> it going to be for my where I'm living? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8941.949s">Is</a> it going to be to put gas in my car? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8943.71s">Is</a> it going to be for food? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8945.091s">Is</a> it going to be that I can't go out? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8946.532s">I</a> got to stay home? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8948.153s">That's</a> what we're dealing with right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8949.435s">You're</a> dealing with an economic impact in this country that's affecting everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8953.32s">And</a> that $12 million will kill this city of Medford because the city of Medford will never recover from something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8960.65s">If</a> you vote for that, you're going to... <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8963.333s">If</a> you vote for that $12 million, you're going to take away what Medford is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8968.536s">Councilor</a> Knight was absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8970.777s">Sit</a> down, have a discussion, go over the whole thing, and ask for an independent outside audit to address all these departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8978.942s">That's</a> what you need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8983.224s">You</a> know, we're too good of a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8984.965s">We</a> are way too good of a city to let something like this happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8989.552s">We've</a> sat here for years with former Councilors and myself, and we never, never experienced anything that was presented in the middle of the night. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9000.559s">That's</a> what July is, it's the heat of the night, it's hot out, it's almost 90 degrees. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9006.413s">where</a> the people that this hall should be full of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9009.617s">And</a> it's not because as Councilman alluded to, there was an issue way back a couple of two or three years ago in Mystic Avenue in the month of August when they had a public hearing and all the people showed up and they got so scared as to what's going on, they canceled the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9022.412s">And</a> after they canceled the meeting, they took the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9024.835s">No</a> way should this happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9026.757s">Let</a> me just leave you with this last thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9029.499s">Your</a> own Rule 19 on the Medford City Council states that the Medford City Council shall not approve of any bond or expenditure that does not have a written explanation of such expenditure at least seven days prior to said vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9044.229s">You</a> got this three to four days prior to today. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9047.652s">That's</a> not seven days. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9049.353s">You</a> cannot even vote on this tonight because your own rules say it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9053.676s">And</a> your own rules also state <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9057.012s">The</a> following any financial paper appearing on the council agenda for the first time, shall be automatically laid on the table for one week when such action is requested by any one member, I'm quite sure there was at least one number here willing to put that on the table unless they have another motion to go by, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9075.965s">I</a> didn't mean to get to an argument with you and I wasn't trying to be right. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9078.546s">I</a> was just trying to compliment you. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9079.607s">I</a> got my day years mixed up. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9081.528s">The</a> fact of the matter is I look at individuals today and I say to myself, how do they afford seven $800,000 houses? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9090.712s">How</a> do they afford when they have two cars and they have kids running all over? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9093.833s">Maybe</a> you must be maxed out to the answer degree in debt. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9098.447s">We</a> never did that growing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9099.848s">We</a> worked for everything we got and we went along as we went. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9103.452s">This</a> is huge, $12 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9106.315s">This</a> isn't $1 million or even two that maybe you can figure out how to massage your budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9112.521s">It</a> doesn't work that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9114.86s">to</a> be good Councilors, dismiss this action right now, move yourself into a committee to meet with department heads, hire an outside independent auditor to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9126.406s">If</a> you could spend, as Councilor Knight said, $300,000 for an outside law firm that should be doing exactly what this law firm and the city of Medford is paying for, there is something wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9139.013s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-18_Blp3jbNtrXg/2024-11-18_Blp3jbNtrXg.html">City Council 05-10-22</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5456.479s">My</a> name is Robert Panto. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5457.54s">I</a> live at Zero Summit Road, a former member of this August body for 36 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5462.958s">For</a> the past 82 years in the city of Medford, you folks have had weekly council meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5469.04s">I've</a> served under both a plan A and a plan E form of government, and they held steadfast, not only to their weekly meetings, they held steadfast that this microphone, this podium right here was the people's voice on a weekly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5485.506s">We've</a> gone through the years, situations, <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5489.849s">in</a> the Wellington area, whereas if you were on every other week situation, the rat problem that took effect a few years ago, would have never got itself involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5500.758s">Then</a> Councilor Caraviello, Councilor Knight can remember people coming from the Morrison Ave Park area regarding in the wintertime storms that took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5509.846s">And</a> if the people had to wait every other week to come down here, their problems would have been exacerbated. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5516.12s">You</a> talked about making decisions as you relate of committee meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5520.842s">If</a> committee meetings are a result of what takes place here at a city council meeting and forwarded to a committee, and the committee does whatever it's work has to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5530.386s">It</a> still has to come back before the council, but it initiated itself right here in the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5535.848s">Tonight</a> was a perfect example. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5538.069s">When</a> the gentleman from the. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5540.555s">front</a> porch came down here and unfortunately all the papers weren't in order until the clerk went downstairs to get the papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5548.878s">Now,</a> if the papers were not there, he would have had to wait two weeks if this process of two weeks took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5554.72s">That</a> would have been a financial burdensome on that individual through no fault of his own because his papers were filed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5561.002s">And</a> when the chairperson got the papers and he saw they weren't filed and they were signed off properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5566.744s">When</a> all of you folks ran for office like myself, I knew it was on a Tuesday night and I also knew that no matter what the day and the week was, was immaterial to the job and my responsibility to do the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5581.018s">Now,</a> if you folks wanna go to every other week with 18 committees that you have set up, and of those 18 committees, if you decide you wanna have three or four of them or five of them on every other week, and some of you are on the same committees, how is that gonna work during the same time? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5597.304s">It's</a> just impossible. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5599.645s">Right</a> now, you can meet anywhere, as Councilor Scarpelli alluded to, you can go Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and you're meeting every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5606.773s">This</a> podium is here for one particular reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5609.875s">This</a> is the safeguard that a taxpaying citizen has to come here without having to wait, geez, I gotta wait two weeks because the pressing need is happening right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5620.923s">You</a> folks are getting paid $30,000 a year to do this job. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5625.807s">And</a> you know what the time commitment was. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5627.789s">And</a> you also know what the dollar amount was to the salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5631.444s">God</a> forbid, if you ever go to every other week, you want to come in here and ask for a pay raise, you really will be adding insult to injury. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5638.588s">Because</a> that's just something that will never pass the muster of why you folks got elected. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5644.332s">You</a> got elected to do one thing, to represent the people the best way you could. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5649.755s">And</a> right now for 82 years it's been every Tuesday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5653.336s">Now</a> Councilor Caraviello says change is good, but all change at all times is not good. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5660.197s">The</a> lack of community input to every other meeting, the lack of a community input as it relates to why are we making this change? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5667.979s">You</a> have two brand new city councils that just came on this term. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5671.92s">I'm</a> quite sure when they were running for office, this was not an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5675.861s">And</a> since it wasn't an issue then, why is it an issue now? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5680.222s">Second</a> of all, when you go into the meetings, you talk about the regular meetings of the city council shall be held every two weeks on Tuesday evening at 7pm, beginning the first Tuesday in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5694.507s">Then</a> in the last sentence, it turns around and says the following bit further resolve that these updates become effective on September 1 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5704.742s">So</a> what is it, September 1st or is it January 1st of 2023? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5708.263s">There's</a> a mix of words there, something is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5714.364s">Also</a> you talk about here, an emergency meeting shall take place unless immediately undelayed action is deemed to be imperative. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5725.687s">Well,</a> just think about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5727.267s">Does</a> any one of you know right now what an immediate action could be? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5731.588s">What</a> an emergency could be in somebody's life? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5734.705s">or</a> some business. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5737.867s">Pardon</a> me? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5739.928s">Does</a> anybody know what an emergency could be? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5742.229s">I</a> don't, and neither one of us know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5750.274s">I'm</a> talking about the community interest for this to make this change.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5774.743s">You</a> presented on the agenda for this evening, the word meetings, and this is a result of the change that took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5780.207s">So</a> is it January 1st or is it September 1st? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5783.13s">What's</a> it going to be?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5785.431s">So</a> if it's September 1st, then it does not become operative January 1st, but that's not the issue.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5835.017s">No,</a> it doesn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5835.557s">It</a> says in the bottom. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5836.797s">Yeah,</a> September 1st.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5841.978s">I</a> don't think this is no devil coming from the sky.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5852.298s">Thank</a> you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5854.1s">The</a> fact of the matter is simply this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5856.141s">The</a> reason why we're here on a Tuesday night is whether, like last week, you folks only met for maybe 30, 35 minutes, and you've had a pretty easy go from January till now, but once the budget comes in and things start to pick up, okay, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5868.012s">But</a> imagine if you had it every other week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5870.474s">And</a> once the budget takes place and you start to get into every other week, and you're here four, five, six hours, and then you're going to put a time limit on because you're incapable of probably making an intelligent decision because it's kind of like late night. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5884.042s">Why</a> do you want to disturb something that has worked? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5887.664s">And</a> more importantly, if you felt such a need for this, and if this council was <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5894.488s">so</a> engrossed in the fact that we had to change this, then why don't you just make it effective beginning September of the next election? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5901.572s">Why</a> would you do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5902.352s">It</a> wasn't even an election issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5903.993s">So</a> how did this become an issue right now, less than six months into the term?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5928.783s">I</a> understand that, but it's been while it's been, it's not like it didn't come out of the, it came out of the blue, but while it's been discussed, it never got passed.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5940.889s">So</a> the question is to the metric citizenry who are watching this, they're going to have to figure out, they only can come here every other week, but at the same time, at the same time, you have 18 committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5950.154s">So</a> are we going to say between the first week and the beginning of the second week, these 18 committees are going to work and your committee, the holes are going to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5958.512s">I</a> mean, is that going to make any kind of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5961.055s">There's</a> 18 committees and there's only seven of you, and many of you are on the same committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5965.861s">I</a> mean, so how do you, how do you go through this, this process.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5991.247s">You</a> know what I mean, it's the only place for a public forum, you've got your opinion, I have a forum on what it's a public forum for someone to come and speak on whatever the issue might be, it might be a neighborhood issue that doesn't find itself on the agenda, it might be an emergency that doesn't find itself on the agenda.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6016.653s">You</a> have your opinion, I have mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6018.534s">As</a> far as that goes, Madam President, I said what I had to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6021.816s">I</a> just feel, like I said, it's been 82 years, it's operated under plan E, plan A. It's been every Tuesday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6029.38s">You</a> never really know what the situation might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6031.482s">And</a> when you got elected, you knew. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6033.283s">You</a> knew when you got elected, the meetings were going to be every Tuesday night and subcommittees were whenever they're going to take you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6039.066s">And</a> why should time? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6041.047s">Why</a> should time even be an issue? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6043.089s">Whether</a> you meet one night a week or whether you meet four times a week, that's what you got elected for. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6047.732s">And</a> whatever the issues are, they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6053.556s">Well,</a> being elected never bothered me to go to a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6059.175s">And</a> if it was every week, I went every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6061.976s">If</a> it was two or three times a week, we would meet two or three times a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6065.657s">And</a> let me just conclude by saying the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6068.078s">If</a> in fact, this council feels that they now want to change to every other week, please do not put anything on the agenda that asks for pay raise, because you would really be insulting the people of this community.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6087.545s">No,</a> that's not what I said. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6089.486s">What</a> I said is if you're going to make this vote to go to every other week, please don't come back and vote in support of a pay raise for yourself, because then $30,000 for every other week becomes overpaid. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6102.47s">And</a> as Councilor Caraviello alluded to, when he made his comments two weeks ago, if you go to every other week, maybe you should reduce your salary from 30 to 15,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6109.813s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6975.109s">I'm</a> Robert Pentezero, Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6977.41s">I</a> believe a couple of weeks ago, this council passed two resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6980.693s">One</a> was a million dollars for new sidewalks, and I believe the second one was for $250,000 to remove tree stumps. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6987.497s">But</a> there was no identification of where the sidewalks were going to go over and beyond money for new panels, and there was no identification as to what tree stumps were going to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6997.404s">Now,</a> over the past few years, here in Medford, former public works director had one, <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7003.688s">two</a> types of lists, one for tree stumps, and one for sidewalks, but unfortunately when the council passed at this time nobody asked that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7011.173s">So</a> as a citizen, the council did ask, they asked a question of where they're going to be located, the tree stumps, and the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7018.778s">So</a> is there any way that that could be made a public disclosure, either on this, we don't have any city newspaper anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7025.623s">So</a> method patch, or in the city web page could that go on there as soon as we get it, we can put it in, we have a dry folder. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7033.088s">Madam</a> President, you say as soon as you get I understand that but you should have had it the night that you took the vote.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7051.887s">But,</a> but is there a list right now that it is available.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7063.536s">So</a> then just a very simple question, not to beg the issue, but maybe it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7067.498s">I</a> mean, you get something to vote on, especially tree stumps, much more than sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7073.803s">Those</a> locations should have identified. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7075.484s">This</a> is the third time something like this has been presented to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7079.207s">So</a> did you get the first two lists? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7083.51s">I</a> mean, have any of these lists <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7086.187s">tree</a> stumps from the first of the second list even been taken care of some of them with duplicates especially on sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7091.488s">It's</a> just a thought because some residents are saying a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7094.149s">There's</a> a lot of money for sidewalks.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7128.295s">Is</a> it possible, Madam President, you can just secure a list for both?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7139.461s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7139.741s">Of</a> course. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7140.301s">Okay.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-11-19_kp64eg_WEKE/2024-11-19_kp64eg_WEKE.html">City Council 12-21-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4053.299s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5144.967s">My</a> name is Robert Pantazzo, Summit Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5147.468s">And</a> what subject would you be speaking on, sir? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5149.329s">I'd</a> speak on the Ambulatory Surgical Center up at the location of the Lawrence Memorial Hospital at 170 Governor's Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5159.495s">The</a> reason why I'm bringing this up was after reviewing your city budget and recognizing that you folks set a tax rate this past week, unless I missed it all together, there was no inclusion at all as it related to the amount of money that the new ambulatory service center would be bringing to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5180.813s">I</a> believe this past, last past Tuesday, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5184.056s">On</a> the 14th of December you folks sat in committee and discuss the tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5189.979s">And</a> I believe, and I could be wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5191.64s">One</a> of the questions that was asked by one of your colleagues Council marked to the assessor as it relates to have you arrived at any kind of a decision regarding the tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5201.606s">at</a> that location 170 Governors Avenue and the assessor responded that they had filed for a tax exempt status. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5210.613s">Conferring</a> upon that and having a brief discussion once again and reaffirming this conversation with Councilor Falco who once again had the same type of concern as related to the assessor's issue of how and what they're going to be taxed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5225.924s">I</a> think she said that it's charitable or something of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5230.193s">So</a> putting that together, and I just went back and just did a little bit of history on this because I was involved in many of the issues on this particular matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5239.915s">On</a> August 28th of 2018, I sent a certified letter to the State Department of Public Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5245.717s">And</a> one of the components of the letter, it was issued, I issued the regard regarding tax exam status, which up until that point in time had not been mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5255.539s">On</a> September 17th of 2018, in the method transcript, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5259.94s">And</a> headline title future of the lots of oil hostile include community input on this say, but in paragraph number 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5266.688s">I</a> like the existing building, it says the ASC will be a for profit and will therefore pay property taxes to the city of method that came right from them themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5277.841s">October</a> 30 2018 and the city council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5281.803s">It</a> was discussed again as to whether the proposed ASC being a builder and the hospital footprint would pay taxes, would it be by the square footage of the whole Lawrence and will hospital footprint itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5295.564s">November</a> 19 2018 at the council meeting, there was a need for an update for clarification for our city of sex office as to how the SC will be determined for tax purposes if approved by the State Department of Public Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5311.068s">Will</a> it be for the whole Lawrence Memorial Campus to be considered as a for profit, or would it be broken down by the square footage of each building separately. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5320.417s">Again,</a> on November 27 of 2019 Susan Sandberg, then CEO and Vice President of Melrose Wakefield Hospital, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5330.106s">appeared</a> before the city council saying for the first time that the AFC will be a for profit business here in the city of method. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5337.372s">Again</a> in November 2018 I sprinted into the method transcript. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5341.776s">The</a> discussion was once again, a for profit business. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5345.699s">December</a> 6 2018, the method transcript said in the proposed commentary period regarding method officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5355.177s">Then</a> in paragraph 13, quote, the proposed method surgery LLC, a joint venture between then named Melrose Wakefield and the Shields Healthcare as being a for-profit taxable ASC. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5368.365s">February</a> 19th, 2019 at a city council meeting, issues were presented as it related to the construction and to the taxing status. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5378.49s">March</a> 19th, 2019, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5381.432s">Melrose</a> Wakefield then notifies the city council and the city that the separate footprint that was going to be at 170 Governors Avenue would now be merged into the property of the Lawrence Memorial Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5393.519s">April</a> 23 2019 the city council meeting, Sue Sandberg said that she was so pleased with the development that have been taking place regarding this proposal taxes will be determined by the city assessor regarding this tax matter, and Michael Max F at the city will be doing a pilot program on the $733,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5415.035s">community</a> health initiative that community health initiative was a planned a planned program for health services within this community and surrounding communities over two to a five year period. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5427.778s">I</a> have not heard one comment by this city, this city administration, or the city assessor's office, as it relates to what is the plan program. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5436.78s">And</a> if in fact it became a pilot program, it was possibly discussed at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5442.021s">May</a> 7 2019 at a committee of the whole meeting once again Council mass ask who, who is going to be paying the taxes on their separate office space, or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5454.591s">The</a> mayor at that time, who was the city council, indicated that she was concerned of a pilot program as it related to just what and how, if we're not going to be getting taxes, if we're going to be involved in a pilot program. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5472.001s">Councilman</a> Fred De La Russa also made comment as he was concerned over how the tax issue was going to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5478.966s">On</a> May 28th, 2019, city council once again <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5483.088s">Vice</a> President Susan Sandberg said the ASC will provide new tax revenue and will provide an additional $750,000 within a two to five year period for additional area services. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5494.854s">She</a> reiterated on May 18, that for which was said on April of that year of the Community Health Service $750,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5503.578s">On</a> June 4, a letter was sent to Susan Sandberg by myself once again, talking about issues as it relates to the taxing issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5511.242s">And</a> then on October 15, 2019, Susan Sandberg reiterated that the ASA will bring tax revenue to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5521.588s">Also,</a> then-Councilor and then-Mayor Brenna Lundgren stated that she wanted the developer to provide for the city of Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5532.12s">a</a> tax, a tax review number one and number two, the vote will take you can say that the vote that the council is taking that the, the, the agreement would go to the petitioner, not to the land. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5550.164s">When</a> they made their proposal before this method city council into the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5556.145s">Their</a> information presentation read as follows in one of their sections. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5561.147s">What</a> benefits will an ASC bring to the city of Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5564.828s">Their</a> response was the ASC will pay local taxes, as well as add jobs in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5572.411s">In</a> addition, as part of the state revenue process, there will be a substantial community benefits contribution, that's the $750,000 I was talking about, to help address the pressing health and social welfare needs of Medford and other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5588.037s">The</a> total amount the ASC will contribute towards community health initiatives is approximately $733,000, and that'll be paid over a two to five year period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5600.053s">From</a> that period of time, from May 7 of 2015, that can be the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5605.894s">And</a> I believe you had at that point in time made reference to Councilor Falco as it relates to that particular meeting, as it relates to how taxes were going to be paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5615.776s">This</a> city council has not been advised, never mind the council, the taxpayers have not been advised as just how and when it's going to take place for taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5625.17s">And</a> how are they going to pay it and when are they going to play it, and what meetings if anything has taken place at that meeting in May of 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5632.497s">I</a> also presented before there before the city assessor communities such as Weymouth, and then the central hospital and what they were doing with their cities and towns in combination of either a and in lieu of taxes or a tax payment to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5649.833s">You</a> have received nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5651.66s">Nothing</a> has come back, Mr. President, as it relates to this particular issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5656.533s">I</a> secured from the Secretary of State and the State Attorney General's Office, there was no filing of any sorts, other than the amendment that they filed in 12-4-2020, which was December 4th, of a change of address. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5672.643s">They</a> had the original address in Boston, and now they changed it to 170. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5677.426s">Now,</a> just because they're built at 170, 170 Governors Avenue, same address as the Lowell Memorial Hospital, where urgent care is there right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5686.112s">There</a> should be no taking advantage of that being a tax exempt nonprofit. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5691.033s">When</a> she was came in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5693.254s">They</a> made it perfectly clear that the linchpin to this deal was that they would pay taxes to the city method on the ASC 16,000 square foot piece of building that they were building for $17,500,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5708.327s">It's</a> a shame that during this budgetary process, when you were setting and addressing your tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5715.429s">Nothing</a> was presented as it relates to the anticipation of approximately any wisdom, five and a half million plus dollars on an annual assessment of that piece of property, what that would bring in for taxes here to the city of medicine. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5731.452s">But</a> before this council gets going again in January next year that this issue is brought to your attention we've heard all kinds of rumors oh yeah they're going to pay, whatever it might have been, you have nothing from the assessor's office in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5744.688s">That's</a> saying number one, they're going to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5747.371s">You</a> don't have anything regarding the community health portion of $755,000, that's going to be paid over to a five year period of time for the health initiatives and concerns that you might have to be brought forward, and that was brought to the state's Department of Public Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5763.216s">When</a> this was all presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5764.277s">This</a> is a real concern that I have I'm very concerned over this because <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5768.638s">That's</a> hundreds and thousands of dollars that potentially could belong to the city of method coffers that could be used, whether it's in our public health department, our schools our budgets police fire, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5778.964s">This</a> is too small of a thought to be issue when in fact it's a big issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5784.547s">And</a> to me it's such a big issue that it hasn't been discussed, I say shame on everyone who knows what that should have been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5792.832s">This</a> should not be a red herring coming up now to say okay why are we talking about we're talking about now because nobody in the city has talked about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5800.439s">And</a> if somebody made a mistake in their commentary that that's it's for profit will then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5806.183s">If</a> it's a for profit, not enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5809.126s">If</a> it is for a for profit business, excuse me, you people should have this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5815.411s">We</a> the taxpayers should have that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5818.577s">I</a> don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5819.258s">Is</a> anyone behind this real received anything.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5836.495s">So</a> let me ask you this, Mr. President, directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5838.617s">You</a> had a conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5839.618s">Do</a> you have anything in writing from them that says that? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5841.159s">If</a> you want something in writing, I will get something in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5843.221s">I</a> think the council deserves it, and I think your tax base and your tax rate deserves it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5847.884s">I</a> will have something in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5849.546s">I</a> would strongly suggest that a council resolution go forward seeking that, and that nailing it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5854.65s">And</a> for further information, Sue Sandberg is no longer with Melrose-Wakefield.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11114.927s">Well,</a> excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11116.728s">I</a> didn't realize you're gonna allow folks from the audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11120.75s">We're</a> here with someone from 1892. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11125.012s">Great</a> service, Mr. Delato, 1892. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11126.632s">He</a> looks the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11128.953s">I</a> don't know what the pill is that he's taking. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11130.574s">It's</a> probably not the blue pill, but that's neither here or there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11134.783s">When</a> I look at these two gentlemen here, I don't know John Falco as well as I do Michael Marx, but I will tell you this, going back to when John Falco was first running for school committee, I met with him and my wife at a restaurant at Mystic Avenue, and he was gracious enough to listen to her concerns being a school teacher as to what possibly could be things that he could bring forward to the school department for which he did. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11158.714s">And</a> I appreciate that and I commend them for taking the opportunity for run for higher office this past year, because it takes an awful lot for someone to give up something that you might have as a security position, which would be a council school committee seat to take the next step forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11173.631s">But</a> if you don't try and never know. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11174.993s">As</a> far as Michael Max goes all I can say. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11180.386s">I</a> wish he was here a little bit longer because I think he probably would have given me the one last incentive to once again run for this August party only for one reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11190.934s">This</a> city is going through a tremendous, like the country, a tremendous amount of change and you do need some level-headed people to understand yesterday, to capitalize what's going to take place for today. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11203.203s">I</a> just hope and wish that this new incoming council can put together <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11209.553s">with</a> the fellows that are here for a few years, some wisdom and common sense that recognizes that we are the city of method, and as an as inclusive as we are, we should not be divisive at the same time, because it cannot work and you cannot sustain itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11226.359s">I</a> thank you, Michael for your years of service your dedication. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11229.722s">But</a> more importantly, I thank your family for allowing you to do it like my family allowed me to do mine for 36 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11236.747s">I</a> appreciate it and I know your folks and your families appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11241.009s">I</a> just hope that the incoming city council grasps the knowledge that needs to be taken to make this city work to go forward and to be able to question <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11251.796s">without</a> having to be called divisive rather than not divisive. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11257.6s">Asking</a> a question to get an answer is the best way to resolve an issue rather than not listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11264.184s">Because</a> I think it was you, John Scott that says, you listen and you listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11268.126s">And</a> the more you listen, the more you can learn. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11271.028s">Merry</a> Christmas, happy, healthy new year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11273.51s">And</a> congratulations, John and Michael. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11276.027s">You're</a> welcome.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_BW-5g1WATfg/2024-11-19_BW-5g1WATfg.html">City Council 10-05-21</a></h2>

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=463.132s">Good</a> evening, my name is Bob Penta, Zero Summit Road, former member of the Sarkis party. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=467.496s">I</a> would respectfully disagree with using the word concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=470.279s">The</a> fact of the matter is that an accident has already taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=472.921s">Tank</a> has already been going down that road and coming up that road. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=476.184s">You</a> have MBTA buses telling you, you have a line from your own traffic consultant that tells you that a fire truck, if has to, can go on the opposite lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=486.073s">You</a> have no idea at what time of day or night that that might be happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=489.436s">The</a> whole idea, I believe, the impetus of the council president's resolution is to let this city administration know that this council is not supportive of this type of islands coming in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=503.304s">You</a> can call it part of the complete streets program, the $563,000 that the city got from the commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=509.888s">Where</a> was the fire chief being consulted on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=512.33s">Where</a> was the city engineer being consulted? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=514.251s">And</a> all these proposed bump outs that are being planned right now, continuing down on High Street, going into the West Medford area, where's the consultation for that? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=523.599s">Just</a> go look at Sagamore Avenue and see the way they want to have that cutout coming out into the middle of High Street and then Boston Avenue over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=531.064s">And</a> then further down, right opposite the Brooks School, there's a gentleman who just did his driveway over and he's got a bump out in front of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=536.308s">It</a> doesn't make any sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=538.49s">I</a> would not change one word in the president's resolution, only for one reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=542.311s">The</a> city administration has to know that you do recognize that this is a safety problem here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=548.192s">This</a> isn't just for cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=549.753s">This</a> is for trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=550.873s">This</a> is for ambulances. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=552.273s">This</a> is for other kinds of vehicles that are heavy duty going down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=556.334s">And</a> we're not talking about a good day, as the council just alluded to on Sunday at 9 o'clock in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=561.795s">The</a> gentleman, unfortunately, didn't see the island. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=564.376s">Not</a> only didn't see the island, he wrecked the whole bottom of the carriage of his car. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=568.738s">What</a> are you going to do in a snowstorm when it's dark out late at night and you have a big heavy tanker going down there? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=575.046s">What</a> are you going to do with a bicycle, a gentleman or a lady driving their bike down there, going in that little lane there, and you have an emergency vehicle trying to get by? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=585.42s">You</a> know, one thing I learned after many years of being on this council is one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=590.962s">If</a> you know you see something that's wrong, why would you want to just smooth it over, use the word of concern as relates to telling the city administration, you're going to continue on with this complete streets program, this traffic calming issue, then the public safety is the priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=608.887s">And</a> right now it's quite obvious that it's not a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=611.547s">Correct</a> me if I'm wrong, Council President, <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=613.828s">Fire</a> Chief said, even though he can get by, he's only got a foot on either side. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=617.818s">Is</a> that what he said?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=653.904s">I</a> would believe that the impetus of the resolution, if you want to get to the concern that Mr. Isaac Beers has introduced, that would be something that they would once again look at to come back, okay, we'll redesign it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=667.652s">But</a> you'd lose your impact by putting the city on notice that you've recognized, you've talked, this is four times in a month, you have discussed this issue and it's not going away. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=679.152s">And</a> the only way it's going to go away is if the city administration is aware of it and whoever their contact is with the state for the purposes of trying to make this correction, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=688.674s">As</a> of this Sunday, the fire chief, as of this Sunday, the fire chief still hasn't been informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=693.175s">So</a> he had to go out there and do his dry run. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=695.555s">Well,</a> how do you call that progress? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=697.916s">How</a> do you call that when somebody is supposed to sit down and let's talk about this traffic calming issue? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=703.837s">How</a> can it be traffic calming when you haven't even spoken to the public safety personnel who it's going to affect? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=710.559s">You</a> know, it isn't like you guys, young lady, are in a tough bind. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=716.882s">It's</a> a very simple resolution that the President has offered. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=723.225s">as</a> the mayor of this community and to your departments, we're putting you on notice because God forbid something happens and somebody gets killed, this council has put the city on notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=733.328s">If</a> not, God forbid something happens and you modify that resolution, you're all gonna be part of a lawsuit. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=740.93s">And</a> then you're gonna have to explain your way out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=743.651s">That's</a> wrong and that shouldn't happen like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=747.454s">I</a> would suggest, Mr. President, that you do not accept the resolution to modify it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=752.939s">Just</a> make it as a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=754.02s">It's</a> not a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=755.001s">It's</a> an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=755.842s">It's</a> a public safety issue that demands its attention one way or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=760.987s">And</a> if they don't want to resolve it, shame on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=763.129s">At</a> least the council's on record explaining the reason why. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=766.172s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=768.034s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=770.837s">Chair</a> recognizes Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1163.281s">Just</a> in response to Council max. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1165.983s">Nobody's</a> asking anything to be redesigned I don't think any of us have that expertise we're aware of that, but nobody came into the city and sat down with the public safety people, as it relates to all these locations that are being promulgated, and whether a review after four months <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1182.35s">I</a> mean, after four weeks talking about this and there's still, there is still no communication with the public safety personnel of this city, which means either one or two things, either the city administration is not listening to the council, the city engineers not listening to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1197.512s">And</a> you have a fire chief who's basically telling you, you might have a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1201.414s">You</a> have a city traffic engineer turns around and tells you, well, if something happens, you can go to the opposite side of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1207.537s">Well,</a> that in and of itself tells you right there, don't talk about public safety when you have a fire truck coming at you on the opposite side of the street, if an emergency exists, or if there's a snowstorm or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1219.06s">The</a> whole idea I believe of the impotence of this whole resolution is to put the city on notice that you're not happy with the island there because it is, it has the potential to cause problems and if it's going to cause problems in an accident for which you've already had one it's already started. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1233.951s">You</a> know, keep us out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1235.793s">We</a> should not be part of any lawsuit by any citizen, city of Medford or other city of Medford, because we told you this was going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1243.402s">Maybe</a> it might be wise, Mr. President, to invite the state in to sit down with the city council and review every one of these locations that they want to put in. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1252.032s">How</a> many accidents have taken place? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1253.833s">This</a> is the reason why we're putting it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1255.774s">Where</a> the bump boats are going and what's the reason for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1258.695s">They</a> made the determination. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1260.236s">They</a> don't live in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1262.016s">They're</a> not the experts for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1265.118s">It's</a> our city engineer and our public safety because if it's going to impede anything that they do on a daily basis, they should be primary before any decision is made. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1275.623s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_SxgiOOMwDHY/2024-11-19_SxgiOOMwDHY.html">City Council 06-08-21</a></h2>

<a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5799.655s">Memorial</a> Day was never intended as a celebration to remind us of the ugliness and the ravages of war, but rather to honor in some solemn observance, our men and women, <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5812.54s">their</a> survivors, and our allied comrades who sacrificed their lives to protect our liberty and our freedoms here at home and around the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5823.785s">Likewise,</a> our Flag Day observance on June 14th is but an annual reminder of some 244 years ago when the Second Continental Congress, along with George Washington, took a break from their writing of the Articles of Confederation to establish a standard bearer <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5842.382s">to</a> be the unifying symbol of our colonial fighting forces and for our freedom. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5850.245s">As</a> our fledgling nation was moving forward in its quest for its independence, that is how Old Glory was commissioned to be our American flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5861.143s">From</a> Memorial Day remembrances of lives given up to protect our America, to the flag day birth of old glory, both symbolizing the embodiment of our right of free speech, we are here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5876.69s">But</a> in the interim of many years, what has happened to our country, state, and local cities and towns nationwide, especially over the past 30 years in particular? <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5890.537s">When</a> the politically correct crowd of progressives and liberals began complaining that our public displays of patriotism is offensive to others, and we have to back off such displays, and that we are a systematically racist country as well as a city, and that we need to practice cancel culture, wokeness, defund the police, teach systematic race theory, and being a white supremacist, <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5919.918s">and</a> accept revisionary history as history's new truth, I take offense to such broad universal commentaries, especially by Washington politicians and self-serving proclaimed educators who have made their living by espousing race as their financial and social calling card for more than the past 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5946.933s">With</a> crime running at an all time high, illegal immigration crossing our borders, causing ongoing social welfare, educational, security, and uncontrollable medical problems, we have now become the victims of today's liberal and progressives agenda of inclusion without requirement or responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5973.209s">Also,</a> if God offends anyone, then I suggest you consider another part of the world as your new home, because our good God is part of our American inheritance of religious freedoms secure from governmental intervention. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5989.062s">And</a> if our American stars and stripes offend you, or you do not like or believe in our Uncle Sam, and you don't have the tolerance for free speech, then you should seriously consider exporting yourself to another country. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6004.392s">In</a> conclusion, <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6006.095s">Our</a> First Amendment gives every citizen the right to express his or her opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6011.277s">But</a> for those who complain, whine, or gripe, or dislike our American way of life, as well as our city of Medford way of life, don't let the door slam you as you leave, because you do have the right and the opportunity to leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6030.162s">We</a> are not a perfect society. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6033.805s">but</a> there is no other country that offers more freedoms than our America. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6039.968s">So</a> from a Memorial Day remembrance to a Flag Day observation, let not our freedom of thought, speech, and expression ever be challenged by some ideology that bears no fruit but hatred, division, and racism. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6059.422s">Thank</a> you and let our method never be a part of any such movement or agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6066.267s">I</a> felt Mr. President and Councilors, I had to say that because after being at the Memorial Day service and listening to our veterans director emotionally present before our community that for which a veteran is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6087.122s">I</a> feel as an American. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6091.823s">I</a> am a white Italian American. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6095.306s">I'm</a> proud of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6096.767s">I</a> am not a racist, and I don't intend to be a racist. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6101.191s">I</a> encompass anyone and everyone who wishes to express their opinion, and I would hope that our city of Medford does not go down any path that disrespects the fact of who we are as individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6115.943s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8028.474s">Robert</a> Penton, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8031.136s">I</a> have some, Mr. President, this is our third time we've had this discussion on this high street project. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8035.527s">at</a> the corner of Woobin and Hastings Lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8039.609s">And</a> I'm a little bit disturbed and recognizing that Mr. Blake, who I've never met, I'm quite sure that he's proficient in what he does, but he makes a comment in his response to you by saying fire trucks may have to use the entire opposite lane to make the turns. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8057.819s">And</a> by doing that, Mr. President, what you are doing, you are exposing the city of Medford to a tremendous amount of liability. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8066.106s">And</a> if the city is going to go forward and leave that island there, then it should be part of the official record here that the Medford City Council does not support, but rather condones the fact that that island can now cause a potential hazard to the city of Medford's liability. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8087.682s">We've</a> spoken to MBTA buses, there's no mention in here on the extra long tankers that carry gas. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8094.305s">The</a> other day coming down high street toward the charter circle, there was a bicyclist there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8101.329s">And</a> you know those trucks once they have that weight, they're moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8105.631s">And</a> he was people in the home because the bike was just taking his time going through that little pathway there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8112.254s">So</a> all I can say is, <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8114.752s">It's</a> there, it's in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8116.914s">And</a> the city council now has enough, if you're really strong in this position, and I think you are, you have an affirmative position to make by way of a vote that the city of Medford, the Medford city council opposes that particular island that's put there because the acknowledgement from your own traffic commissioner says, <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8135.872s">The</a> fire trucks might have to go on the complete opposite lane to make its turn. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8140.835s">What</a> about a car coming the opposite way? <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8143.377s">What</a> about the bump out that's over there? <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8145.058s">What</a> about the second island? <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8147.18s">What</a> about the bump out that's in front of the house, in front of the man's driveway, in front of the Brooks School? <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8153.804s">It</a> makes no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8155.925s">And</a> go further down into West Method on the corner of High Street and Sagamore Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8160.789s">Look</a> what they already have penciled out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8163.571s">It's</a> on to the middle of the street almost. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8166.353s">These</a> aren't traffic calming. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8168.174s">These</a> are traffic accidents just waiting to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8171.115s">And</a> you've got to understand the route traffic and the type of traffic that's on those routes. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8175.958s">I</a> think you brought it up last week, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8178.339s">A</a> truck going up the hill, they've got to pick up the speed to get up the hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8181.86s">Look</a> at the buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8182.741s">What</a> are you going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8184.282s">And</a> right there at that intersection, there's a bump out there, which makes further no sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8189.904s">So</a> I don't know, Mr. Blake. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8191.485s">Like</a> I said, I've never met you and I don't know you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8194.487s">But</a> I don't know how you can put in writing that a firetruck can go in the opposite lane to make its turn if it has to because of an emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8203.774s">You</a> are now indicating that the city is exposing itself to a liability. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8209.659s">And</a> if that's what the state is going to be doing throughout the rest of the city, with these locations, with these prompts, causing problems with side streets because of buses, <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8220.885s">and</a> cars cannot be going down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8222.728s">What</a> are we getting all this money for the state for if the city has no input into providing common sense use of the money? <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8233.145s">It's</a> a damn shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8234.899s">that</a> we have to be discussing, you folks have to be discussing something that common sense tells you by just going there and looking at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8242.545s">And</a> you can paint and stripe the streets all you want with your yellow lines, you're not gonna get rid of those islands. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8248.249s">And</a> you're not going to get rid of the fact that coming up or going down in a winter's day storm, and if there's ice in the road, and if there's an emergency that has to take place, somebody is gonna get killed there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8261.279s">And</a> you already have it now in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8264.18s">Your</a> traffic supervisor has now told you in writing that a fire truck can go on the opposite lane if he can't make the turn. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8272.283s">What</a> does that tell you? <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8273.423s">What</a> does that tell you about the Commonwealth of Massachusetts coming in here trying to tell the city of Metro, we know what's best for your streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8281.166s">Tell</a> them to take their money back and mind their business and let the city of Metro to its engineering department and through citizen input, take each section one at a time to realize what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8294.052s">It's</a> all right for somebody to come in here and tell you what to do, but it isn't all right for you to tell them, possibly you maybe made a mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8303.038s">You</a> haven't thought this out correctly or possibly. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8306.181s">Mr.</a> President, you're the president of this council, the six of you, you make seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8310.804s">I</a> would strongly, I strongly advise and suggest that some one of you, if not all of you put a resolution on <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8318.851s">indicating</a> that you do not, you are against, and you don't accept the fact that that island in the middle of High Street, Reuben, Hastings Lane, serves in the best interest of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8331.656s">If</a> anything, it does not serve in the best interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8334.897s">And</a> you have the letter from your own traffic supervisor who says the same thing, traffic consultant, excuse me.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_JjIkY7Z2rzw/2024-11-19_JjIkY7Z2rzw.html">City Council 06-01-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3856.492s">Good</a> evening, name and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3857.873s">My</a> name is Bob Penta, former member of the Saugus body. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3860.935s">And</a> I would be remiss not to come up here because as a prior member of the Smith City Council, I think it was only on three separate occasions that I had the honor of recognizing a young gentleman who became an Eagle Scout. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3873.745s">Tonight,</a> it's a distinct pleasure because in today's day and age, you don't even hear of the term of an Eagle Scout. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3879.029s">You</a> don't hear about the dedication that a young man would put <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3883.072s">into</a> doing something positive, not only for the community, but for himself, recognizing he needs to be a success for the future because that's what this is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3893.046s">being</a> self-made and going forward, being a graduate of the vocational school, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3897.507s">Going</a> into the electrical department, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3900.048s">Being</a> an electrician, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3902.389s">But</a> the one thing that everyone seems to be missing today about youngsters, whether they're male or females, is the fact that they have this self-worth of wanting to do something that benefits the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3914.512s">And</a> just by looking at him and looking at the six years that it took him and his family that's here, it's a proud moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3921.114s">And</a> not only is it a proud moment, it speaks well for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3925.311s">You</a> don't hear too much about scouts today in the news. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3927.933s">If</a> anything, you may hear some more negative than positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3930.975s">But</a> this gentleman represents the positive part of what our city is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3936.039s">It</a> represents why Medford is what it is, because they have the ingredients, the intelligence, and the drive of a good, young, honest man who wants to make not only his life better, but our city of Medford better. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3949.57s">So</a> like I said, I would be remiss not to come up here and say that because I think this is <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3954.534s">a</a> distinct honor, not only for this gentleman, but also for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3959.317s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6254.491s">My</a> name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass, former member of the Saugus Party. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6259.976s">Last</a> week, we had an interesting conversation that you started, Mr. President, regarding this little bit of an island that supposedly has found its way at the corner of Woburn and High Street and Hastings Lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6271.898s">I</a> spent some time during this past week, once again, speaking to bus drivers, members of our fire department, as it relates to the question that I believe the council asked, and I don't think any of you ever got the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6285.262s">Whose</a> idea was it to authorize, to put that file in there, in the middle of the street? <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6290.924s">And</a> if you can just anticipate as bus drivers do, and as a fire truck would do, in an emergency, snowstorm, whatever it might be, just take one of those big, <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6300.754s">tankers</a> to deliver gas. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6303.175s">And</a> in the wintertime, if in fact they happen to be coming down the street and there's some ice or whatever it might be, what about the bike people where the bike lane no longer exists anymore and it's not to be found? <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6313.94s">And</a> if they ever decide to put that bike lane in the middle of the street in between the two islands that are there, not the single one, the two islands there, you've got a real serious problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6323.344s">So</a> my question to you, Mr. President, is the city engineers still online?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6343.159s">Is</a> he still online? <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6343.959s">Can</a> we ask the question? <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6345.16s">Um,</a> the traffic engineer is not online. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6347.562s">What</a> about the city engineer? <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6348.863s">I'm</a> quite sure an engineering plan has to take place to put that in. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6354.667s">Unfortunately,</a> he's not online. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6356.58s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, they continue to keep going on and doing work. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6360.702s">If</a> you just take a look at the idea, if in case there's an emergency and a fire truck has to make it down that street and make that left-handed turn in a snowstorm, you have a problem just facing you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6372.008s">You've</a> got a bump out coming out there on the corner of Woolman and High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6376.01s">And</a> it's just, how do you allow things like this to happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6380.012s">I'm</a> not saying the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6381.484s">I</a> would hope that the council would make a concerted effort to have the city stop that process and actually go out there and look at it, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6391.513s">That</a> path coming down on the corner of Hastings, you've seen it, we've talked about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6397.939s">That</a> thing is so narrow, it's an accident waiting to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6401.323s">And</a> is that what the city has to do, wait for the accident to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6404.706s">Correct</a> it before that even happens, and the island should be as a matter of fact they're keeping both islands there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6412.235s">Whoever</a> comes up with bad enough going down high street toward West Midland right near opposite the Brooks School, there's a bumper right in front of somebody's house. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6420.9s">It</a> makes no sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6422.621s">Who</a> comes up with these ideas? <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6424.523s">I</a> mean, it would be nice if you want to talk about public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6427.324s">That's</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6427.965s">It</a> would be nice to maybe have the council think about it or have them involved with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6432.667s">And</a> I don't know if these are state people. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6434.389s">I</a> don't know if these are city contractors or if this is the city itself that's doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6438.531s">But</a> between the bump outs and that section right there, right there on the corner of High Street, Hastings Lane and Rubin Street, that is a disaster waiting to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6447.975s">And</a> I would hope this council takes an aggressive action and holds the city accountable and not continue further with that and get rid of that island. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6455.719s">It</a> just makes no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6457.279s">You'd</a> have to be a complete moron not to understand coming down High Street, that road is so narrow, <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6464.658s">Just</a> think of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6466.279s">Both</a> ways, both ways, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6469.08s">Both</a> ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6469.901s">And</a> it's a shame that none of you have gotten an answer back and you asked for that a week ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6474.442s">Public</a> safety and not even an answer.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6517.98s">And</a> you've got the bumper right over there as well.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6521.983s">I'm</a> picking up one other point that Council Marks alluded to, because apparently there's been no updating as to the streets, as the sidewalks being a little bit wider in the bike lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6531.65s">So</a> since none of that has taken place, and you have people coming down High Street in that bike lane, they're going to traverse right into that middle of maybe 8 to 10 feet wide.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6546.586s">I</a> would hope one of you on this council would make a motion to just put a stop in that project to fully have a complete public safety review.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6556.934s">It's</a> up and it can also be taken down.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6610.339s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6611.26s">I</a> thank you for listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6612.543s">I</a> know you've seen it, we've had this discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6615.225s">And</a> again, I would something, hopefully, you know, things are made to be corrected. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6619.407s">That's</a> why there's a racist on pencils. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6620.968s">And</a> that's why sometimes having something like this really be taken a look at in the interest of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6627.111s">I</a> think it makes a lot of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6628.652s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6629.172s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_7dpVBOZN8pE/2024-11-19_7dpVBOZN8pE.html">City Council 05-25-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1961.812s">Robert</a> Penta, Zero Summit Road, former member of the Saugus body. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1965.595s">During</a> this past week, I've had two conversations with two separate bus drivers from the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1970.44s">And</a> their question is, cause I can't answer it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1972.141s">So</a> since you do have the city engineer online, they think this is a complete hasty comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1978.755s">Safety</a> has it as Councilor Caraviello and a few of you alluded to, to having this island that sticks out on the corner of High Street and Woburn. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1986.619s">So</a> since we have the city engineer, could you please answer the question, whose idea was to put that island there? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1993.022s">And</a> did that island come in as an afterthought to this construction project? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1996.944s">Because</a> if that's the case, then I would strongly suggest that you folks recommend that that be removed before someone gets killed here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2005.405s">Can</a> we ask the question, please, to the city engineer?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2055.541s">But</a> with that being said, Mr. President, going back to what Councilor Marks and others have alluded to, the bike lane and the taking a property coming up high street and then getting to that intersection going down the hill, that seems to be have bypassed whatever was supposed to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2070.548s">And</a> you're asking for something now that this council has already voted on and there's been a change. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2076.291s">I</a> get the impression that this council has not been advised of these changes and the bike route. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2082.586s">and</a> the island that went there, because it appears that that island, I mean, you're talking about safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2088.687s">Let's</a> talk about the traffic safety before the, you already have a crosswalk right there at the corner of Hastings Lane going across. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2096.069s">And</a> the island comes out a little bit more, it comes over in the area that's pushed out where, in front of the other island that's already there, that's gonna be gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2103.11s">But</a> you have to take into consideration in the wintertime, buses coming down the street, heavy duty trucks, ambulances that have to get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2110.652s">You're</a> looking at a serious, <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2112.587s">vehicular</a> emergency situation that's going to happen there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2116.991s">So</a> I would strongly suggest that that island can be removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2120.555s">It</a> should be removed.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5900.88s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5902.181s">Mr.</a> President, I'm Bob Pento, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5905.126s">Rick</a> just jogged my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5906.887s">The</a> city has in its Department of Public Works, anytime a street is opened by a public utility, there is a bond that they have to place. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5914.489s">I</a> believe it's gone from five to $10,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5917.63s">I</a> think what really needs to be checked, if you wanna get into this review as Rick suggested, and he's absolutely right, have those bonds been taken out? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5925.393s">Is</a> the city sitting on any kind of money in its legal department or the Department of Public Works? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5930.535s">Because</a> one of the big complaints before when the streets were being dug up by utilities, <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5934.26s">They</a> weren't being put back in the way they were or made better than what they were. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5938.122s">And</a> many streets are like that in the city, national grids coming in, they've done that on numerous occasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5942.844s">So</a> as a result of that, I think it's something that you probably should look into. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5946.405s">Have</a> they filed anything by way of a bond with the city as it relates to this? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5951.267s">And</a> more importantly, when you talk about the residents not getting their fair share out of this whole thing, Councilor Marx is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5958.55s">Because</a> if in that agreement, in that purchase and whatever you want to call it, that agreement between the city and Eversource, it keeps going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5966.716s">And</a> as we know, and I'll ask Councilor Knight, Vice President Knight, if you look at all those additions that they've had since 2015, I guarantee you that the personnel that started this aren't the same personnel that's there right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5980.305s">And</a> if that's the case, that's where the city is losing out. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5983.186s">So</a> that's why you need it hard and fast right up front when the contract is signed, <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5987.714s">Once</a> again, what are they putting up? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5989.034s">Are</a> they putting up a million or two million? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5991.035s">Whatever</a> the contingency might be, but you have it right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5994.076s">You</a> have it already built into the Department of Public Works. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5996.737s">When</a> the public utility comes into the city, they have to place a bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6000.898s">And</a> if they don't place the bond, they don't get their money back as it relates to the work that they've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6006.239s">And</a> there has to be what they call a performance bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6008.857s">And</a> that's the term, performance bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6010.519s">And</a> if that's not in the contract and they are digging up the street and Eversource is in fact utility, then shame on the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6017.245s">But</a> if you do have it, then maybe that $10,000 ought to be increased to a million or two because of the magnitude and the scope of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6024.812s">So</a> thank you, Rick Orlando, you jog my memory.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_8uC6Vq145lQ/2024-11-19_8uC6Vq145lQ.html">City Council 05-11-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2114.637s">Robert</a> Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass, former member of the Saugus party. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2119.404s">My</a> recollection of Harrell goes back to the many times, not only him being a police officer, but the many times he stayed involved in his community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2127.136s">He</a> used to come to these council meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2129.098s">on</a> numerous occasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2130.139s">And</a> if he had an opinion to make, he would make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2132.94s">And</a> he would tell you right to your face what he thought of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2134.881s">That's</a> the same way he acted when he was a police officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2137.983s">If</a> he made an infraction of the law, you were guilty of doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2141.344s">And</a> then if he wanted to give you a break, that would be a separate story. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2144.326s">But</a> the interesting part about Harold is I think he represents what a lot of people try to do to a police officer today. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2153.804s">They</a> try to make them look like a bad person. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2156.706s">They're</a> not out there for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2159.007s">That's</a> the worst message you can send out there right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2162.849s">Harold</a> McGillivray was a policeman's policeman. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2166.611s">And</a> he represents every single policeman that puts that uniform on every day, puts that gun, puts that badge, and goes out there to defend the people of the community that they're in, whether it's city, county, state, or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2181.099s">I</a> would hope that the people of Medford not only appreciate the fact that Harold McGillivray and the family and his two sons, who are also police officers in the city, are going to have their father's name be put on the plaque that represents what law enforcement is in this country. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2198.276s">They're</a> there to help and defend the people, and that's what it should be about. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2203.544s">not</a> to debunk them, but to defend them. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2206.407s">And</a> it's a shame that anyone tries to do anything to take away from the integrity of what a police officer is. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2212.933s">And</a> to Mr. Harold McGillivray, I thank him very much because I enjoyed him and he was a good supporter of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2218.819s">And</a> because of that, I support him as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2221.041s">Thank</a> you.

<a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6787.602s">You</a> know, where are we going as a community and as elected officials? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6791.984s">You</a> know the real sad part about this? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6794.415s">This</a> is gonna be the 30th year in Washington, D.C. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6798.697s">that</a> the veterans have had their annual motorcycle parade. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6801.939s">And</a> it's the first time that it's being canceled. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6805.321s">It's</a> being canceled because allegedly of COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6808.822s">But</a> on the same day, BLM is having their parade and cannabis is having their event on the same day, same times as the schedule for the AMVETS 30th anniversary motorcycle parade. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6823.795s">There's</a> a little bit of a disconnect here and maybe of a political, where do we go and who is in support of who and whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6830.777s">I'll</a> tell you my experience about my free speech being infringed upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6835.758s">There's</a> a group in Method called Method Mass Politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6839.479s">The</a> issue was the Christopher Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6842.06s">Now</a> I expressed my opinion on that page, like I've done on many pages here on the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6848.162s">I've</a> been called every conceivable thing that you can think of on that page. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6853.679s">on</a> that group by members in that group and leaving no expert is out. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6859.662s">Just</a> use your imagination. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6862.783s">That's</a> free speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6865.644s">And</a> if they want to say it, and if they're not going to be scolded because of being the appropriateness of their language, then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6874.108s">But</a> I shouldn't be chastised or anyone else be chastised for going on that page or any other page and expressing your opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6881.571s">Just</a> like Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6882.092s">D'Antonio</a> said, <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6883.4s">just</a> like Councilor Doherty said. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6885.182s">And</a> when you are on a board and a commission of this community, common sense dictates. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6891.248s">Because</a> that's what you're here for, to listen to both sides of whatever the issue might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6896.293s">Common</a> sense dictates. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6897.995s">And</a> unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be working here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6902.88s">You</a> know what I resent the most? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6904.804s">I</a> resent the most when people say, I'm white, I was born privileged, and I have a spoon in my mouth, and I can take advantage of anything, or I have taken advantage of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6916.123s">When</a> I look at all of you, you're all white, okay?

<a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7000.111s">You</a> people should have a committee of the whole meeting with the mayor present to tell you how this money is going to be disseminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7006.933s">In</a> 2007 and 2009, when this country had its economic problems, the monies that were given out back then couldn't compete against the needs that the communities have. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7016.836s">Well,</a> now it's a little bit different. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7019.116s">We're</a> getting $37 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7020.717s">It's</a> a tremendous amount of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7022.937s">But</a> you got to look at some of the things that can be used for. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7025.859s">And</a> to me, the first question is, it's looming right around the corner from all of you in 2029, you've got an approximately $30 million unfunded pension liability that no one still talks about. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7038.248s">Who's</a> gonna pay for that? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7039.209s">How's</a> it gonna be paid? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7040.33s">Is</a> it gonna be included in this money that you're going to be getting? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7043.733s">These</a> are questions you really need to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7046.054s">Also,</a> it talks about paying premium pay for the people who did work during the COVID-19. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7054.24s">Well,</a> how are you going to disseminate that? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7055.861s">Is</a> it going to be first responders? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7057.342s">Is</a> it going to be fire? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7058.142s">Is</a> it going to be police? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7059.583s">Who's</a> it going to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7061.284s">I</a> think you really need to sit down and have this conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7064.766s">Let</a> me ask you, have you people have been notified already that you're getting $37 million or did you just read about it in the paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7072.39s">You</a> know, Mr. President?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7075.072s">You</a> have not received it, but it's okay for transparency, for the patch to have it, but the council not to have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7082.275s">My</a> suggestion strongly to folks, all of you, whether you're sitting here or the two that are sitting home, that you sit down with the mayor and her staff to discuss what that $37,500,000 is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7095.559s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7150.169s">Through</a> the chair, Mr. President, it also indicates that you can get premium pay for essential workers and you can offer additional support. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7156.493s">And</a> you can also, the money can also go into the educational park and the educational park for which a lot of these kids have gone through, they have suffered over the past year for emotional disabilities that kids have been able to suffer. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7168.872s">and</a> we won't get it to the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7170.032s">We'll</a> just leave it like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7172.773s">There</a> is money there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7173.794s">It's</a> broken down. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7174.534s">There's</a> six categories. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7176.235s">I'm</a> not gonna go through all six of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7177.435s">I'm</a> just saying, thank you, Council Vice President Knight, but I think you really need to sit down. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7182.257s">And</a> before you take one vote on this budget coming up, you should know exactly how and when that money's coming in and what it can be used for. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7189.6s">And</a> just as a third point, let's go back to the money that they wanna use to take the $500,000 out of that retained earnings account. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7198.946s">We</a> are well beyond the 10 year, 10 to 12 year minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7203.395s">We're</a> into almost the 15th year. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7205.372s">We</a> have batteries. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7207.033s">Batteries</a> are not calculating properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7209.055s">And</a> that's going to reflect on people's bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7210.997s">And</a> that's going to be, it was 795 abatements.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7217.963s">No,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7219.003s">No,</a> listen, wait a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7220.204s">We're</a> talking about money. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7221.165s">We're</a> coming close to our 10 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7222.586s">I'm</a> sorry, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7223.948s">It</a> does talk about money that can be used for infrastructure and water and sewer and water and sewer.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7230.613s">And</a> water and soil. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7231.735s">This</a> is public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7233.376s">It's</a> my right to say my free speech, and it's my time to say what I want to say, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7239.483s">Okay,</a> that's the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7241.084s">Don't</a> shut somebody off if they're making a point.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7308.401s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7308.962s">Mr.</a> President, with all due respect to the unfunded liability, if you look at the budget for the last four years, it's not been funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7315.843s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_GswFX5Excbs/2024-11-19_GswFX5Excbs.html">City Council 04-27-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4015.304s">Good</a> evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4016.144s">Robert</a> Penta, Zero Summit Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4017.645s">I'm</a> a member of the Society of Sprite. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4019.848s">I</a> want to go back to the December of 2002. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4022.61s">And</a> at that point in time, there was a gentleman by the name of Donald Ouellette, who became the city engineer here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4031.658s">And</a> one of the reasons why he became the new city engineer is because he came from the community of Air Mass, where he instituted a new water metering program. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4042.567s">At</a> the time, Paul Guia was our director of public works. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4046.37s">And</a> in December of 2002, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4048.535s">Mr.</a> Roulette came on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4051.176s">In</a> January 20th of 2003, Councilor Marks and myself at the time were interviewed by the local newspaper for the purposes of the concerns that were out in the neighborhood regarding the water meter and the bills that were going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4067.242s">And</a> at that point in time, information came forward that for the past three years, prior to 2003, there were over 709 abatements <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4077.335s">that</a> were issued by the city of Medford because of faulty water meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4082.259s">Mr.</a> Roulette, when he came in, indicated that the city of Medford's water meters at that time were no more, they should be no more than 10 years of age. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4091.225s">They</a> were 17 years old at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4095.208s">So</a> that began the crusade, so to speak, of figuring out how are we going to change these water meters? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4102.013s">Should</a> we change these water meters? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4103.534s">And</a> when are we going to do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4105.687s">At</a> the time, there was over 15,000 households that had water meters that needed to be changed, as well as 150 large capacity commercial district people, which represented 50% of the water consumption and the use at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4123.961s">Now,</a> in August of 2003, the concerns kept multiplying on the council from residents complaining about their tax bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4134.294s">And</a> October 23rd, in a very rare moment by former Mayor McGlynn, he acknowledged at a public meeting that it was his fault that the meters were not changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4144.72s">And</a> the reason is the concern wasn't as bad as it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4148.502s">And</a> he told the Water and Soil Commission at that point in time that blame me, that was his quote, blame me because they just didn't want to get into the financial obligation of getting into the water meters, not realizing how serious everything was. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4161.809s">And</a> that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4163.279s">because</a> that got itself corrected after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4166.241s">Then</a> on February 17 of 2004, Mayor McGlynn presented before the city council a prelude, a prelude so to speak as to what the water meter sewer count should look like and what do we need to do here to go in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4183.255s">But</a> what he did and what he proposed, which was kind of interesting, he proposed to finance $18,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4189.402s">have</a> the city council vote for $18,000 to do a preliminary review on X amount of homes and X amount of businesses in the city, just to see how bad these water meters were in commercial meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4201.666s">And</a> what they found out was an atrocious, the decision or the results were atrocious, because what came out of all of that, where these meters were running much slower, and as a result of them running much slower, the city was losing a tremendous amount of revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4215.75s">So</a> in October of 2004, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4219.526s">straight</a> down October 19th, the city council voted the appropriation for $4.2 million to put new water meters here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4228.13s">And</a> subsequent to that, the chase goes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4231.272s">At</a> that point in time, and that's back in 2003, at the end of 2003, the city of Medford was losing on a daily basis 189 million gallons of water a day, not getting billed, and their leakage was 113 million gallons a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4248.325s">Those</a> two numbers, and I would hope somebody in the council would pick up on that and make a request as to what our leakage is and loss of revenue from then it is now. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4258.407s">The</a> new water meters that came in, once again, had a 10 year lifespan and the meters on this new meeting system, they had batteries in their battery life, according to their own information that they passed up as a 10 year life. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4275.433s">We've</a> well exceeded a 10 year life on these batteries. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4279.515s">I</a> believe most recently there have been some concerns with people who have gotten their bills and their bills have been higher or lower than expected than what they received in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4291.819s">I</a> really think as the concern is for parking in the city, the concern should equally be as where are we going? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4298.141s">You're</a> sitting on over $5 million in your water and sewer enterprise account. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4302.043s">There</a> needs to be some addressing to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4303.743s">When</a> is it going to take place? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4305.988s">And</a> if it's, if in fact, they're accurate in their information that they submitted and they gave us at the time when the council voted on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4314.633s">I</a> think council Max was the only one on the council at the time when we voted on this, something really needs to be done because you're gonna find yourself right back to where you were before. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4323.879s">If</a> in fact, 10 years is the mandate as their brochure says. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4329.262s">So</a> with that being said, I would hope somewhere along the line, what a 10 year battery and a 10 year life of the meter <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4335.555s">something</a> needs to be looked at because we're going to find ourselves right back into the same problem that we were when they were 17 years of age and you brought in a new person. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4344.78s">Second</a> comment, Mr. President, I think it was three weeks ago when I appeared before here, when they were talking about the 5G situation, I said at that point in time that I believed, I believed, and it's my mistake, I misquoted myself, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4359.93s">I</a> believe that that time that one of the people who happens to be the director of public, what's her name? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4366.774s">Public</a> health at that point in time had voted for some of the passing and not for passing some of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4374.519s">Sort</a> of like split down the middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4376.36s">I</a> want to thank council Max. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4377.641s">I</a> want to compliment him because of his institution of pushing forward the folks that had their place, not have that 5G go in front of their house. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4390.984s">at</a> their last meeting, I think that sets the tempo for people to stand up and say, hey, you can fight the government and you can push them back if you have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4398.83s">They've</a> set the standard now. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4400.832s">And</a> people out there, if you don't want that 5G in front of your house, now's your time to complain because they've already set the trademark. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4406.917s">And</a> the council, I believe the vote was four to nothing on that particular issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4413.262s">Two</a> last comments, and they go like this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4416.125s">The</a> two gentlemen that you just talked about, Tom Kianciano and Bob McGovern, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4420.21s">I</a> think the underlying issue there to their lives are that they were born and bred in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4426.836s">True</a> Medford family folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4429.899s">Something</a> that's very hard to understand today for people who just move in here, who think that even though they've been here for 10 to 15 years, they know Medford like somebody in their family who's lived here their whole life, who's been well respected within the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4445.132s">They</a> both happen to have a Wellington background. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4448.135s">And</a> they both happen to have a big family background, something that's hard to find today and to be respected for and to. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4455.678s">So</a> with that being said, I congratulate you for bringing the issue of dedicating the meeting on their behalf. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4461.581s">And</a> I think it's a true honor. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4463.962s">I</a> think also would be a true honor for this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4466.962s">You're</a> getting ready to deal with your budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4468.483s">It's</a> coming up pretty soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4470.184s">This</a> is a big issue as far as I'm concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4472.144s">If</a> I was running for office right now, I would be running to find out where are and is the money for these meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4479.088s">Do</a> they have to be replaced? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4480.348s">When</a> are they going to be replaced? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4482.129s">And</a> how and where is the money going to be found? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4484.13s">Are</a> they going to take it out of the Water and Sewer Enterprise account or what have you? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4488.712s">This</a> is serious money and this is serious community money. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4492.294s">And</a> let me just leave you with one last thought, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4494.194s">I'd</a> like to ask you a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4495.72s">because</a> I look forward to every Tuesday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4498.002s">You</a> started this about three or four weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4500.324s">I</a> don't hear any more from the director of public health on an update as to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4504.948s">And</a> is there a reason for that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4515.277s">But</a> if I remember correctly, the one week she couldn't come, she gave you a written synopsis. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4519.46s">I</a> haven't heard, I haven't heard anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4521.96s">because</a> people look forward to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4523.22s">So</a> I would just hope maybe, you know, that gets itself reinstituted. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4526.901s">But</a> as far as just getting back real quick on the water meters and the whole idea of the meters, it's going to turn out to be a big issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4534.722s">It's</a> going to be a financial concern for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4536.703s">And</a> I'm quite sure when council Marks and myself at that point in time in 2003, we viewed 709 abatements having been filed because the meters were not cooperating correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4550.485s">And</a> thankfully, Mayor McGlynn finally understood. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4552.527s">And</a> that's the reason why he put the appropriation in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4555.268s">You</a> don't want to get yourself into that position again right now, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4559.111s">I</a> don't think it will serve you any good. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4561.413s">So</a> I have all the records here of everything that took place, how we got to where we got at that point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4568.658s">So</a> I would hope that the council does not find themselves in that same position again. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4572.741s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Speaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4573.642s">You're</a> welcome.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5226.179s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5226.319s">Mr.</a> President, just one quick, Council Marks and Council Falco are both correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5231.94s">The</a> software that the city was supposed to purchase would cost anywhere between 100 and 115,000 at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5238.501s">And</a> they figured that the reason that they would save the money on that is just think about all the abatements that you would not have to service, the people that would have to leave work or whatever it might be to come to a hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5248.242s">And</a> sometimes if they didn't even win on their abatement process, they'd have to take that to the <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5252.853s">district</a> go over and some of them, but Councilor Falco is absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5257.475s">The</a> way the program was sold is you were going to have an abatement. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5261.037s">You</a> were going to have a program with a software. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5263.598s">And</a> if any house spiked irregularly, they would contact the taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5268.301s">It</a> should not be the taxpayer contacting the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5271.342s">And</a> I think that's the key. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5273.764s">That</a> was the key as Councilor Markswell alluded to and Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5277.446s">And</a> it's just, you know, when you say out of sight out of mind, but that's not right either. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5282.689s">It's</a> the biggest, other than doing a public works street or a sidewalk, it's the biggest financial obligation that the city has to its taxpayers as it relates to make sure that the water and sewer system works properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5297.121s">And</a> if it's not working properly and there is something wrong with the infrastructure below the street, below the sidewalk, how's the taxpayer gonna know? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5304.987s">When</a> in fact you're collecting, you're raising the taxes each and every year, you're raising the rates each and every year, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5310.664s">You</a> supposedly have this system and you're still telling the taxpayer, you've got to call city hall to find out what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5317.209s">That</a> doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5318.41s">So</a> I think you get your work cut off.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_6Dwt4KXgHTk/2024-11-19_6Dwt4KXgHTk.html">City Council 04-13-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11502.76s">The</a> mic isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11504.081s">Bob</a> Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11506.782s">Mr.</a> President, I appreciate the fact that this is an ongoing thing, and I want to compliment Councilor Marks <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11512.329s">because</a> speaking throughout the community, he has taken the charge on this particular issue, not to be for or against, but just to bring the awareness and to have some understanding of a communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11523.492s">As</a> I said before, this is a $5 billion G5 undertaking by Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11529.913s">And</a> some two years ago, when they first came into the city and had a discussion on this, they allegedly stated there was 143 locations or 143 polls <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11539.053s">that</a> they had identified here in the city of Medford as to where they were gonna go. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11542.796s">Now,</a> these poles are all owned by National Grid and on National Grid's poles, you have fire, you have police, you have alarm systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11550.541s">They're</a> all pole renters and they pay National Grid to be on those poles. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11556.185s">And</a> by paying National Grid to be on those poles, National Grid is now receiving a financial inducement, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11566.468s">In</a> return, that inducement doesn't find itself anywhere back to the rate payers of National Grid, but all Verizon is doing is getting more and more profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11576.754s">And</a> they're not spending $5 billion just for the sake of having $5 billion to spend, because the subscribers to Verizon plans are gonna pay for that in the long run. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11586.159s">There's</a> been no explanation as between 4G to 5G, whether there's anything medically or substantially different, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11594.226s">that</a> could possibly hurt somebody because of the medical portions of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11598.448s">So</a> the question then becomes, and alluding back to council Marx's comment, if you have the lady who is a board of health director, who sits on this board of four, which makes no sense at all, but who sits on this board of four, you've had 11 votes so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11613.676s">And</a> of those 11 votes, six of them have been against and five of them had been for. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11619.983s">Now,</a> I would strongly suggest that you would ask, some one of you folks, ask a question of why the people voted the way they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11628.165s">Because</a> if you understood last week, there was two young ladies here from a certain part of Medford who was concerned about a poll being in front of their house and the poll being in front of their house, not wanting it there, not knowing what the 5G could admit. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11641.748s">So</a> of the five that got approved as compared to the six that didn't get approved, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11646.181s">Do</a> the six have an argument against the five or does the five have an argument against the six? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11650.363s">Are</a> we going to play what kind of game is this going to turn out to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11653.884s">Who</a> gets it and who doesn't get it? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11655.625s">It's</a> not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11656.966s">But</a> the most important thing that I think is missing here that the mayor of this community, having this committee being sent up should have made some kind of an agreement with Verizon as to what the city of Medford is going to get in return <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11669.793s">for</a> having Verizon come into this city and go from 4G to 5G, because the only one right now that's going to be making all the money up front is going to be National Grid on the poles. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11678.997s">And</a> Verizon in the long run will get this, whether it goes to 5G, 6G, 7G, who knows, that's not the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11684.88s">The</a> fact of the matter is they're here, they were planning for it as of two years ago, whether it's 143 poles or 143 locations, that seems to be the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11694.344s">So</a> if you're going to have this meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11696.345s">this</a> meeting, however this meeting is going to be sent up, what's the logic? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11700.267s">What's</a> the reasoning behind approval and disapproval? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11704.028s">And</a> if the director of public health voted against it, and even if it was because she felt that it wasn't right for the city, then it's not right for the city all the time, not just part of the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11715.913s">And</a> those people that voted for it, as compared to the six times they didn't vote for it, well, what was their logic to it? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11722.569s">And</a> I think it's very important that if they're going to make a decision, and you said there's 11 requirements on there, then those 11 requirements have to be met by all applicants that come, all 42 applicants. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11734.674s">So</a> if that's being said, there's no logic, there's no rhyme or reason right now to the 11 decisions that have been made thus far, six for, six against, and five for. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11744.459s">How</a> do you justify that? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11745.619s">How</a> do you explain to the city that you have this committee of ongoing people with no experts on there <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11752.674s">That</a> doesn't make any sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11754.217s">And</a> when the taxpayers can ask that question, you have this subcommittee that's not even odd number, it's even. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11762.83s">and</a> you're being restricted according to FCC that you can't vote because of any medical concerns, but you have your own director of public health on the committee and she votes against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11774.722s">Well,</a> what's her logic for voting against it? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11777.505s">What</a> are all the other members who voted against it? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11780.348s">What</a> was their logic? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11781.649s">And</a> what was the logic of the five that got approved? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11784.953s">That's</a> important to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11786.795s">because</a> you're going to play playing this game with 40 somewhat applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11790.477s">Some</a> get it, some don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11792.217s">Some</a> streets get it, some don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11794.058s">One</a> house has it, another one doesn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11795.799s">And</a> what are you going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11797.26s">Wind</a> up having a lawsuit between people in the city saying, hey, how can you give it to one and not another? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11802.622s">I</a> didn't want it there, but you let it be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11804.983s">That's</a> a good suggestion you came up with, Councilor Marks, because if somebody wants to come and put a poll in a particular area, then maybe they should <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11812.102s">come</a> in advance, say this is where we'd like to do it, and get a find out, let's find out if people are for it or against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11819.106s">But</a> the one thing you forgot to mention on whether it's Burlington or Cambridge, they've got a committee, they've got a committee that's uniform, either it's for or against, it's not split. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11829.872s">So</a> you're dealing with a subcommittee or whatever you want to call this committee, that's split, you have no professionals, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11836.445s">No</a> medical experts, you definitely don't have any technical experts. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11840.026s">And</a> with that being said, how can anybody trust that whether 5G is better than 4G, medically or otherwise, it doesn't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11848.369s">But</a> this city is allowing a multi-billion dollar corporation to come in and right now, nobody knows if the city of Medford is getting anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11858.172s">Nobody</a> knows if this mayor has made any kind of an agreement with Verizon to come in here and do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11863.354s">And</a> the only ones that are gonna get rich in the long run <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11866.596s">is</a> going to be rising in the long run and national grid up front, and your rates aren't going to go down. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11872.002s">So</a> what have you accomplished? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11873.804s">Or</a> better yet, you've allowed somebody to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11877.067s">This</a> is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11877.728s">You</a> should have this meeting with that subcommittee, with the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11881.852s">with</a> the legal counsel that you have, and you should bring in a medical and you should bring in a legal expert. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11886.257s">Doesn't</a> make any difference if FCC rules and regulations say you can't vote on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11890.14s">You</a> have a determination because if the person that's on the committee is medically entitled with the knowledge to know that the 5Gs <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11898.032s">will</a> not work in behalf of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11899.872s">You</a> can't pick and choose what part of the city you want it to go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11902.893s">It</a> either is or it isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11904.533s">Your</a> technical person will say either it is or it isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11907.454s">You</a> can't go from 4G to 5G. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11909.575s">Where's</a> your expert to tell you what's the difference between the two? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11912.355s">That</a> hasn't even come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11915.216s">Oh,</a> I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11916.176s">That</a> hasn't even come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11918.457s">These</a> are important questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11919.677s">So</a> they've already voted on 11 applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11923.478s">It</a> doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11925.438s">You</a> can't run a professional business on something such as this and then be left out in the cold. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11931.404s">And</a> here are seven of you trying to ask questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11933.806s">You</a> have one city council who took the bull by the horns and the people appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11939.251s">And</a> I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11940.112s">And</a> I think all seven of you appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11942.474s">But</a> the fact of the matter is one simple question. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11946.418s">Who's</a> running the show here, Verizon? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11949.909s">You</a> don't know, they seem to be running the show. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11952.271s">Is</a> it National Grid? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11953.272s">Because</a> it's their poll. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11954.933s">They're</a> allowing to go up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11956.494s">They're</a> allowing renters to go up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11958.836s">You</a> don't have any verification from anybody in the city, from the mayor down, where that transparency is, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11965.121s">It</a> needs to come out, it needs to be found. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11969.524s">And</a> if this continues to go on like this, and you folks know me, and that four member committee just keeps going on, and they make those approvals, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11976.758s">Well,</a> then shame on the people of Medford for electing the administration that has allowed this to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11983.343s">You</a> city council have at least taken your position. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11986.325s">But</a> there's a transparency issue here that needs to come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11989.428s">And</a> it has yet to come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11991.109s">And</a> because of that, somebody is going to have to pay the price for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11994.652s">And</a> hopefully, the 5G doesn't go into neighborhoods where people subsequently medically find out that there was something wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12002.691s">You</a> don't want to find yourself into like a Johnson and Johnson situation that just came up now with the federal government because people now have a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12010.335s">There's</a> been some bad reactions to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12012.396s">Does</a> that mean that they're all bad? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12013.677s">No,</a> it doesn't mean that they're all that they're bad, but you've got plenty of time to test this thing out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12017.999s">If</a> they've been here two years ago, since 2019 and saying that we're going to have 143 locations, and this is now 2021, something is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12027.524s">If</a> there's been no situation, no communication, I would respectfully ask that one of you <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12032.851s">ask</a> the city administration, the mayor's office, what, if anything, is the city of Medford going to get, or is the city of Medford getting, by allowing Verizon to come in and put 5G on these poles? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12045.603s">It's</a> a money matter, follow the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12047.605s">It's</a> all about money, as we all know. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12050.007s">$5</a> billion is not chump change. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12052.469s">It's</a> a huge investment nationwide. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12054.972s">And</a> when T-Mobile can rent off the same pole <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12058.922s">that</a> Verizon is putting up, you know, they're all making money. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12063.545s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_0CWldZ_RYd4/2024-11-19_0CWldZ_RYd4.html">City Council 04-06-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=6521.308s">Mr.</a> President, I would like to, if the young lady felt insulted, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=6527.232s">But</a> that's the marketing that Verizon does when they go out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=6530.955s">They</a> go to the lowest socioeconomic areas because that's the ones that they feel that they can move into first. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=6538.62s">That's</a> what I said.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_ilBXW43EmQ8/2024-11-19_ilBXW43EmQ8.html">City Council 03-30-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4027.53s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4028.17s">As</a> a matter of fact, Mr. President, I'm picking up on your resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4032.483s">that</a> took place in 2016, because at that time it was the second year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4037.987s">And</a> I believe along with you and Councilor Knight and then Councilor Brianna Longo, there was some concerns with Park Method and their distribution of how the revenue was going to be coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4049.214s">Therefore,</a> as a result of that, what we needed to go to, as I indicated back then, was to go to the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4057.079s">And</a> in the contract on page five, there is two specific sections. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4060.921s">It</a> basically includes <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4062.722s">that</a> states 20 days after the end of each month, a monthly report would be submitted to the city of Medford as it relates to a whole host of issues relative to the inventory of monies taken in and what's going out and what the fees and everything were. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4078.631s">Also,</a> there's an inclusion in there that the operator, meaning Park Method, would agree to submit on an annual basis the gross revenue and the operating expenses <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4088.74s">So</a> on an annual basis, so rather than having you go and get all the monthly things, I'm requesting that the council puts a resolution forward, making that request as it relates to their annual revenue, relative to the fact that this is what took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4105.126s">For</a> example, you would have net city parking revenue, that's annual appeals, the annual appeal, dismissal, forgiveness, annual resident visitor parking permits, business permits, <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4118.592s">commuter</a> permits, annual parking citations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4122.074s">And</a> then we get to the issue on an annual basis of the $50,000 annually that would go to the commercial districts here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4134.08s">Now</a> that was something that came up by Mayor McGlynn in, I believe, October of 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4139.923s">And</a> as a result of that, that became a bone of consternation between <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4146.513s">the</a> Medford Chamber of Commerce and the business people, and as well as the issue on the city council relative toward the business districts not getting X amount of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4157.182s">Therefore,</a> as a result of that, what took place was that in October of that year, the city at that time through Mayor McGlynn, and then Park Medford came to a final resolution before January of 2015, <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4173.491s">and</a> 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4175.412s">And</a> in 2015, that $50,000 for each square was then included as part of the agreement between Park Method and the City of Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4184.458s">And</a> in their brochure, they note specifically that $250,000 annually will be subject to the appropriation for district improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4193.243s">Now,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4194.269s">I</a> don't know where that money is, if it's ever gone there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4197.311s">Some</a> people say it's gone out once. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4199.392s">Some</a> people say maybe it has, maybe it hasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4201.753s">I</a> don't know, I can't answer that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4203.354s">That's</a> the reason why I'm asking for this breakdown and how the money was being expended. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4209.637s">Next,</a> we have the issue relative toward $2 million a year is what Park Method said that they would bring in annually to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4220.623s">So</a> if we look at that $2 million per year, <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4223.996s">And</a> in the contract, there was an inclusion that anything over $1,250,000 annually, the city would increase from its annual 35% net revenues to 83%. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4235.479s">The</a> question then becomes where, and if in fact, has Park Method submitted that type of information to the city of Metro? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4243.702s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4244.162s">None</a> of us know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4245.823s">And</a> again, once again, that's the reason why I'm here asking you folks to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4250.902s">So</a> then let's go to the issue that basically talks about, I think it was in October during a city council strike that award six committee candidates on October of 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4263.351s">Then</a> council Longo addressed the community at that point in time as it related to the method parking program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4271.838s">Quote,</a> this is what she said, as to parking enforcement, it is broken. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4276.86s">If</a> elected, I will end the contract that expires during the next mayoral term. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4281.824s">I</a> will go back to the committee recommendations of 2009 to implement in-house enforcement and replace the kiosks with meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4290.35s">I</a> will provide free parking for our seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4293.532s">The</a> city will benefit by keeping 100% of the gross revenue for our city services and schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4299.036s">We</a> currently see only 35% of the revenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4302.577s">Now,</a> that's a tough point right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4304.759s">35%</a> of the revenues, because we really don't know because you've never received the public documentation back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4309.944s">You,</a> Mr. President, have asked three times. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4313.047s">Resolutions</a> go back and suggest that and prove that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4316.67s">So</a> where do we go from there? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4318.752s">That's</a> the question of why I think you really need to know how much money has come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4324.386s">How</a> has park method delivered as they're supposed to occur, so into the contract and the city of Medford, how they made an accounting for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4331.451s">It's</a> public information, it needs to be made public. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4334.213s">So</a> the question then becomes, if in fact the contract has been adhered to, and if in fact revenues have exceeded that for which the 35% formula has taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4348.484s">But</a> the question then becomes, if it hasn't taken place, <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4352.346s">then</a> where are those revenues? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4355.228s">There's</a> also a report that's out that you can go on Google and it's by the Method Parking Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4362.454s">And</a> they have a report that goes out there that basically says, through their Google webpage, that on an annual basis, the city of Medford is, if you add up their numbers, that the city of Medford has only collected approximately $436,000 per year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4377.567s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4381.485s">Number</a> two, the statistics that the city has in the city of Medford allegedly will substantiate that we're only getting 35% rather than the 83%, which would indicate we haven't exceeded that for which you would get the $1.3 million annual money that they collected. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4400.822s">But</a> according to Park Medford, when they first came in, they said that their annual revenue would be in excess of $2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4406.243s">So</a> $2 million over a period of 20 years, or even over a period of eight years, would give you $16 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4411.845s">We're</a> nowhere, we're nowhere near that type of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4415.286s">So</a> I would strongly suggest that if this be the case, what really needs to be addressed is as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4421.848s">We</a> have the 2009 report to which Council Marks served on there with the then former Chief of Police Sacco and a whole list of other folks who made up an extensive and an exhaustive report. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4434.952s">as</a> to how much they went to other communities, they checked it out, they saw how the revenues could come in and where it should go in here for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4442.935s">The</a> question then becomes Mr. President, if elected means she has been elected. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4447.837s">So</a> since the mayor has now been elected, the question then becomes the 35%. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4452.899s">We</a> really need to get these numbers to find out, are we in the 35% or are we above the 35%? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4458.702s">And</a> lastly, just let me say this, and this is really the perplexing question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4463.063s">If</a> in fact we follow what the mayor <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4465.424s">Then</a> city council said in October of 2019, to follow that formula of this report, why then do we have another new committee report of people? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4477.326s">Is</a> the mayor going to change plans, change direction, not follow the 2009 report? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4483.107s">I</a> think you people really need to know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4484.807s">And</a> if people are sitting on that committee and it's gonna be a waste of time because you're just gonna follow the exhausted committee report of 2009, that needs to be relegated out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4494.534s">You</a> know, this is a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4497.116s">And</a> if we're only looking at $436,000 a year as compared to a lot more than that, because we haven't gotten to the $2 million mark per year, you need to know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4506.824s">And</a> you really need to have a discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4508.865s">And</a> it was you then Councilor, Mr. President and Councilor Knight and Councilor Marks and Councilor Brianna Longo-Cunningham had serious questions with Park Method over this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4518.962s">You</a> indicated, Mr. President, that this is year eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4521.905s">This</a> is years eight, nine, and 10 are the years for negotiation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4525.688s">And</a> they're taking them one year at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4527.469s">Well,</a> if they're taking them one year at a time, and the mayor said, and when she ran for mayor, that she was going back and she was going to get rid of Park Method, then the plan ought to be that Park Method's going to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4538.559s">There</a> should be no negotiation to extend anything here.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4557.293s">I</a> believe this is the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4558.713s">I</a> may have the wrong terminology. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4559.973s">This</a> is the committee to discuss parking in the city of Medford.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4604.457s">So</a> then the question that I asked the council and to you, Mr. President, if the mayor indicated she was going to look at the 2009, she was going to adhere to that report, then the traffic, this new committee that's been put together, are they discussing this report to add or subtract? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4619.46s">Is</a> the mayor not going to support this? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4621.82s">Are</a> she going to entertain another type of situation? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4624.441s">Because</a> this is very conflicting.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4630.427s">Well,</a> if you're going to be on one year renewals in years eight, nine, and 10, give you the option to bow out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4635.689s">And</a> you've had plenty of time to realize coming into your option year that something should be taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4641.332s">So</a> are we going to, as a community, take three years in a row as option years and work at it one at a time? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4648.355s">I</a> mean, you know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4703.148s">Mr.</a> President, I'd like to answer that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4704.83s">A</a> constant night brings up a good point that three years when it first came up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4709.031s">was</a> nixed by then city solicitor Mark Romney. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4711.992s">He</a> said it would not serve in the best financial interest of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4716.074s">That</a> bumped up the contract to 10 years, but given years eight, nine, and 10, the flexibility, whether you'd want to renegotiate, get out or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4725.237s">I'm</a> only concerned over the fact that you, Mr. President, dating back at least three times going back to 2016, coming forward with council resolution have asked for these numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4735.325s">Senior</a> citizens have been waiting to park for nothing for free, because that's what was alleged. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4740.106s">Same</a> comment was made in Inauguration Day, same comment was made in 2009. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4745.708s">So</a> if we're not going to follow this report of 2009, which is very extensive, and it wasn't just for the city of Medford, you can correct me Councilor Marks, you went to other cities and towns, you saw how they derived their revenue through meters and their timing, and whether they had resident parking, commuter parking, this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4764.068s">If</a> that is not going to really be entertained, I just think that this parking commission, Councilor Scott Bell, it's just a waste of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4771.624s">We</a> either follow something or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4773.964s">Are</a> you going to change it? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4774.965s">And</a> I think the mayor has an obligation to tell you and the taxpayers of this community, whether in fact we're going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4781.546s">Why</a> would you want to go into two more years of one year contracts trying to figure out what you're going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4786.967s">You</a> should know by now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4788.567s">Resolutions</a> dating back to 2016 and 17 with her name and many councilors names on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4794.189s">Question,</a> just as councilor Knight has indicated, the veracity of this contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4799.33s">I</a> mean, how is it going to work with the city of Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4802.429s">Approximately</a> $2 million in uncollected money is still outstanding again. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4808.26s">This</a> is on the Google page of the Medford Parking Commission.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4825.294s">Councilor</a> President, I'm going to disagree with you, because when this council issue came up before the council, it started in May of 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4831.479s">And</a> it ran on for a few months. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4833.861s">While</a> the mayor and some of the councilors had a difference of opinion, <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4836.463s">It</a> did go on, there was some public interaction. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4839.305s">And</a> if this mayor is going to entertain a new contract without having the council interaction and public awareness and public input, that's bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4847.729s">This</a> is really bad because that's not what you call transparency.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5137.58s">Mr.</a> President, one quick thing.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5142.001s">Councilor</a> Marks, you talked about Everett, talked about Revere, talked about Somerville, you talked about Boston, Brookline, Malden, and Everett. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5152.483s">A</a> thorough report from the hiring of a clerk to the amount of people that walked the streets and the monies that were collected. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5158.605s">You're</a> not gonna get more of a thorough report than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5160.705s">And</a> this new commission, for whatever the reason is, it's out there and why the mayor is doing it, <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5165.505s">And</a> nobody knows, but that question ought to be asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5168.166s">If</a> you made the commitment in 2019 to do with this one, why are you going in a different direction? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5173.489s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5174.59s">Mr.</a> President, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5178.432s">Council</a> member.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_DEN45jLIzGE/2024-11-19_DEN45jLIzGE.html">City Council 03-16-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2496.042s">My</a> name is Robert Pentez, Zero Summit Road, Method Nest. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2500.766s">And</a> I think what I have on the agenda is a discussion of Method's pay to park program. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2508.811s">And</a> I believe you gave me the catalyst to do this, Mr. Caraviello, Council President, because for some years you've asked for a report <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2517.686s">and</a> we really haven't gotten a report. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2519.687s">I</a> don't know if you can hear me on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2521.848s">Is</a> this coming through?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2524.609s">You</a> can hear me, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2526.029s">Okay,</a> I'd like to go back to, as a quick side note, to September of 2009, when then Mayor McGlynn had a commission set up as it relates to how was parking going to be addressed in the city because it was a revenue item here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2543.276s">At</a> that point in time, Councilor Marks served on that committee <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2547.489s">And</a> one of their recommendations was to possibly look into having a civilian parking commission in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2554.194s">Now</a> that was in 2009. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2557.075s">And</a> it didn't take place until I believe it started in May of 2014, when then Mayor McGlynn decided we were going to do something about parking here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2568.983s">And</a> as a result of that, from the months of May through the months of December of 2014, we went through <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2576.884s">an</a> arduous task of reviewing how and what packing was going to be here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2583.887s">So</a> what I'm asking for is that a complete breakdown from inception, starting from calendar year 2015, right up to date, be brought forward, and I'm going to pass out something for all you councillors at the end, that we get so not only the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2600.995s">councillors,</a> but we as citizens have an idea of just how much money that's coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2607.058s">Asking</a> for a complete itemized detail is found in the contract that was signed by the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2614.462s">And</a> at that point in time, the public parking point, I believe has been resold. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2619.425s">And</a> it states on page five on section six on the gross revenue, it says within 20 days after the end of each month, the operator shall provide to the city a statement showing all revenue, including details <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2633.742s">of</a> citation revenue, meter revenue, permit revenue, and other revenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2638.225s">And</a> this statement must include a copy of the monthly statement from the separate bank accounts utilized by the operator for the payments and received by the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2647.97s">So</a> I'm really not asking for anything other than what should be in this building right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2653.073s">But</a> the only thing that this building has been able to afford was in the calendar year 2015 and the calendar year 2016, the first report <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2663.213s">that</a> the then city council asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2665.895s">And</a> subsequent to that, nothing has come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2668.496s">I</a> believe you have asked three times, Mr. President for a report, an itemized report for which the contract says they were obligated to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2676.962s">So</a> we're not asking for anything that's outrageous. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2678.963s">It's</a> in this building somewhere, somehow. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2682.245s">Now,</a> another thing you need to remember is they said, they meaning Republic at the time, they said that the revenues coming into the city of Medford would be approximately $2 million per year. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2693.844s">So</a> right now we're into the end of the seventh year. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2696.586s">So</a> that would be approximately $14 million thereabouts to be accounted for according to their terms as it relates to what the revenues would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2706.215s">But</a> if you go on the Medford Parking Commission, they have a Google page here from the city of Medford and they extrapolated from Park Medford, a list of outstanding monies that have owned this old, the city of Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2722.214s">since</a> 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2722.534s">In</a> 2015, still owed, if I'm reading it correctly, it's $339,449. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2725.377s">In</a> 2016, it's $368,140. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2725.697s">In</a> 2017, it's $375,611. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2726.157s">2018,</a> it's $351,470. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2726.518s">2019,</a> it's $339,449. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2751.378s">$148</a> and past year 2020 was $163,875. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2758.441s">Again,</a> if I'm reading this correctly, but I'm standing here tonight to be corrected if I'm wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2763.143s">But</a> from reading what Park Method has submitted and what the Method Parking Commission is saying, that's $1,937,693. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2771.947s">That's</a> outstanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2772.967s">That's</a> still owed here to the city of Medford.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2780.612s">He's</a> a random.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2789.755s">These</a> amounts have yet to be accounted for as being satisfied.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2798.498s">Well,</a> I'm just telling you with the traffic commission, parking commission, excuse me, it's put on their webpage. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2805.1s">But</a> again, as I said, I stand here to be corrected. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2807.901s">Plus</a> the fact, plus the fact I believe <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2811.574s">the</a> $2 million per year that was indicated was part of what park, I mean, Republic Parking said on October, 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2822.639s">So</a> if we look and if these numbers are true, there's a little bit of a problem there, why they haven't been collected upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2831.024s">But</a> therefore, if we're getting $2 million a year for the last seven years, that's $14 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2837.372s">years</a> eight, nine, and 10, I believe are they're renegotiating yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2840.273s">So</a> I really don't know if the city's renegotiating. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2842.874s">I</a> know they have a new traffic commission, a group of people looking at where you should go and how you're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2848.416s">And</a> I think you guys and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2850.997s">Morell,</a> you should be up to date as it relates to, you know, what the city is doing with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2856.259s">Another</a> thing is there is, and I believe- Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2863.481s">It</a> was an October- What information council members?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2888.475s">Being</a> aware of the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2889.396s">So</a> if in fact these numbers are any way correct, that's $1,937,000 takes back to 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2896.071s">there's</a> something wrong with the city not being able to get that money, separate issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2900.634s">Taking</a> that one step forward, in October of 2014, for those of you that might remember, there was the argument of the five squares, Medford Square being one, would get on an annual basis $50,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2913.084s">And</a> that was a ball of contention, especially here in the city of Medford, Chamber of Commerce, and then Mayor Mike McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2919.268s">But</a> toward the end of the year, I believe it was in December of 2014, there was an agreement reached <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2925.923s">There</a> was an agreement reached with Park Method as it relates to, they now, they would be willing to submit $250,000 would be earmarked. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2937.188s">$250,000</a> would be earmarked on an annual basis, 50,000 for each square. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2940.85s">They</a> put that in their folder, in their folder that they passed out, which specifically states that $250,000 annually be subject to appropriation for the district improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2953.375s">That's</a> the five districts here in the city of Metro. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2955.69s">I</a> know it's been some conversation with the chamber, and I know it's been asked a couple of times, but if that'd be the case, that $50,000 a year going forward for four of the last five years would be approximately $200,000 each square that they haven't seen. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2972.333s">Again,</a> the accounting of the money, this goes back to like last week on the water money, on the fees, there has to be an accounting where it's going, how it's being spent, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2983.543s">So</a> if you take that, put that all together, Mr. President, Mr. Messenger, could you please pass this up? <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2990.124s">I'm</a> asking on this particular issue here. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2997.525s">I</a> think it's important to know that while you might be having a commission or a committee to be looking at the parking revenues, there doesn't seem to be anything going forward because it states on page six, I believe, of the contract <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3013.588s">that</a> this has to be a renegotiating year with the people that we have in the city right now, years eight, nine, and 10, is the city in fact in a negotiation with the parking company?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3031.06s">You're</a> on a one year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3032.2s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3032.941s">So</a> for example, if we're on a one year contract, which is year eight, which we're on right now, it's possible at any point in time, this contract ends at the end of this year.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3044.375s">So</a> it's up to the administration that that be the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3046.996s">I</a> would thank Mr. President if in fact that the two million dollars was the estimated amount that we would be getting on an annual basis and we're looking at 1.9 million plus and monies that are owed. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3058.563s">Something's</a> not jiving here because those monies whether they're making the two million dollars a year or not <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3065.555s">How</a> do you let each and every year, how do you let that just continue to escalate and escalate and escalate? <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3070.518s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3071.298s">It's</a> unfair to the people who pay every single day to use the meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3076.08s">And</a> it's unfair as to the contract as it's written. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3079.942s">So</a> it's either a lack of enforcement or I'm reading these numbers wrong, or there's something wrong on the adding and subtracting of how this money's being spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3089.827s">What</a> you have here, what I gave you comes right out of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3094.49s">The</a> contract is even more specific and more definitive as to what you're looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3099.571s">That,</a> as it's written, tells you basically how much money is coming in and where's the majority of it going. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3105.233s">The</a> key point to all of this is whether you stay with the company you have now or you go with a new company, you have an in-house, something has to be considered as it relates to outstanding liabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3117.755s">And</a> you can't run $1,900,000 in an ongoing liability that started from day one. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3125.319s">It</a> just doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3127.3s">So</a> I would hope that somebody would make a resolution and ask for an annual breakdown of Park Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3135.544s">I</a> mean, what the contract says does for the city.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3143.429s">Say</a> it again.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3145.57s">Well,</a> that's what I'm asking.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3458.763s">Back</a> in May of 2017, what was presented here before the city of Medford was a new, what they call a base, <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3467.498s">rate</a> of 861 per household. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3470.979s">And</a> then the different charge would be for the commercial district folks here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3478.622s">And</a> then one of the arguments was that it would raise $1 million a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3483.384s">That</a> was approximately 4% of what the city's budget was at that point in time required for the water and sewer services in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3491.807s">Subsequent</a> to that, it's gone on for the last three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3496.0s">now</a> coming into its fourth fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3498.821s">And</a> I believe a response that was sent back to the city, you folks, pursuant to a request from one of your colleagues, was a breakdown of how much money each and every one of the last three fiscal years amounted to. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3513.945s">Inclusive</a> of that amount, again, was the term of $1 million to be used per year, but they never reached the $1 million per year. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3524.563s">What</a> was reached was $2,585,362.66 as compared to the $3 million that was allegedly stated that the city would gain. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3538.411s">That's</a> a difference of $414,637. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3539.612s">So</a> where do we go with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3544.875s">Where</a> we go with that, the argument was that that would be used to supplement water and sewer for whatever needs might be if something were to come up <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3554.937s">also</a> to subsidize the water and sewer department in case of something that's anticipated. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3561.501s">In</a> the letter that came back, it indicated here that the universal connectivity fee is an infrastructure recovery charge to be hooked into and maintained in the water and sewer system. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3574.349s">The</a> fixed base connectivity fee is estimated at $1 million per year to help stabilize revenues in this place. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3584.439s">That</a> response also indicated that that money goes to your water and sewer account. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3590.161s">There</a> is no breakdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3592.182s">There</a> is no breakdown to the charges, commercial or residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3597.084s">There</a> is no breakdown also as to how and where that money has been spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3602.127s">And</a> there is no program that is set up presently that tells you what that money can be used for. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3608.149s">So</a> right now, all it's done has been included into your water and sewer account. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3612.957s">One</a> of the misnomers to this whole project, when sold back in 2017, was in case there is a, in case, that's the word, in case there is a deficit in either the water or sewer account. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3625.904s">In</a> the years 2016 and 17, there were deficits on the sewer side, not the water side. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3632.428s">But</a> each and every year, when the water and sewer budget is estimated, it's estimated on what the work is going to be here in the city of Medford, and also, <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3640.852s">The</a> water and the sewer rates that you get from the MWRA, those rates come in ahead of time, not after a budget is made and set. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3648.896s">That's</a> another misnomer as it relates to the full program. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3652.118s">So</a> approximately right now, you're sitting on $2,585,000 of base rate fees or charges, whatever the term you want to use, that has come from the Mr. and Mrs. Metro taxpayer has been put into the general revenues of your water and sewer account. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3671.14s">That</a> ladies and gentlemen is not the proper accounting practices and procedures because in your own water and sewer account, you have to have it broken down. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3681.064s">You</a> have it broken down by employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3683.185s">You</a> have it broken down by cost of material. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3685.586s">You</a> have it broken down by the named individuals in the trucks and everything else that goes along with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3691.309s">My</a> suggestion to you folks would be simply this. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3695.231s">You</a> can't put a fee on somebody or a charge <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3698.987s">without</a> knowing what you're charging them for. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3702.228s">It's</a> not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3703.429s">If</a> that's the case, you should have just raised the water and sewer account by the approximate 4% that you think it was going to do to offset it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3711.031s">So</a> if you're sitting on a surplus of approximately $7 million or thereabouts in your water and sewer enterprise account, and you're sitting on approximately having already raised $2.5 million, but you still don't know how it was spent, where it was gonna go, <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3727.116s">Where</a> is the projected projects that are supposed to come? <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3730.238s">It</a> doesn't make any sense because right now, what it's saying is it's a water and sewage charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3735.881s">It</a> was to services in case something were to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3740.984s">The</a> original proposal back in 2017 was the charge for the water meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3746.607s">And</a> that was the charge that was going to be placed on each and every residential person. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3751.27s">So</a> we know right now that that charge every single time, once it comes out, <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3756.162s">is</a> not for the meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3757.642s">But</a> unfortunately, for accounting purposes, because you can't figure it out, in this city, in the accounting department, there is nothing to be found that'll tell you how and where that money was spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3769.145s">But</a> you can find it in water and sewer, in their particular budgets, independently separated. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3774.806s">My</a> suggestion would be to you, that you have a budget coming up this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3779.067s">I</a> would hope that maybe somebody would make a request and ask the question, because it doesn't make any sense <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3784.759s">that</a> the response that came back from the finance director, we don't keep an accounting. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3789.882s">Well,</a> if you don't keep an accounting, how do you keep an accounting of residential and commercial meters that you have and what you're going to be charged? <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3799.367s">How</a> can you allege that you're going to be taking in a million dollars a year when you haven't even got to that figure? <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3806.171s">Something</a> needs to be said as it relates to these type of budgetary items. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3810.813s">Seven</a> weeks ago, I came in here and I think I explained something like seven items. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3814.81s">I'm</a> going to go through them all one at a time, not tonight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3818.232s">I</a> will go through them all one at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3820.374s">Because</a> good accounting procedures tells you what comes in has got to go out and how does it go out. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3827.579s">You've</a> got situations here that you really don't know why should you be charging these people to supplement or augment a water and sewer account that's presently sitting in millions of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3838.106s">You</a> have yet to be told what the cost is going to be for an anticipated construction <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3843.756s">sidewalk,</a> street reconstruction might be because of water and sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3848.278s">So</a> if you keep taking in these monies from Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer, you're overcharging them. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3854.061s">You're</a> overcharging them each and every year on this base rate, the speed, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3859.123s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3904.033s">Well,</a> while that may be true, there's also, you talk about general accounting practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3908.295s">General</a> accounting practices does state that if you are going to put a budgetary item on a budget, as you councilors get each and every year, the question needs to be asked, if I'm going to just put $100 million, so to speak, and put it into a line item, and there's no accounting of the money, other than the fact I just put it into an account, what's the purpose of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3929.019s">So</a> you're right, it's an administrative prerogative, but when it came up in May of 2017, it was contentiously argued at this Medford City Council as to why we need this new fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3940.91s">And</a> at that point in time, the argument was for the purposes of the meters, for the accounting of the meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3947.015s">Now</a> it's going into the general revenue, and now we're being told that there is no delineation, there's no explanation, there's no accounting of how that money's being spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3955.202s">So</a> if that's the case, <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3956.607s">And</a> as Councilors, if there's no explanation of how it's being spent, before you used to have the accounting firm of Melanson and Heath, you don't have them anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3964.609s">You</a> have them for like 15 years out of New Hampshire. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3966.809s">You</a> have a new accounting company that comes in here, they're supposed to do an annual audit. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3970.73s">That</a> question ought to come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3972.05s">Because</a> if you remember correctly, if you looked at the Melanson and Heath audits, that was one of their concerns on the MWRA, especially in our water and sewer accounts, if you go back and read them, the accounting and the prioritizing how the money is spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3985.946s">This</a> account, or this money, Councilor Knight, there's no accounting with the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3990.329s">It</a> just goes into a general revenue.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4003.38s">As</a> watchdogs of the city's money, over and beyond the administration, the administration can make a proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4008.924s">The</a> bottom line is here with the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4010.325s">You</a> either vote it up or you vote it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4012.187s">And</a> if you're going to vote it up or you're going to vote it down, <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4014.161s">The</a> question is, what are you voting on? <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4016.222s">And</a> if something comes to your attention to be questioned as to why and how, this is where it's going to take place in the Medford City Council Chambers.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4038.148s">Then</a> I would respectfully suggest, if we follow that train of thought, I would respectfully suggest a freedom of information <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4044.3s">request</a> to the city auditor, asking the city auditor. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4050.681s">As</a> to why, Mr. President, why there is no accounting. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4056.362s">When</a> you get the money from the MWRA ahead of time, before a budget is made, there's an accounting of how that money is going to be spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4063.964s">You</a> have money.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4073.166s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Biss. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4074.577s">I</a> believe, Mr. President, a Freedom of Information Act can come from anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4078.579s">And</a> if the council does not get it as you got it from the response from the finance person, then you would go to that next group. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4086.182s">Because</a> again, if you follow what Councilor Neider said, if allegedly it comes from the Water and Soil Commission, it's their call, maybe their call to implement it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4093.805s">But</a> it's your call to decide how and where, if it's going to be spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4097.727s">And</a> you guys can ask for an accounting of how the money is being spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4103.81s">That's</a> it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4104.807s">You're</a> more than happy to answer the questions because it's the finances of our community and you can't keep tagging on to Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer and now not having an answer or an explanation.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4484.852s">Mr.</a> President, just on that matter, just to go back and reflect, Demita's had a lifespan of 10 to 12 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4490.826s">I</a> don't know if it's 13 to 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4492.986s">But</a> that's a perfect example, a perfect example of when you have a budget that's coming up from the Department of Public Works, having a projection, for example, on new water meters, that dollar amount in anticipation needs to be in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4506.377s">And</a> while it's into the proposed budget that you folks deliberate over, it's likewise the same type of money that can be deliberated over the base fee for which goes in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4517.406s">You</a> back then, Council March, talked about the retained earnings, but the retained earnings, <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4521.781s">has</a> to be something that's certified and qualified by the Department of Revenue and subsequently voted upon by the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4528.587s">So</a> taking all of that into consideration, you're dealing with a multi-million dollar surplus right now in your water and sewer account, and you also have inclusive of that multi-million dollar, you're talking about two and a half million dollars right now that's been collected. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4543.781s">So</a> how does that fit into either retained earnings or the water and sewer balance <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4549.425s">Is</a> it off by two and a half minute because this is a new dollar amount in there?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4585.77s">And</a> in 2016, Mr. President, the deficit was 467,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4587.091s">And</a> in 2017, it was 427,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4587.551s">That</a> was on the SOAR account, but that was offset on the opposite side. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4596.793s">Council</a> March is talking about because of the retained earnings of the surplus that was in the water and sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4601.516s">All</a> I'm saying, all I'm saying is this account, if it's included in your water and sewer account, it should be accounted for and how it's spent or anticipated to be spent, just like any project that's going to be done in the forthcoming year. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4615.767s">And</a> there was also a dollar amount contained in the budget for unanticipated expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4620.991s">You</a> may have a street that just blows open, a major line that blows open, I don't know, but the money is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4626.42s">And</a> lastly, let me just say this, Mr. President, each and every year, I don't know, coming into this year, each and every year, there's been approximately a million dollars in surplus that's left over from the prior year's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4637.769s">So</a> each and every year for the last maybe 10 to 12 years, there's been approximately a million dollars, and that money, which is left over, once it's certified by the Department of Revenue, it's leftover money, can be used for any unanticipated debt deficit that takes place in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4652.761s">But</a> we don't have to do it because you've got surpluses, <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4655.819s">in</a> the water and sewer enterprise.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4658.501s">You're</a> welcome.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2976.834s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2978.175s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marksley. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2979.155s">I</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2979.616s">I</a> don't know if you can hear me, if it makes it any clearer. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2982.658s">What</a> Councilor Marksley has alluded to has brought me into this issue of public accounting as to what took place as it related to this <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2992.09s">connectivity</a> fee, that's what it was called. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2994.373s">So</a> it was implemented in August of 2017, and for the last three years, it has brought in in excess of $3 million to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3003.872s">And</a> having that at $3 million and not knowing how and what it's been used for, and if it was going to be an adjunct to the water and sewer system here in the city of Medford, then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3014.954s">We</a> always get in advance from the MWRA their projected assessment as to what the city is going to be charged for water and sewer charges. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3024.136s">And</a> that is built in your annual budget each and every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3027.357s">And</a> each and every year since then, the projection that this could be possibly used for a deficit has never happened because we're still dealing with the surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3036.084s">So</a> I think what Councilman Marks is alluding to is the fact that, you know, if you've collected $3 million, what have you used it for, number one? <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3044.47s">What</a> do you have projected for its use? <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3047.072s">What</a> is the cost for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3048.893s">And</a> more importantly, if it is separate from water and sewer, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3053.196s">As</a> we know that you can't take the money from water and sewer because that's considered to be retained earnings. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3057.88s">And</a> the only way you can get through retained earnings is to the Department of Revenue to get a waiver and 90% of the time that they will give it to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3065.287s">But</a> this is something that has led me after the resolution went on, if you can just bear with me, to other things that unfortunately the council and the public have not been apprised of and brought forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3077.597s">This</a> base fee charge at a minimum of $51.66 annually, that's on the house side. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3082.405s">I</a> don't know what the commercial side would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3084.489s">But</a> if in fact it's bringing in approximately a million dollars a year, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3090.143s">If</a> you look at your most recent tax bill here in the city of Medford, which is for the third quarter, they implemented a new system with a new vendor. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3098.706s">And</a> the new vendor has really got this bill basically messed up. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3101.867s">It's</a> going to be changed because they made a big mistake on it, especially when it gets to the tax itself and it talks about your CPA tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3110.423s">If</a> you think about what's going on, and if you think about the taxes here that are going on here in the city of Medford, what can we do to some degree to help the Medford taxpayer as to what's going on and everything that's going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3123.413s">So</a> what I would like to just introduce to you is something for you to think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3128.437s">When</a> you look at your water and sewer tax.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3143.901s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3144.422s">If</a> you can look at your water and sewer bill, and if you can look at your tax bill, I'd like to introduce something for the council entertainers. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3150.626s">It's</a> called a deadline discount program. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3154.79s">And</a> a deadline and discount program, which is implemented in a lot of states and a lot of counties, that the month that you get the bill, your tax bill, for example, you get your tax bill in November, and I believe it's due February 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3169.181s">The</a> next one is February 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3171.042s">But</a> if you pay it on the month that you receive it, there's a 4% discount on your bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3176.043s">The</a> next month, which would be January, there would be a 3% discount. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3180.944s">And</a> the city in itself would be getting its money quicker. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3184.125s">And</a> at the same time, the taxpayer would be getting a break as it relates to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3188.806s">Same</a> thing as it relates to your water and sewer bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3191.306s">If</a> you get your water and sewer bill, it's usually six or seven weeks out before you pay it. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3196.247s">And</a> the month that you get it, or the month before, you get a 4% discount if you pay for it ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3201.368s">It's</a> a thought, but it does work because it gets the city money quicker before you get it quicker. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3207.052s">Pinellas</a> County in Florida, one of many counties, have implemented that and they've shown a marketable increase, a marketable increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3215.271s">Another</a> thing, Mr. President, when we talk about the city's unfunded liability, for which this council, I can go back to 2014, Resolution 214725 was offered by myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3227.906s">And</a> that particular resolution asked that on an annual basis, the city of Metra take out of its free cash a minimum <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3234.094s">of</a> $500,000 toward then in fund liability of $29 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3239.976s">I</a> have no idea what the unfunded liability is. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3242.316s">And</a> I don't think this council has any idea of what the balance is and how much each and every year has been taken out of the budget for the purposes of getting to that unfunded liability, which has to be paid by 2029. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3255.54s">Another</a> thing for which the taxpayers and the council should be aware of waste management. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3261.688s">And</a> I don't know if you guys are aware of it, but in March of 2014, then Mayor McGlynn signed an extension, a three-year extension to the waste management contract in the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3273.652s">And</a> that three-year extension went as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3276.353s">For</a> the first year, the City of Medford would get $300,000 in cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3279.734s">The</a> second year, they would get $100,000 more. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3281.475s">That's</a> $400,000 from 2014 going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3282.435s">But</a> the catch to the whole thing was as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3291.705s">The</a> amendment was, if you remember correctly, for those who did serve back then, recycling was an issue here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3300.362s">And</a> at that point in time, when the contract was signed, we were at 11%. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3304.638s">At</a> some point in time, the city worked itself up to a 29% inventory of recycling. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3311.601s">But</a> as a result of the city signing off on a three-year extension, what took place there was that the city of Medford allowed waste management, allowed waste management to increase our cost of recycling on an annual basis projected at <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3330.978s">$85</a> per ton, and then it would set itself on an annual basis increase, according to the city of Boston, beginning on July 1st, 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3341.082s">That's</a> almost six months, that's almost a good year after the contract was signed. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3345.386s">And</a> as a result of that, each and every year, the city of Medford has been being charged more for recycling than they had been according to the original agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3354.596s">So</a> for $300,000, $400,000 that the city got paid up front, the cost of recycling has gone forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3362.103s">And</a> once this contract ends in the year 2023, yeah 2023, all the recycling bins, all the recycling bins that the people have in this city will come under the control of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3373.833s">They'll</a> own it and not waste management. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3376.536s">Another</a> thing that I believe, Mr. President, needs to really be discussed is the CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3381.44s">Once</a> again, taxpayers on an annual basis are at a cost of approximately $103, according to your household, in the value of your home. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3390.427s">Now,</a> the CPA, as we all know, five years are up. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3394.93s">Any</a> time after five years, according to the law, as it's written, that question can go back on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3401.094s">And</a> I would strongly suggest that this council put that question back on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3405.197s">Because</a> when it was first elected in 2015, 1,200 people did not vote on the question because it was on the backside of the ballot, and they didn't know that the question was there to be asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3419.147s">$103,</a> think about that, annually for CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3422.089s">Then</a> you think about the $51 and the connectivity fee, and you put that together with maybe the discounts on paying for your taxes, it would be a great help to the city of Medford and to the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3432.736s">Also,</a> Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3435.025s">Cable</a> costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3436.065s">Our</a> cable bills from the residents of this community keep going up each and every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3441.087s">They</a> just went up again. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3442.848s">But</a> they also have a 5% franchise fee in that cable bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3447.529s">You</a> folks have not got an update on what that increase has brought to the city of Medford and where that money has gone, at least for the last four or five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3456.072s">And</a> I know that's something that Councilor Marks had brought up before. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3459.373s">Then</a> we get to the parking issues, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3474.633s">This</a> presented itself, Mr. President, onto other issues which could be beneficial to the taxpayers, and it would be a public accounting so people could become aware of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3482.655s">Councilor</a> Penta?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3491.977s">Well,</a> we're almost done. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3493.017s">Do</a> you mind if I can just figure it out? <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3494.437s">Because</a> it's unfortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3495.818s">You</a> know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3496.678s">You're</a> supposed to seize the moment as the moment is. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3499.138s">And</a> we're talking about the people of our community, what they have to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3503.039s">Also,</a> at the same time, if we can offer them a benefit, and at the same time, the City gets a benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3507.643s">It's</a> a matter of being creative and looking at what you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3510.746s">Parking</a> information. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3511.746s">You,</a> Mr. President, you have asked on numerous occasions, numerous occasions for a report on how many tickets have been issued, how many have been abated, how much money has been collected, and how much has been given to the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3523.496s">Excuse</a> me, none of you can do that because it's never been presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3526.699s">And</a> what about the $50,000 that was supposed to go to each and every square here in the City of Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3532.38s">It's</a> not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3533.46s">The</a> accounting for the squares hasn't come under any control as to what we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3538.741s">And</a> lastly, Mr. President, if we all remember at the inaugural, we were told that seniors in this city would not have to pay any more to park in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3546.943s">That</a> still hasn't come to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3549.044s">That's</a> unfair, because you can't make a promise like that and not keep it, because that's what people look at, what your responsibilities are. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3557.346s">I</a> say this tonight, Mr. President, as I told you before, taxes pay for what makes this city run. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3563.328s">And</a> at the same time, the city has a responsibility back. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3565.67s">But</a> if it can be a two hand, shaken hands compromise, why not? <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3571.057s">Discounts</a> to your water and sewer bill, discount to your cable bills, finding out where that money went. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3577.301s">And</a> let's get back to the original thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3578.802s">The</a> connectivity fee that was supposed to be helpful here to the city of Medford, you've never had a report where it's going, how much it's brought in, what projects, if anything, and how much it's gonna cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3589.408s">And</a> why should that be considered an adjunct to the Water and Sewer Commission money, when in fact, if you can't project your budget in the future, <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3597.453s">Like</a> you're supposed to, and you get your water and sewer estimate ahead of time from the MWRA. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3603.083s">We</a> should not be thinking about a deficit when, again, you're just taking more money from the taxpayer without giving them the reason why you took it. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3610.389s">I'd</a> be more than happy to answer any questions, but I would hope that one of you, someone, even would get into the idea of showing and having some kind of a discount in advance for people who pay their taxes and for people who pay their water and sewer bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3624.659s">It's</a> out there, it's been a proven fact, and it does work. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3627.582s">And</a> it'd be a great handshake between taxpayers and the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3630.844s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Paeta. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3634.426s">I'd</a> be more than happy to answer any questions.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3638.628s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3795.796s">Mr.</a> Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3796.997s">Mr.</a> President, before you call the roll, one quick thing as a notation on the tax bills that come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3802.279s">You'll</a> notice it says police, fire, and library. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3805.68s">It</a> says 10, 25, 30, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3808.461s">Whoever</a> checks that, when those bills come out every quarter, I think it would be informative to have next to each one of those items how much money has been donated so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3819.676s">Because</a> that would give either an incentive or not for somebody to make a contribution. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3823.281s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3868.902s">On</a> the bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3869.422s">Okay,</a> under each item it'll tell you, they can put in parentheses, that would designate how much money.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3914.989s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4805.815s">Summit</a> Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4807.216s">Mr.</a> President, I want to go back to something that I had said earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4810.318s">I</a> would like the council to entertain what they call a deadline and discount program. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4815.442s">This</a> would relate itself to your water bills and also to your taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4820.807s">And</a> as I said before, it is well practiced in some states and some cities and towns where <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4828.112s">On</a> the month that you receive, for example, your tax bill, if you pay it that month, you get a 4% discount. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4834.174s">If</a> you pay it the next month before the bill is due, you get a 3% discount. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4838.556s">Or</a> you wait till the very last day and pay it like a lot of people do. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4842.178s">Same</a> thing with the water bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4843.398s">The</a> water bills doesn't have as much of a leeway time between the tax bills when they come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4848.14s">But</a> in the month that you receive the bill, it's usually halfway through the month. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4851.441s">If</a> you pay it that month, it's a 4% discount. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4854.202s">I</a> think it works well because it's a handshake between the cities and the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4858.343s">And</a> if the taxpayer is looking for a little bit of a break, there it is right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4862.204s">If</a> you pay your bill ahead of time, you get a discount. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4864.625s">And</a> at the same time, the city gets its money to use at a quicker rate for whatever purpose it has. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4870.167s">I</a> think it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4871.007s">I</a> think it makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4872.467s">And</a> there's no loss to either side. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4874.228s">I</a> think it's a benefit to either side. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4875.889s">And</a> at the same time, <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4877.509s">What</a> you're doing is you're telling the taxpayers, you're basically thinking out for them the best way you can, and you're thinking out for the city the best way you can, because you're giving us the money quicker than we would have gotten if we had to wait almost eight weeks for you to pay your tax bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4891.9s">So</a> I would hope someone on the council would entertain it, present it before a committee of the whole for the purposes of discussing it, and moving forward with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4900.103s">It</a> works. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4902.424s">It</a> works in other cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4903.445s">It</a> works in other states and other cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4905.905s">And</a> as I told you earlier, it's just a way of saying to the taxpayers, we're hearing what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4914.149s">Everybody's</a> got these problems today. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4916.21s">We</a> want to help you out. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4918.067s">And</a> the second thing on the citizen participation, I just don't understand why tax seniors have to pay that once a year $25 tax to park in the city when we were told in January inauguration that the seniors would be able to park for nothing in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4933.387s">That</a> still hasn't happened yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4934.689s">I</a> don't know why. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4936.311s">It's</a> a promise that should have been kept, that needs to be kept, and it's just, once again, it's, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4942.895s">I</a> don't know how the city's operating lately, but all I can tell you is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4945.877s">You've</a> got to look for creative ways to keep the people's interest, and at the same time, to keep your own interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4953.022s">And</a> what I presented here tonight, I think, is a pretty good handshake with the taxpayers and with the city of Medford as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4961.959s">Be</a> more than happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4963.38s">When</a> we talk about money here in the city of Medford, you talk about how the city is going to function. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4970.585s">And</a> the city can only function when the taxpayers are willing to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4973.847s">And</a> sometimes people become delinquent in paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4976.349s">And</a> if they become delinquent, they can't pay it because they don't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4979.291s">And</a> if those people that do have it want to relinquish some of their money quicker, <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4983.774s">and</a> get a discount for doing it, it helps the city because they get the money quicker. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4987.997s">And</a> the last thing I want to say, Mr. President, I think it really needs to entertain itself that the CPA, which is now five years has come and gone, should be looked at about presenting itself on the ballot this November coming in 2021 for the purposes of whether you're going to use it again and re-up it and what have you, because that's what the law says. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5005.57s">I'm</a> not advocating for it or against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5007.292s">What</a> I'm advocating is that the five years are up. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5010.195s">The</a> sunset legislation is now in effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5012.938s">And</a> if you don't do nothing, it's just going to stay there. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5016.261s">1,200</a> people in 2015 did not vote on that question because it was on the opposite side of the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5022.348s">They</a> weren't aware it was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5024.17s">So</a> we really have no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5026.172s">whether</a> it would have passed or it didn't pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5028.474s">This</a> time, I think it would be incumbent if the question goes on the ballot, it's there, and the taxpayers make their decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5034.879s">That's</a> what it's about, the taxpayers' use of their money. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5037.521s">I'd</a> be more than happy to answer any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5041.625s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5042.686s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5157.829s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5158.569s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5167.819s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5169.443s">Relative</a> to Councilor Bears' comment, it doesn't make any difference whether it's in-state or out-of-state. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5173.986s">It's</a> how a city sets its tax rate and how it makes its collections. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5178.329s">All</a> I'm making reference to the fact that it works in other states. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5181.852s">It's</a> out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5182.893s">I</a> believe there's a few cities and towns in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5185.735s">It's</a> not my call. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5186.876s">It's</a> only an offering to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5188.677s">And</a> if it works, as Councilor Marks has alluded to, how can it not work if you're getting your money quicker and you're having a discount paying it ahead of time? <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5196.683s">That's</a> all I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5197.644s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_puRJAp7j8rg/2024-11-19_puRJAp7j8rg.html">City Council 01-28-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=409.898s">Good</a> evening, my name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, and a former member of the August body. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=415.92s">I</a> come here tonight <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=417.987s">To</a> make some comments on issues that I feel are important as it relates to this upcoming budget, from what I understand this administration, and I know the Chief of Staff is here, he can reflect upon the fact that you guys and Lady are going to get an early budget this year, earlier than normal. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=435.088s">If</a> that's true, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=436.529s">Is</a> it true? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=437.628s">So</a> he says we hope so. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=438.768s">With</a> that being said, and with two new Councilors on the board, I would just like to reflect upon a couple of things as it relates to what really has not been addressed for the past few months. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=449.69s">First</a> of all, going back to last year at some point in time regarding the Lawrence Memorial Hospital, we never got a report back from the auditor's office as it relates to the outpatient surgical offices that are going to be housed <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=465.453s">in</a> the old Lawrence Memorial Hospital as part of an addendum to the 16,000 square foot building that the Lawrence Memorial Hospital is going to have their surgical center at. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=475.719s">And</a> with that being said, again, it's just out there floating around not knowing what's going to happen because they haven't made a decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=483.203s">Second</a> of all, it's the taxing of the nonprofit funeral portion <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=488.206s">of</a> the operation at the Gaffey Funeral Home, which houses the Islamic Cultural Center here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=495.068s">And</a> where they're going to be running a funeral business out of that center, once again, it presents itself as a for-profit business within the non-profit structure itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=506.011s">Again,</a> no answers come back on that as of yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=509.192s">And</a> these are issues that I think need to be discussed and resolved before or at least during your budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=515.834s">Also,</a> let's go back to something that Councilor Caraviello, when he first came on to the Council, talked about, the disrepair of the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=524.222s">At</a> that point in time, Councilor Caraviello indicated during his first term, it was $1.2 million of school repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=530.908s">We're</a> now in excess of $1.5 million of school repairs, and we're getting ourselves right into the same position, I shouldn't say ourselves, the city is getting itself into this position <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=541.758s">of</a> why we had to build new schools in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=544.059s">If</a> the upkeep is not going to be taking place, there is something wrong with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=549.401s">The</a> building of a new police station, contained within the building of the new police station, it's 5,000 square feet less than what was asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=557.965s">There</a> is no police firing range that is for qualification. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=563.208s">But</a> more importantly, the sad part about the whole thing, no police vehicle is going to be able to be housed internally. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=568.91s">They're</a> all going to be outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=571.365s">And</a> by doing that, all you're doing is leaving all your public service vehicles open to the elements. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=577.03s">So</a> if there's a snowstorm or whatever it might be, every police officer's gonna have to go out there and take the snow off it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=582.034s">And</a> you try to explain that to the people of this community and you tell them that you're spending close to $20 million for a new police station, but you have no place to house or at least care for your police cruisers. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=594.656s">A</a> very important issue that seems to be lost in the weeds is the, at present, if not more, a $29 million unfunded pension liability that needs to be paid by 2029. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=606.781s">That</a> is yet to be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=610.322s">Also,</a> what needs to be addressed right now also is a citywide <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=616.474s">It's</a> called the Citywide Home Water Meter Battery Replacement Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=621.317s">Now</a> for those of you that have a house and you know when you get your water and sewer bill, the system was put in well over 10 years ago with meters that were only good for 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=631.523s">The</a> 10 years have come and gone, that's a cost factor and that's a replacement that needs to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=637.446s">We</a> still have yet to receive a cost projection for a new fire station as to where it will be, when it will be, and what it will cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=646.17s">There</a> is no projections out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=648.451s">And</a> still outstanding is the new training tower that was promised it would be built before the old one was taken down. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=657.274s">Well,</a> the old one has been taken down, and now nothing has been put up. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=662.116s">And</a> in fact, it does affect, in the city of Medford, your home insurance rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=667.213s">There's</a> no financial outline as to how the city's annual free cash should be prioritized. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=673.275s">For</a> the new councils coming on board, for the last few many years, it's almost a million dollars each and every year the city of Medford has left over, it just goes into free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=682.278s">So</a> that presents itself with one or two arguments. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=684.399s">Number</a> one, the budget is either not accurate, or number two, that million dollars is maybe not correct when the budget is being voted upon at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=694.463s">So</a> therefore, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=697.506s">To</a> me, it makes very good sense because a lot of cities and towns do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=701.488s">You</a> folks pass a budget in May or June, let's call it June, that should be the time you set your tax rate, not six months later. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=709.672s">So</a> if you do that, you're working on an actual annual budget that reflects upon that vote that took place in June that represents itself to each and every dollar itemized. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=722.077s">Also,</a> a public works five-year projection program that covers our streets, our sidewalks, our tree stumps, our equipment, our water repairs issues, and cemetery, as well as all personnel that's gonna be needed to address that. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=737.109s">That</a> would be a great program to have because number one, we're already understaffed and we're hiring immediately just two more people to work in the highway department that just basically on a daily basis is so understaffed and on demand. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=749.895s">Lastly,</a> for the purposes of at least this portion of the discussion, two points. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=756.477s">And</a> I know Councilor Caraviello once again has asked for this and Councilor Marks, you've asked for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=760.598s">You</a> should get a five-year financial recap from Park Medford on all the receipts taken in and what has been given to the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=768.459s">I</a> guarantee none of you have received anything from Park Medford as it relates to that financial responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=775.501s">And</a> lastly, Councilor Marks, you brought this up, yet to be determined <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=779.182s">Where</a> and for what reasons has the $500,000 from Tufts University been accounted for? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=785.185s">You</a> still don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=786.245s">We</a> still don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=788.186s">Now</a> moving over to the housing issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=791.345s">And</a> here's an issue right now that's in the forefront of everything as to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=796.447s">So</a> let's just mention a few little things that are going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=800.028s">Right</a> now what we have on the books are 185 units that are coming online after Wendy's on Middlesex Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=807.19s">You</a> have 300 plus units opposite the Wellington Station. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=811.191s">You</a> have a proposed 400 Chapter 40B units next to the Middlesex Courthouse on Mystic Valley Parkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=818.553s">And</a> looking at the smaller neighborhood issue that took place on Forest Street, where a private developer wanted to maximize a single-family residence to a multi-family use zone, that caused a tremendous amount of consultation not only to the neighborhood, but the Medford Historical Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=836.195s">Going</a> back, you go to 61 Toro Street, where you had an old magnificent home over there for which Tufts University was involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=843.243s">And</a> they sort of like wanted to take advantage of the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=846.026s">But</a> through the neighborhood pushing back, that didn't take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=850.475s">Right</a> now, as of tomorrow night, you're going to have before the Board of Appeals, where the old Titan gas station is on Boston Avenue and Harvard Street, a condominium proposed development. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=861.519s">And</a> then you have rumored development of a new condos behind the Middlesex Avenue Mall. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=867.522s">Once</a> again, a rumored development of 30 plus condos on South Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=872.784s">And</a> a rumored Boston Avenue multi-housing development. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=878.123s">Then,</a> at the end of last summer, 500 multi-use development was proposed by Combined Properties of Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=887.529s">And</a> after a large community opposition, led by then City Councilor and now Mayor, Lungo-Koehn, as well as Gene Nuzzo and Cheryl Rodriguez, the project was forced to be scrapped by the developer. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=904.521s">Now,</a> some six months later, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=907.52s">This</a> same company, Combined Properties, is now proposing a 37, 378 residential unit, and the application for approval is coming along under a Chapter 40B proposal, entirely different than what they originally had. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=924.773s">The</a> real wake-up call to this whole issue right now on housing here in the City of Medford should have taken place at 61 Locust Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=932.179s">The</a> massive development that is opposite Wegmans right now, which was originally scheduled for over 500 units, and they've culled it down to 345. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=942.412s">Neighborhood</a> protests pushed it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=945.033s">But</a> as in any big business development, what did they do? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=949.075s">They</a> went into the neighbors that were pushing back and they bought every single home over there for them to at least come back with $345,000 and still make the money that they're going to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=960.103s">As</a> I said some years ago, and as I said during this past campaign, the City of Medford needs to embark on a moratorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=967.685s">A</a> moratorium on its zoning, and more importantly, a complete review of its zoning here in the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=975.207s">And</a> the reason why the moratorium would work <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=978.311s">is</a> because our zoning has not been reviewed for a multitude of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=982.653s">So</a> you're saying to any proposed developer that comes in, I will propose this affordable housing, which is not the same as a Chapter 40B, because remember, affordable housing is something that's compensated in part or given great latitude by state laws, whereas a Chapter 40B is a private independent entity coming in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1004.523s">So</a> sure, they'll give you their affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1007.284s">but</a> they'll back in the cost on the remaining units that are in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1011.186s">So</a> how does that qualify and justify for an affordable housing process? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1015.489s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1016.95s">But</a> also, you should be looking into what they call a growth management proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1023.934s">And</a> the reason why I say that is because we have right here in our own city, a sister city, it's called Malden, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1033.829s">And</a> in 2015, they put a question on the ballot, and their ballot question revolved around what you have been talking about, Councilor Falco, the Malden Hospital, what we're going to do with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1045.737s">The</a> second thing is the Community Preservation Act, what are we gonna do with that as far as open space? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1050.98s">And</a> their third question was the moratorium on high-density, multi-level development. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1057.564s">It</a> won by 71% of the vote, and they had a moratorium, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1063.834s">proposal</a> that passed and it went from January of 2016 to December of 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1068.516s">Now</a> incorporated into that <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1076.522s">was</a> the density of the immediate neighborhood taken into consideration, the height, the number of units, as well as the zoning exemptions that were being challenged. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1087.07s">And</a> as a result of that, they have now, I think if you go to them all, then you can be able to see, if you look at their development office, I don't know if they call it Office of Community Development, they do have a serious situation where they had developers just coming in all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1102.765s">Medford</a> has a serious problem in having a workable business community, a business development community. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1110.249s">Approximately</a> 10.2% of the business in this community is commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1115.171s">Who</a> bears the rest of that brunt? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1117.172s">It's</a> the residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1118.553s">And</a> I know every time when you folks turn around and do your budget, you talk about a residential factor making it the highest or the lowest or whatever it might be, you're still putting the burden <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1127.998s">on</a> the taxpayer who owns his residential home, and you're not taking the exemption for the out-of-state person. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1133.761s">So,</a> with that being said, and if we continue to go on this road, or this, how can you say, this road, so to speak, of not increasing our commercial base, all you're going to do is just going to be commercial, I mean, raising in the future your residential rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1148.628s">Now,</a> after what took place in Malden, and after what took place after that, we can switch ourselves over to the city of,
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1161.081s">You</a> want somebody else to talk?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1164.744s">OK,</a> well, I'm on my last page. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1166.526s">I'm</a> on my last page.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1168.767s">So</a> after Malden, beside Malden, in 2015, the city of Revere, and again in 2018, put that question of a moratorium, high density, multi-use positions over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1179.916s">And</a> their situation over there revolved itself around large scale buildings, traffic, public safety, schools, and roads were going to be at issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1188.163s">And</a> the claims that Revere was not growing geographically, but rather becoming more dense without any economic development is just like what's going on right here in our city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1200.088s">And</a> with that being said, that the challenge for affordable housing in Chapter 40B as we speak today, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1205.43s">would</a> be the luxury of using our at-present zoning laws and skirt around the real issue of reasonably priced housing and rental. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1214.596s">There</a> are two or three companies in the United States that take into effect low-moderate housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1221.3s">Veterans</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1223.098s">middle-income</a> people, but not high-end middle-income people, middle-income people, and that's a determination by a professional. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1229.963s">We</a> don't have that expertise over here, and I know on the ballot here tonight, on our agenda, there's a question regarding Chapter 40B, but if you really look at just Chapter 40B, and you realize that developer is not there to lose money, and he's putting housing in a densely populated area, you're violating all the reasoning of why a neighborhood should be a neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1253.438s">And</a> as a result of that, moratoriums does not have to go on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1257.602s">A</a> moratorium can be placed by this council, by this mayor, or jointly together. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1262.266s">And</a> recognizing the fact, and recognizing the fact, we are a city just as running, allowing housing to be any place and everywhere at any time. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1270.152s">And</a> because of that, that's not good. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1272.054s">That's</a> not healthy for the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1274.136s">As</a> I said before a long time ago, development for the sake of development isn't the best thing that can happen in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1279.58s">We</a> have schools, we have public safety, we have public works. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1282.822s">We</a> have a whole host of issues that taxpayers have to increasingly pay for. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1287.005s">And</a> our best example of that is when they talked about stations landing, that they said at that point in time, that was going to lower our tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1293.909s">Well,</a> the tax rate has never gone down once since station landing. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1297.271s">As</a> a matter of fact, it just continuously goes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1300.794s">I'd</a> be more than happy to answer any questions, but I just think it's important to have brought this up, especially for our two new councils, but more importantly for all seven of you, because this administration and you as a new council needs to address issues that basically address these matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1318.0s">They</a> haven't been addressed, and they need to be addressed, and you just can't sit here and say, okay, we'll get to it someday, because someday has already come. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1327.983s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1331.362s">Larry,</a> could you, I made copies of my comments for all of your Councilors, so in case you missed anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1341.869s">The</a> part that I appreciated the most when I served on this board for 36 years was the fact that I was willing to hear opposite viewpoints. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1351.193s">But</a> when it comes to finances, two and two equals four. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1355.534s">And</a> when it comes to neighborhoods, the people who live in the neighborhood should come first. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1360.056s">Not</a> out-of-towners, not developers who want to come in there and make a whole bunch of money and then leave us. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1365.958s">Perfect</a> example is Lumineer on Locust Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1369.139s">They</a> built the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1370.7s">They</a> said they were going to stay there. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1372.201s">They</a> went to the Board of Appeals to get what they had to. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1374.762s">And</a> one year later, they sold off the building and made $62 million at the expense of the Medford taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1382.327s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I thank you for listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1384.868s">And</a> if there's any questions, I'd be more than happy to answer them.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1395.594s">Can</a> I ask a question?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3509.89s">Name</a> and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3517.376s">Robert</a> Penta, 0 Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3520.078s">I'm</a> really getting confused on this whole issue right now, because I thought.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3529.065s">Let</a> me just ask this. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3530.526s">Let</a> me ask just one question.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3532.127s">And</a> to me, this is where I would be going with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3535.45s">I'm</a> trying to understand, you're telling me that don't raise the value of land. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3540.412s">And</a> if you don't raise the value of land, you'll have a better neighborhood or a better atmosphere, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3546.174s">So</a> with that being taken, taking place, what you're saying is that <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3550.936s">ignore</a> zoning because zoning is a big reason why land values go up and if you are going to take out the free competitive spirit of Somebody buying a piece of property and doing what he wants by ignoring the zoning laws that absolutely exist at the present time whether it be for a chapter 40 B or affordable zoning that flies in the face of <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3573.656s">of</a> what the petition is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3575.978s">And</a> I think what Dr. Starello is basically trying to say, all you're doing is moving the debt from today till tomorrow, and when tomorrow comes, whether it's two today or 10 or 12 or 14, what are you dealing with? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3587.469s">Somebody's</a> gonna wind up paying for it, but in the meantime, it's a cost factor that's being reflected upon everyday taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3594.014s">So</a> when somebody says that the value of land, don't put it on the value of land, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3599.079s">That</a> seems to be the intrinsic value of how developers seem to come into a community, see the value. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3605.281s">They</a> don't care about the location. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3606.821s">They</a> don't care about what the density is going to do with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3609.842s">And</a> it's your zoning that's gonna predicate the value of land and its use of land and neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3615.804s">That's</a> how I read what Councilor Morell just offered. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3619.225s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4953.551s">Barpenta,</a> Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4955.972s">So</a> this is going to reflect back on some of the comments that I made a little bit earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4960.033s">First</a> of all, the City of Medford is a member of the Massachusetts Municipal Association, and they have individuals who are very professional in the housing portion of what we're talking about here right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4971.397s">To</a> go out and hire a private consultant that pushes and advocates for Chapter 40B, I don't think would be a very wise idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4980.424s">Oh,</a> against the 40B. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4981.825s">I</a> thought you said... I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4984.927s">Well,</a> you may not have to do that because if the Office of Community Development gets itself redesigned, hopefully you would have somebody up there who would understand what the process is. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4992.771s">You</a> have to understand something. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4994.152s">There's</a> a difference between Chapter 40B, which does come under a few Massachusetts housing management departments, as compared to affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5004.337s">Affordable</a> housing is usually a private, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5007.779s">But</a> working with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, who to some degree sets some standards up there as it relates to not only affordability, which has to be, but the permanent and perpetuity of having the <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5020.091s">the</a> reduced cost unit, whether it be the rental or whether it be the housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5025.694s">Chapter</a> 40B is made for a private developer. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5029.536s">He'll</a> come in there and say in the city of Medford, well, you've got to get between, your income level has to be 80% of the medium income in the area that you're applying to put the housing in. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5038.642s">And</a> if that be the case, you know, we can do that or we'll put 100 units up. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5044.456s">25,</a> 2025, whatever the number's gonna turn out to be, will be affordable, and we'll just raise the cost on the other end of the units. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5050.54s">So</a> what did you wind up getting? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5052.341s">You</a> really didn't complete anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5055.683s">Me</a> personally, my suggestion would be that the city goes into a complete moratorium on any and all development to take place, because you don't have anything right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5064.228s">You</a> have a Chapter 40B person who can come in, who just came in right now on Mystic Avenue, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5069.591s">and</a> will bypass your height restrictions and other zoning requirements because that's what 40B is allowed to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5075.919s">If</a> you read chapter 69 of chapter 49, excuse me, of chapter 40B, that's what they'll tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5084.229s">They</a> can come in and they detour and they go around. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5086.972s">And</a> I know you guys, Councilor Knight and Councilor Scarpelli, have talked about over the last two or three years, zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5092.296s">So</a> maybe you should hire a zoning consultant right now to figure out how you bring up an update of a 40-year-old zoning that you have here in the city of Medford because every Chapter 40B that comes in here will bypass upstairs and they'll get around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5105.606s">And</a> that's the privilege that you have for being a Chapter 40B participant, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5110.589s">So</a> if you want to have a Chapter 40B <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5113.231s">be</a> participant that works with the city, then that's what you need. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5116.813s">You</a> need to have someone who goes into the neighborhood and sees where the project is going and how is it going to enhance. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5122.417s">It's</a> not gonna produce a density buster. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5125.699s">That's</a> what you don't want, and that's what's happening right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5128.281s">Density</a> busting all over the city, because private developers know how to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5132.784s">They're</a> efficient at doing it, they make it sound good, and what do you have left? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5137.387s">You</a> have all these developments all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5140.797s">schools,</a> police, fire, public works, infrastructure, water and sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5147.159s">It's</a> all affected by this, all affected by this. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5150.44s">And</a> while it might sound good that it looks good, that's what you're paying for in your taxes for which our commercial tax rate can't even handle because it's only a 10%. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5160.664s">So</a> the burden once again is right back onto the residential taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5165.025s">I</a> think it's a great idea to get into the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5168.442s">But</a> if you read this case after case after case where cities and towns are so sorry that they went into Chapter 40B because it did not turn out to be what it was supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5178.185s">And</a> the fastest way to correct a Chapter 40B problem is to make sure that your zoning speaks for what you want today and for tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5186.767s">It's</a> the financial viability of what a community has to deal with as it relates to a Chapter 40B. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5192.409s">Not</a> affordable housing, it's a Chapter 40B. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5195.029s">They're</a> in two entirely different requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5197.97s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5254.154s">Well,</a> if you go to the city of Somerville, they just went through it for a year and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5257.236s">They</a> stopped, they had a moratorium as it relates to that type of development that took place over there because of what was taking place so fast.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5266.301s">They</a> did nothing for that period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5268.442s">as</a> it relates to multi-use development.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5274.404s">To</a> the best of my, to moratorium, so that means you can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5277.205s">Another</a> point of information.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5290.871s">One</a> of the things that a Chapter 40B does tell you, if they go before a Board of Appeals, if the Board of Appeals feels, this is the term that they use, and it's not a friendly Chapter 40B, that's the term, friendly, they can shoot that down. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5306.196s">Now,</a> what determines to be friendly? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5309.157s">It</a> could be public health, it could be public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5311.678s">Those</a> are the two biggest issues that you'd have going. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5314.879s">Other</a> than being in a residential neighborhood and making it high density, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5318.953s">That's</a> a subjective thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5320.194s">That's</a> all I can tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5322.055s">But</a> if you are going to hire somebody, or Office of Community Development is going to employ somebody, consultant or otherwise, that's the first thing I would address, because you have such archaic laws, you can go to the Board of Appeals right now and come in and make a proposal, and you can't shoot it down, because YDB will allow you to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5343.814s">It's</a> an interesting concept and the city of Medford really needs to address it because you've gone at a fever pitch over the past many years with all kinds of development and there's no checks and balances to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5358.449s">61</a> Locust Street is really the issue that should bring this all to a head. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5362.713s">It</a> should have brought it to a head then when they wanted to put 500 units there. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5366.676s">Okay,</a> and what did they do? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5368.499s">The</a> big developer went in there and bought out the neighborhood, bought out every single house in the neighborhood, and they reduced it to 345, which the Board of Appeals allowed, and it managed to put itself through.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5391.19s">I</a> believe that the reason, I believe Councilor, the reason why the city lost is because the neighborhood agreed to the reduction of $345,000 after they all got bought out. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5401.379s">So</a> our suit was completely moved at that point in time.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5422.466s">But</a> they felt it had zero standing, but also the then mayor at the time refused to give additional money to go forward with the case.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5431.493s">You</a> could have appealed.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5454.052s">But</a> I also believe, Mr. President, when you lost the issue on standing, it was a moot issue, because all the people, the residents, pushed back on the lawsuit, because they all got bought out. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5464.315s">So</a> the standing for which the council had was not being supported by the neighborhood, which initiated the lawsuit in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5472.076s">And</a> the council got originally $20,000 in the beginning to get the case going.<h2><a href="../2018-02-28_cWHRmg4nTSM/2018-02-28_cWHRmg4nTSM.html">Medford City Council 02/27/18</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2668.477s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2670.351s">Name</a> and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2671.753s">Robert</a> M. Pentez, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of this party. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2675.557s">You</a> know, the world is in a changing state of times right now, and I think what Councilman Marks has introduced is something that could be epidemic anywhere in this country, but it's not the first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2685.229s">It's</a> been here before. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2686.69s">You</a> know, you as Councilors, you have a 50 percent voice in the school department budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2691.653s">And</a> if you see something that's not taking place in their budget, for example, under school security, and here's a prime example of what school security is all about, this is the opportunity to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2701.057s">If</a> the school committee knows that the city council is with them and trying to help them, that's a great leadership quality. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2707.501s">And</a> I don't think anybody in any municipal or state or federal capacity should sit back. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2712.043s">If</a> you've got something to say that revolves around security, <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2714.683s">Say</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2715.003s">That's</a> what you're getting paid for. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2716.423s">That's</a> what the people expect from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2718.924s">With</a> that being said, Mr. President, not only do I think it's a good movement, I think it would be wise, as a suggestion being offered to the school committee, that they review their entire policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2730.526s">And</a> now, knowing that they're going to be having a new superintendent as of June or at the end of May or whatever it might be, if not sooner, whatever the situation might be, here's an opportunity to start to clean house on issues that are really of a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2743.352s">Maybe</a> the gun clip said something. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2746.053s">But</a> the review of the policy is what it's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2749.533s">People</a> in the building that nobody knows nothing about. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2752.234s">And</a> I think it's a good motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2754.755s">And</a> I would hope the council votes approval.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4471.125s">My</a> name is Robert Pentez, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4474.406s">The</a> stress and anxiety of Clipgate, that's what I call it, Clipgate, has needlessly caused our city an embarrassed showing for collective management when they thought nobody was looking. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4485.85s">Dating</a> back to December 28th, when the ammo clip was first found, <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4490.832s">A</a> cast of characters have become principal components to the investigation, starting with the cleaning company personnel who first found the clip. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4500.034s">We</a> have further parties of interest in the school custodian, Mr. Edwards, the principal at the McGlynn School, Mr. Belson, the school superintendent, the resource officer, Medford police officer, Riccati, Mr. McLaughlin, director of building and grounds, Mayor Burke, and school employees who brought this to the attention of Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4521.859s">When</a> Councilor Lungo-Koehn notified the police on Thursday, December 15th, of this concern brought to her attention by school employees, the school building was swept on Tuesday, February 20th, according to news reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4535.225s">Thankfully,</a> Breanna Lungo-Koehn and Councilor Marks addressed this matter at their next council meeting with many concerned parents in attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4543.889s">This</a> past Thursday, February 22nd, <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4546.573s">at</a> the Karen Little Theater at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4549.434s">Seven</a> days after Breonna Lungelkorn notified police, the mayor called for a school committee meeting wherein hundreds of Medford citizens, teachers, and administrators attended to discuss the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4561.997s">When</a> Mayor Burke, as chairperson of the school committee, first found out about this matter, and from whom and what did she do, she has yet to disclose that matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4571.714s">While</a> the February 22nd meeting revealed a lot of anger and displeasure as to what the Clipgate incident has caused, it also revealed shortcomings to questions asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4584.843s">One</a> glaring question, and yet to be answered, was, who was the we that decided not to share the info at the outset? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4593.908s">The</a> Medford Police, under the direction of Chief Sacco, is leading the in-house investigation regarding this incident, as he should. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4601.664s">If</a> the Medford police are good enough to investigate a murder, stolen property, drug dealing, and other crimes within their daily jobs, they now don't need to be upstaged by the mayor and her hiring of her close, personal, and financially rewarding political friend, Martha Coakley. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4620.247s">Mayor</a> Burke, on her own, without any discussion, approval, or vote of record from the school committee, has hired her close personal friend, former Attorney General Martha Coakley, who has contributed $1,000 to Mayor Burke's campaign to do this independent personnel investigation because of this matter as it's reported in the news reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4643.868s">This</a> independent personnel investigation should have no ties nor relationships to any politicians in our cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4652.535s">I</a> ask, where is the transparency to this matter? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4655.898s">Independent</a> means just what it says. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4659.02s">Free</a> and devoid from any influence, guidance, or counsel of another or others, nor affiliated with or loyal to no one political party, organization, or voter. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4670.767s">Both</a> Mrs. Burke and Mrs. Coakley are both Democrats. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4674.67s">This</a> hiring of Martha Coakley by Mayor Burke is a sole source contract, a contract awarded without competitive bidding. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4684.476s">It</a> directs itself to cronyism, particularly in awarding jobs to friends or trusted colleagues in politics between politicians. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4694.375s">This</a> hiring also prevents presents, excuse me, a serious question as to whether Mayor Burke has violated the state ethics law on the chapter 62. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4704.318s">Massachusetts</a> General Law, Chapter 268A, wherein the law states if a conflict is apparent, or the appearance is a telling sign, then a violation of the law is readily at hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4716.627s">A</a> public employee may not act in a manner that would cause a reasonable person to think that she would show favor toward someone or that she can be improperly influenced. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4728.535s">I</a> stand here not to question the ability or the capability <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4733.222s">of</a> Martha Coakley, but rather the concern of a state ethics conflict of interest, as well as to her individual unspecified cost from her very expensive downtown Boston law firm of Foley and Hogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4748.798s">Mayor</a> Burke's relationship with Martha Coakley has been long and financially rewarding. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4754.15s">I</a> find it interesting that Mayor Burke is now concerned with having an independent personnel investigation, but where is her outside independent audit of the school department if she is so concerned about righting the ship? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4767.832s">I</a> do not believe we need a very expensive, close, personal, and political friend of the mayor to address Medford's employee personnel policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4777.495s">Medford</a> is a good city with tons of good people in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4781.156s">Let</a> this incident be the thoughtful reminder that when the law is not followed and protocols are not in place, and when city leaders take it upon themselves to make decisions that fly in the face of potential safety and what the law says, <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4797.221s">then</a> all involved, no matter who, as this case has demonstrated, shall be held accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4804.826s">For</a> the truth only has one consequence. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4808.468s">Let</a> no cover-up be worse than the crime itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4812.73s">I</a> would like to conclude by making a correction to a statement I made last Thursday at the school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4819.743s">At</a> the conclusion of my commentary and in my haste, I misread what I meant to say, and it was as follows, what I meant to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4828.807s">What</a> happened in Florida was horrific, and hopefully we all have learned something here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4834.269s">The</a> people of Medford want action, and as city officials, you owe it to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4839.411s">Now,</a> with that being said, Mr. President, again, <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4843.374s">You</a> folks have been through the whole issue of conflict of interest, whether it be your pay raises or jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4849.616s">This</a> is a very serious matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4852.077s">This</a> hiring of Mrs. Coakley out of the Clear Blue Sky, while this incident is going on, I believe does not speak well for the police investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4862.041s">I</a> don't think it speaks well for the Medford Police Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4864.722s">They</a> can handle their own investigation, and if it turns out to be <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4867.505s">something</a> on one of their own, they will resolve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4870.128s">If</a> it's something that's resolved here in the building, an employee, it will be resolved internally. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4875.435s">And</a> if the need is to have <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4877.934s">an</a> updated personnel policy that hasn't taken place since this mayor has come into being, well then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4885.06s">But</a> to hire someone who paid you, strike that, who gave you $1,000 in political contributions, smacks with the theory that this is directly a conflict of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4897.591s">And</a> this is a sole source contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4899.893s">There</a> was no need for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4901.821s">There</a> was no need to go out with no competition, no bidding on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4905.043s">This</a> wasn't a serious emergency that needed to be done and nobody could be contacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4909.825s">So</a> I really think it needs to be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4912.166s">And</a> I think the city solicitor needs to review it with you council. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4915.067s">I</a> would hope someone on the council would ask that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4918.449s">Why</a> did the mayor go ahead and do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4919.649s">The</a> mayor hasn't even notified you fellas and you yet that she's hired Mrs. Coakley for this particular purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4926.578s">to</a> do this investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4928.279s">I</a> don't know how much she charges. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4929.819s">People</a> say she charges $500 an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4932.16s">Well,</a> how many hours is she going to go for and how long is this going to go on for? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4936.022s">The</a> taxpayers of this community need to know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4938.663s">And</a> this issue of her being hired should not be disguised because of this ammo gate that's going on here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4946.106s">They</a> are two separate issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4949.227s">And</a> the mayor needs to respond and answer that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4952.411s">Was</a> she part of the we that made the decision not to disclose the information, dating back as early as December 28th and bringing it up to February 15th when Councilor Longo-Curran brought this to everybody's attention because of people bringing it to her attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4967.842s">You</a> know, if you remember closely what the Chief said when the question was asked of him about the picture with the clip with the gun, because I was the one that asked him, where did you get that picture, Chief? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4978.45s">And</a> he says he got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4980.046s">from</a> the Director of Buildings and Grounds, Mr. McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4983.468s">So</a> I gave you seven people in the beginning that start this whole thing going that have to be interviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4988.25s">Possibly</a> every single elected official probably should be interviewed and asked a question, because maybe some of you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4993.393s">Maybe</a> some of you have been told something. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4994.954s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4996.115s">But</a> you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4996.895s">It's</a> a very serious incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4998.776s">Last</a> Thursday night, up at that high school, there were so many people that were so impassioned as to what they were saying that sometimes it just looked like it might have or it could have gotten out of hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5010.32s">But</a> logic and common sense and calmness has to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5015.043s">We</a> all know now that there is an issue out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5017.585s">We</a> all know that allegedly it was thrown away. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5020.666s">We</a> don't know if it was thrown away, if it was misplaced, somebody took it, somebody got rid of it, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5026.41s">The</a> police report, the police investigation will prove that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5029.912s">But</a> while all that's going on, to hire another paid outside consultant, because that person is a political personal friend of the mayor, <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5040.195s">My</a> God, come on, folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5041.597s">I</a> mean, there's got to be some checks and balances here. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5045.842s">It</a> can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5046.163s">If</a> it looks like a duck and walks like a duck and smells like a duck, it probably is. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5049.647s">Chapter</a> 268A, that's what it says. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5052.03s">You</a> can't give the appearance. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5053.532s">And</a> this definitely not only gives the <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5056.556s">You've</a> got the $1,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5057.697s">You've</a> got the contributions. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5059.377s">And</a> she's not only contributed to this mayor, she's contributed to other mayors and other people in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5065.5s">You</a> can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5066.721s">That's</a> not being independent. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5069.122s">That's</a> saying pay to play. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5071.303s">And</a> if that's what's going to go on here, then shame on this city and shame on elected officials for allowing this to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5077.026s">And</a> I would hope Mrs. Coakley would give a second thought about this and say, well, while it was nice to be asked, I think it would be better for the city of Medford to find someone <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5086.35s">who</a> has absolutely no connections if they really want to do an independent policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5090.596s">You</a> folks are all part of the Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5092.418s">Municipal</a> Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5093.419s">They</a> have a huge department in there to review personnel purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5096.964s">You</a> pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5097.705s">You're</a> a paying member on an annual basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5100.148s">You</a> should have gone to them first. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5102.393s">But</a> to turn around in this situation and disguise it because of what happened with the ammo clip and go out there and hire a Methodist lawyer from one of the most expensive law firms in Boston, and you don't even know what it's going to cost you, it makes no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5118.5s">I</a> would hope one of you somewhere along here puts a request in to have a report as to how and why she was hired, how much is she getting, and if, in fact, this is a conflict of interest.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5939.413s">If</a> it's hearsay, never mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5944.395s">Can</a> I ask you to amend the resolution that reads, well, maybe you don't like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5950.456s">You</a> can leave if you're bored. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5952.777s">Maybe</a> you can ask the question that <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5955.815s">You're</a> concerned about the ethics of it because of the fact of the financial contributions she has made to the mayor, and that in and of itself presents a conflict of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5966.517s">The</a> appearance of a conflict of interest, that's what 268A says. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5973.018s">That's</a> what we're asking for.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=6079.932s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=6080.813s">Mr.</a> President, just as a point of reference, on February 23rd it was written in the Boston Herald and where the mayor is quoted as saying that Martha Coakley is now an employee being hired.<h2><a href="../2017-10-31_hcZI56w1erc/2017-10-31_hcZI56w1erc.html">Medford, MA City Council - Oct. 31, 2017 [Livestream] (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4700.656s">Name</a> and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4707.421s">My</a> name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, former member of the Saga's party. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4712.095s">I'm</a> going to piggyback on what Cheryl talked about, but I'm more to the process more than anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4717.72s">Um,</a> this was a, the September meeting of the board of appeals was continued to the October meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4722.744s">And</a> once the meeting was continued to the October meeting, um, it was noticed out that the some of all Alderman didn't have enough time, um, to prepare what he needed to prepare. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4732.032s">So</a> he wanted to be allowed to speak in the October meeting for which he was, I believe four of members of the council were there, expressed their opinion that the members, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4740.731s">They</a> had received emails and telephone calls regarding folks that weren't notified, did not get the notice, and they just heard about it on this particular night, and they rushed down there to come to this October meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4751.1s">It</a> was at the discretion of the chairman of the board, Mr. Carman, who indicated that public comment was closed because the September meeting had come and gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4762.029s">Now,</a> that's not particularly correct either. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4766.613s">The</a> meeting was continued, and when the meeting was continued, <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4769.911s">At</a> the time when the chairman asked for a raise of hands, those who might be opposed, and I believe he said, let the record say there were 10, at that point he opened up that meeting for public participation by the raise of the hands, because he noticed it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4784.739s">He</a> also said that they couldn't speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4786.88s">Well,</a> if you're asking for their participation by raising their hands, but they couldn't speak, you really don't know the reason why they were opposing it, because maybe they would have been convinced <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4797.814s">that</a> they would be far if they wanted to get their particular point across, which unfortunately I never had. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4803.641s">So</a> then you go to four particular issues that I think were really prevalent at that particular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4812.17s">The</a> first one was <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4814.083s">The</a> zoning on parking spaces, Somerville and Medford are very different. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4817.665s">Somerville</a> has 1.0 per parking unit, Medford has 2.1. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4822.127s">No</a> discussion on that at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4824.027s">The</a> next issue was the sun being blocked on the streets that are abutting this particular project. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4830.39s">It's</a> a legitimate concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4831.571s">You</a> have the same issue here on High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4834.738s">when</a> they were building the new condominiums next to St. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4836.639s">Joseph's</a> Church. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4837.779s">And</a> there's legal cases and legal precedent. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4840.36s">If</a> someone's sunlight is being blocked by a building, and in this particular case, you're asking for variances to a particular project, which is over and beyond just a normal building, that has legal precedence. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4853.563s">Also,</a> they didn't talk about the fact that Cheryl alluded to the facts on this mixed-use piece of property that could be put together. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4862.97s">Well,</a> in the city of Medford, we do not allow for spot zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4866.211s">That's</a> one of the arguments that's taking place on Locust Street right now, the argument of a possible spot zoning issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4873.333s">That</a> didn't even have an opportunity for public discussion as it relates to the fact that, you know, is it or isn't it? <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4879.434s">So</a> the mixed use combination of mixed use of commercial and residential, beside not having its opportunity to have a conversation, did not even have its opportunity for the Board of Appeals to say, if we're going to entertain that, <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4892.037s">And</a> it's obvious that it's a mixed zone, I mean, it's a spot zone issue, which is in violation of the law or the spirit of, not the spirit, of the Massachusetts general law here in the city of Medford that's promulgated. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4903.261s">You've</a> got an issue here as it relates to the developer and what he needs to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4907.382s">Now,</a> Councilor Dello Russo alluded to the fact that the board is not political. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4910.923s">It</a> most certainly is political because all three members of the board are appointed by the mayor of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4915.925s">So</a> the request that was just made earlier by Councilor Longo relative to asking the mayor <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4921.493s">to</a> ask the board to let people speak on and beyond, over and beyond, is absolutely on target. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4928.017s">And</a> more importantly, you can say what you want about the prior Board of Appeals when Mr. Arena was the chairperson. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4933.421s">He</a> always allowed every single person to speak, never mind once, sometimes twice, because he recognized whether you agreed or disagreed with his decision, if people took the time to be there and have a conversation about the project that's before them, then let them speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4948.411s">And</a> that was not the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4951.093s">I</a> almost had the distinct honor of having the police called on me by the chairperson, because I asked him, and I begged him three separate times, would you please let the people speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4959.898s">And</a> he says, no, no, he can't, because the time has already come. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4962.759s">We've</a> already had it in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4964.62s">And</a> through his reckless act, and that's what I call it, reckless, he canceled the whole meeting, which was the last two petitioners that were on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4971.483s">They</a> didn't even have an opportunity to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4974.025s">Now,</a> the law is somewhat clear, but it's also somewhat fuzzy. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4979.647s">In</a> the open meeting law, in the guidelines promulgated by the Attorney General, it does say, it does give the distinction to the chairperson or the chair of the committee to allow people to speak at that person's discretion. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4991.535s">But</a> it also says at the very end by the Attorney General, the Attorney General encourages public bodies to allow as much public participation as time allows. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5001.661s">This</a> was eight o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5003.482s">Nobody</a> was falling asleep in this audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5005.724s">They</a> were here because for a particular purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5009.114s">as</a> much public participation as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5011.556s">And</a> for that chairperson to shut off public participation and hear what was on people's minds was wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5018.864s">This</a> same chairperson served as an alternate last year when the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Attorney General Office came in and told the Board of Appeals that they had to reopen the board because they were wrong in closing down a meeting that was in a continued meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5034.089s">Now,</a> if this Board of Appeals doesn't want to understand the law and follow the guidelines by the State's Attorney General, then maybe we need a new board. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5042.615s">Maybe</a> when you change the charter, we should have the Board of Appeals be elected instead of appointed that way there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5048.399s">Maybe</a> that would be the safest way. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5050.521s">Neighborhood</a> character and neighborhood future buildings be protected. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5054.363s">You</a> know, <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5055.585s">You</a> guys and ladies on this council, your biggest responsibility over the budget is zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5060.628s">What</a> takes place in a community by its zoning? <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5063.769s">You</a> can talk about it all you want, you can advertise it all you want, but people are saying nothing's taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5069.392s">This</a> community has changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5070.973s">You're</a> in the middle of a lawsuit, they're suing the developer on Locust Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5076.136s">You've</a> gone to Miloka Street, you've gone to Middlesex Avenue, you've gone to Salem Street, and now you're over here in South Medford on Medford Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5082.959s">And</a> one of the other arguments that were brought forth is the traffic going to be deposited onto the Medford Street, and Medford Street, as we all know, is a cut-through street to Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5092.382s">These</a> are all legitimate concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5094.783s">This</a> isn't to say whether you're for or against the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5097.504s">It's</a> the concerns that the people wanted to talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5101.265s">And</a> when you shut the people off at the pass, that's why they have no respect and they don't believe in their government. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5108.028s">And</a> that's why it's incumbent upon you as city councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5110.689s">You've</a> been talking about it for two years, about changing your zoning, and you haven't done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5114.69s">So</a> whoever of you get re-elected, you should make that your priority, along with the new members of the council, that zoning is the number one priority, because you've seen what it's doing to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5124.332s">You've</a> seen the character of neighborhoods being totally disrupted. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5128.213s">And</a> you can't say it's not political when every member on the board is appointed by a political person, and that's the mayor of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5136.26s">So</a> if you want to have clean hands and let the neighborhood and let the taxpayers make that decision, because good zoning might be predicated upon people who get elected rather than people get appointed, that might set the tone in a different direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5149.651s">And</a> just lastly, I want to say this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5152.374s">This</a> is Halloween. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5153.074s">This</a> is trick-or-treat night. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5154.636s">And</a> some of you have young children. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5156.416s">I</a> think it would have been a good call by you, Mr. President, to delay the meeting by at least an hour to let whoever had children to go out and trick or treat with their family. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5164.184s">You</a> still could have accomplished the city council meeting and we wouldn't be in the chaos that we're in right now.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5176.997s">And</a> when was that, sir?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5182.202s">I</a> believe you have 48 hours to change that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5184.083s">You've</a> had that since last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5185.784s">But</a> other than that, I'd be more than happy to answer any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5188.066s">But</a> how do you say it? <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5191.728s">There</a> aren't too many things that you guys and girls really have super control over. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5197.091s">Budget,</a> voting it up and down, but zoning, it's all yours. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5200.313s">You</a> own it, lock, stock, and barrel. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5202.734s">Use</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5203.815s">Don't</a> let the administration abuse it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5205.876s">You</a> guys and girls use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5208.148s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6108.577s">Just</a> as a further point, just as a further point. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6113.499s">Now,</a> I can appreciate the developer coming here to make the comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6116.6s">But</a> these comments were not made at the public hearing, for which a whole bunch of people, almost 100 in total, were here on that night, whether they were from Somerville or from Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6125.543s">Arguing</a> the case here tonight with only a few of the residents is not the right way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6131.025s">The</a> issue on the sun, the issue on the barrels, that's all well and good. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6134.526s">But</a> we have four people here right now that have never heard it for the first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6138.127s">You</a> folks have taken it upon yourself to bring a suit against a developer on Locust Street because you were dissatisfied because the neighborhood was not addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6147.244s">Four</a> of you just attended this past meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6149.841s">this</a> past October 24th meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6151.763s">I</a> would strongly suggest that the four of you, if not seven of you, make a request to the Board of Appeals to ask them to delay any finality to making a decision and to reopen a public hearing to listen to all the stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6165.874s">Because</a> it's obvious that they didn't have a chance to listen to the people.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6174.141s">No,</a> he can have all the meetings he's want. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6176.322s">I'm</a> talking about the Board of Appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6178.604s">As</a> Mrs. Rodriguez just said, they're scheduled to make a final determination first week in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6185.308s">There</a> are two official complaints being filed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6187.77s">And</a> if they don't respond to them, it goes to the Attorney General's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6191.092s">Now,</a> do you really want to go that far? <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6193.534s">Or</a> we can resolve it by maybe having the board, seven of you, respectfully request the Board of Appeals to delay any further action and to reopen.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2122.993s">Robert</a> Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford Mass, former member of this August body. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2129.818s">I</a> come here to address the City Council on this important issue that has important but different consequences depending on what side of the issue that you might be on. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2142.287s">At</a> the outset, I want to address and thank Curtis Tooden for propelling this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2147.877s">before</a> our citizens of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2150.559s">Since</a> this is an election year and we're all running for office, those of you that are and those that might be candidates running for office, boasting about all the wonderful accomplishments and the hard votes that you had to take. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2163.325s">To</a> me, this is a very important issue and I think it's an issue that needs to be presented and discussed and to have everybody, including the mayor, the city council and the school committee take a position on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2173.609s">Because</a> isn't it weird, when we think about our America today and you see all the things that are taking place, whether it's before the National Football League or Little Pop Wanna Kids, the use of our American flag, the national anthem, seems to be at issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2191.897s">And</a> our culture seems to be at issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2195.518s">But</a> where are we going with all of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2197.559s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2198.379s">You</a> know, Sanctuary City's had its beginning here in the United States back in the 1980s. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2202.941s">Central</a> folks, central people from Central America left their country looking for political refuge because of the oppressive nature that was taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2213.107s">And</a> what took place here in this country, and the churches, many of the churches throughout this country, they took these folks in, believing them to be in need of help, and for which we did, we helped them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2225.964s">But</a> that sort of like has morphed itself since 1981 to what it is today, addressing itself to sanctuary cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2235.111s">And</a> as a result of sanctuary cities becoming what they are and having a different interpretation, you, Mr. President, just read something that was dated November 21, 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2247.861s">If</a> you go to that third whereas, it says the city of Medford stands in support of all immigrant groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2253.666s">I</a> think the word before all <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2255.939s">an</a> immigrant should be legal. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2257.9s">All</a> legal immigrant groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2260.16s">Because</a> we, the people of the United States, are a nation built on laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2265.642s">Its</a> foundation is built on laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2268.123s">And</a> it's on the legality of what we do each and every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2271.664s">And</a> it seems, and it seems that because of all this illegal immigration that is taking place in this country, you know, have we as a country now forgotten the fact or gotten to the point where everybody has a right <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2285.282s">We're</a> giving everybody rights, but nobody wants responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2289.623s">But</a> the responsibility that's being borne each and every day is the Mr. and Mrs. America, Mr. and Mrs. Medford Taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2297.265s">You</a> know, I cannot think of any prouder comment than something that's written on the banner of the VFW of Mystic Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2308.728s">It</a> says, all lives matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2312.441s">Everybody's</a> lives matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2314.743s">White,</a> black, blue, green. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2315.944s">I</a> don't care what nationality you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2318.586s">If</a> you're here in this country and you're here legally or you have the proper legal documents earning your way to become an American citizen, your life matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2327.973s">And</a> for those folks that come here illegally, that's in and of itself the question that's before us right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2335.459s">You</a> know, <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2336.713s">We</a> as a community are very generous to so many people. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2340.515s">You</a> members on the council, especially your two new members, Councilor Scarpel and Councilor Falco, you've just gone through two years of community block grant funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2347.998s">And</a> if you go through each and every one of those community block grant fundings, you will see the amount of money that's been dedicated and prioritized to charities within not only the city of Medford, but in the Tri-City and outside the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2362.224s">You've</a> also seen monies go to legal, council, <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2366.36s">for</a> people who have an illegal immigration condition needing to get itself resolved and coming forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2375.302s">We</a> also have in this community all our churches and all the food pantries and the shelters taking care of as many people as they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2384.383s">And</a> while they're doing that, the question then becomes, who comes first, the illegal or the legal? <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2392.564s">And</a> I think a sanctuary city, in and of itself, <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2396.383s">presents</a> that particular situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2398.684s">Like</a> I said, again, depending on what side of the issue you're on. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2403.127s">Sanctuary</a> cities throughout this country, and there's 200 of them right now, that bar the use of government resources to enforce federal immigration laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2413.133s">And</a> they also allow illegals charged with crimes to be released without notifying federal authorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2420.918s">Now,</a> in a report that was submitted in December of 2014 to Congress, <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2425.754s">It</a> stated that more than 30,000 convicted criminals have been released by ICE at the end of 2014, and they have gone back to the states, to the cities and towns that they came from. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2438.123s">But</a> inclusive of those crimes, there was 173 homicides, there were 373 sexual assaults, there were 186 kidnappings, and there was 1,000, excuse me, there was 14,014 <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2456.055s">drunk</a> driving charges to individuals that did not have a license. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2460.597s">There</a> were more than 30,000 convicted criminal citations issued during that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2468.18s">What</a> does that say to the law abiding citizen? <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2471.002s">But</a> more importantly, what does that say to law enforcement personnel? <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2477.79s">who</a> especially now, if you're in a sanctuary city, you can't ask for identification as to are you an immigrant or not, you can't hold them, you can't call ISIS, excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2491.159s">It</a> has a ramification that just really says to the police officer of today, beside doing my job for the city that I'm in, I am now having to become aware of somebody who might be here illegally. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2506.499s">And</a> that person might get preferential treatment over someone who might be illegally, but that I can arrest and imprison. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2514.081s">And</a> that's really not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2516.701s">There's</a> a particular case that takes place from a gentleman and his two children that died. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2522.762s">He</a> came from Lavon, Texas. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2525.223s">And</a> he was hit by an illegal immigrant who hit him head on in a collision. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2530.244s">And</a> he killed him, his four-year-old son, and his 22-month-old <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2535.14s">striped</a> out his four-year-old daughter and his 22-year-old son. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2539.102s">The</a> illegal person was arrested and plea bargained to a two-year sentence, a two-year sentence for wiping out a husband, a father, and a daughter. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2553.508s">The</a> woman subsequent to that has had some kind of public, how could you say, retaliation <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2562.588s">because</a> she felt that the justice system didn't do her right, because she complained because of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2568.753s">And</a> the person that killed her husband, her daughter, and her son was Hispanic. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2572.396s">She</a> now becomes the culprit and not the victim. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2576.579s">These</a> are just little nuances. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2578.34s">We</a> can go to the entire country. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2580.442s">There</a> are cases where police officers have been killed, shot, brutally murdered by illegal immigrants here in this country. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2588.408s">And</a> that's not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2589.469s">Absolutely</a> not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2592.469s">When</a> we think about what's going on, illegals, they have the benefits of our free medical system. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2599.152s">They</a> go to our quality schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2601.433s">They</a> get free housing and free food. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2603.694s">But</a> they don't choose to blend in by learning English and assimilating to our American culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2610.938s">And</a> further, by committing crimes outside or inside the community or the state that they're in, <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2618.539s">It</a> adds a definite cost to our police, to our public safety, to our public education, and to Mr. and Mrs. Medford and Mr. and Mrs. America. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2629.225s">So</a> the question then becomes, on a sanctuary city, you folks are running for office. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2634.708s">I</a> haven't seen one of you yet say or put anywhere in your literature, just one gentleman so far, he's in the back of the room, made the point that he is for sanctuary cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2646.235s">I</a> commend him for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2647.255s">He</a> took his position. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2649.369s">It's</a> a very important issue to be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2654.07s">Because</a> if you're telling me that you're abiding by this November 16th, strike that, November 23rd resolution, well this smacks of all the ingredients of a sanctuary city. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2667.254s">Either</a> we are or we're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2670.415s">And</a> I think you Councilors and every candidate running for office needs to take that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2675.757s">And</a> the reason why they need to take that position, whether you're for or against, <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2680.441s">in</a> a common, level-headed society, while we don't have to agree, we can respectfully disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2687.861s">And</a> that's where I think we need to be going here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2691.622s">You</a> know, when you say we're a welcoming community, as a matter of fact, there's a billboard coming in on Route 93. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2697.483s">It</a> says we are a welcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2698.984s">We've</a> always been a welcoming committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2700.764s">We've</a> got the third largest black population in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and we've had it for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2707.426s">And</a> slowly but surely, they're leaving because nobody can afford to stay there anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2711.227s">The</a> cost of housing in this community has gone completely out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2714.968s">Makes</a> no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2716.977s">And</a> if this present administration keeps wanting to put housing all over the place, and if this council doesn't want to review zoning, that's what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2724.681s">You</a> can have a city so out of control, you're not going to be able to understand what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2728.583s">And</a> Dr. Stirella was right. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2730.104s">Your</a> finances will be so out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2732.765s">And</a> if you add a sanctuary city to the mix, then please explain why you're doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2738.508s">And</a> please let the people know as a candidate for office, that a sanctuary city, you're either for it or against it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2757.509s">I</a> think the bottom line, my comment would basically, I don't think any city council, any mayor, any school committee person or anyone, <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2766.741s">should</a> tell a police department how to do their job, especially whether they're legal or illegal. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2773.389s">That's</a> their job to protect and to serve, and not to be controlled by a political hierarchy in a community that turns around and says, we want to be a sanctuary city.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5041.629s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5041.949s">Robert</a> Penteciro, Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5045.05s">First</a> of all, for the young lady behind me, I'm not a white privileged individual. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5052.355s">Had</a> to work for everything in my life, starting at five o'clock in the morning for eight consecutive years, driving a canteen truck, being held up three times, shot at twice. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5063.944s">But</a> I didn't give up because I knew what I wanted to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5067.326s">I</a> wanted to get a college education and go forward with my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5071.65s">And</a> that's what I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5072.891s">I</a> did not come here tonight to be decisive or have people become decisive. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5079.556s">I</a> came here tonight to present an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5081.707s">thanking</a> Mr. Tudin, who made the acknowledgement that he is for a sanctuary city. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5087.763s">It's</a> a subject matter that needs to be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5091.257s">The</a> statistics that were given are actual statistics. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5094.859s">You</a> can't get away, because they're not lying. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5097.921s">And</a> for the other lady who indicated that the crime rate for the individuals who are undocumented are less than regular American citizens that are documented and are legal, that in and of itself spells to the question of the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5114.511s">They're</a> doing more work because they have to deal with undocumented illegals over and beyond their regular course. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5122.235s">Now,</a> are all of them bad people? <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5124.736s">Absolutely</a> not. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5125.936s">Do</a> they deserve a fair shot? <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5128.278s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5130.359s">And</a> if they have to have some political intervention, which is taking place right now in Washington, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5136.341s">But</a> the fact of the matter is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5138.601s">I</a> stand here and I resent the fact that anyone, any seven of you or anyone in this audience, who wants to turn around and say, because I was born white, that I am privileged, that is false, that is wrong, and that is a lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5151.525s">And</a> you should be ashamed of yourself for saying that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5154.346s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2017-10-17_c7aHV1_-sJM/2017-10-17_c7aHV1_-sJM.html">Medford, MA City Council - Oct. 17, 2017 [Livestream] (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2806.831s">Robert</a> Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of this August body. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2813.676s">I</a> come here to address the City Council on this important issue that has important but different consequences depending on what side of the issue that you might be on. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2826.145s">At</a> the outset, I want to address and thank Curtis Tudin for propelling this issue <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2831.714s">before</a> our citizens of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2834.415s">Since</a> this is an election year and we're all running for office, those of you that are and those that might be candidates running for office, boasting about all the wonderful accomplishments and the hard votes that you had to take. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2847.181s">To</a> me, this is a very important issue and I think it's an issue that needs to be presented and discussed and to have everybody, including the mayor, the city council, the school committee, take a position on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2857.449s">Because</a> isn't it weird, when we think about our America today, and you see all the things that are taking place, whether it's before the National Football League, or little Pop Warner kids, the use of our American flag, the national anthem, seems to be at issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2875.734s">And</a> our culture seems to be at issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2879.355s">But</a> where are we going with all of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2881.396s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2882.496s">Sanctuary</a> City's had its beginning here in the United States back in the 1980s. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2886.778s">Central</a> folks, central people from Central America left their country looking for political refuge because of the oppressive nature that was taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2896.962s">And</a> what took place here in this country, and the churches, many of the churches throughout this country, they took these folks in, believing them to be in need of help, and for which we did, we helped them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2909.821s">But</a> that sort of like has morphed itself since 1981 to what it is today, addressing itself to sanctuary cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2918.967s">And</a> as a result of sanctuary cities becoming what they are and having a different interpretation, you, Mr. President, just read something that was dated November 21, 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2931.756s">If</a> you go to that third whereas, it says the city of Medford stands in support of all immigrant groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2937.7s">I</a> think the word before all, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2939.83s">an</a> immigrant should be legal. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2941.791s">All</a> legal immigrant groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2944.051s">Because</a> we, the people of the United States, are a nation built on laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2949.533s">Its</a> foundation is built on laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2952.014s">And</a> it's on the legality of what we do each and every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2955.535s">And</a> it seems, and it seems that because of all this illegal immigration that is taking place in this country, you know, have we as a country now forgotten the fact or gotten to the point where everybody has a right <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2969.155s">We're</a> giving everybody rights, but nobody wants responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2973.497s">But</a> the responsibility that's being borne each and every day is the Mr. and Mrs. America, Mr. and Mrs. Medford taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2981.141s">You</a> know, I cannot think of any prouder comment than something that's written on the banner of the VFW of Mystic Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2992.607s">It</a> says, all lives matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2996.315s">Everybody's</a> lives matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2998.617s">White,</a> black, blue, green, I don't care what nationality you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3002.46s">If</a> you're here in this country, and you're here legally, or you have the proper legal documents, earning your way to become an American citizen, your life matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3011.847s">And</a> for those folks that come here illegally, that's in and of itself the question that's before us right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3020.586s">We</a> as a community are very generous to so many people. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3024.389s">You</a> members on the council, especially your two new members, Councilor Scarpel and Councilor Falco, you've just gone through two years of community block grant funding, and if you go through each and every one of those community block grant fundings, you will see the amount of money that's been dedicated and prioritized to charities within not only the city of Medford, but in the Tri-City and outside the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3046.085s">You've</a> also seen monies go to legal, council, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3050.216s">for</a> people who have an illegal immigration condition needing to get itself resolved and coming forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3059.158s">We</a> also have in this community all our churches and all the food pantries and the shelters taking care of as many people as they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3068.241s">And</a> while they're doing that, the question then becomes, who comes first, the illegal or the legal? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3076.423s">And</a> I think a sanctuary city, in and of itself, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3080.219s">presents</a> that particular situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3082.541s">Like</a> I said, again, depending on what side of the issue you're on. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3086.983s">Sanctuary</a> cities throughout this country, and there's 200 of them right now, that bar the use of government resources to enforce federal immigration laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3096.99s">And</a> they also allow illegals charged with crimes to be released without notifying federal authorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3104.775s">Now,</a> in a report that was submitted in December of 2014 to Congress, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3109.591s">It</a> stated that more than 30,000 convicted criminals have been released by ICE at the end of 2014, and they have gone back to the states, to the cities and towns that they came from. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3122.019s">But</a> inclusive of those crimes, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3125.196s">There</a> was 173 homicides, there were 373 sexual assaults, there were 186 kidnappings, and there was 1,000, excuse me, there was 14,014 drunk driving charges to individuals that did not have a license. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3131.558s">There</a> were more than 30,000 convicted criminal citations issued during that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3152.065s">What</a> does that say to the law abiding citizen? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3154.887s">But</a> more importantly, what does that say to law enforcement personnel? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3161.69s">Who</a> especially now, if you're in a sanctuary city, you can't ask for identification as to are you an immigrant or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3169.214s">You</a> can't hold them, you can't call ISIS, excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3175.064s">It</a> has a ramification that just really says to the police officer of today, beside doing my job for the city that I'm in, I am now having to become aware of somebody who might be here illegally. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3190.393s">And</a> that person might get preferential treatment over someone who might be here legally, but that I can arrest and imprison. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3197.977s">And</a> that's really not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3200.609s">There's</a> a particular case that takes place from a gentleman and his two children that died. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3206.651s">He</a> came from Levone, Texas. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3209.112s">And</a> he was hit by an illegal immigrant who hit him head on in a collision. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3214.134s">And</a> he killed him, his four-year-old son, and his 22-month-old, strike that, his four-year-old daughter and his 22-month-old son. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3223.017s">The</a> illegal person was arrested and plea bargained to a two-year sentence. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3231.283s">a</a> two-year sentence for wiping out a husband, a father, and a daughter. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3237.404s">The</a> woman, subsequent to that, has had some kind of public, how could you say, retaliation, because she felt that the justice system didn't do her right, because she complained because of that, and the person that killed her husband, her daughter, and her son was Hispanic, she now becomes the culprit and not the victim. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3260.455s">These</a> are just little nuances. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3262.236s">We</a> can go to the entire country. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3264.318s">There</a> are cases where police officers have been killed, shot, brutally murdered by illegal immigrants here in this country. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3272.303s">And</a> that's not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3273.364s">Absolutely</a> not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3276.386s">When</a> we think about what's going on, illegals, they have the benefits of our free medical system. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3283.071s">They</a> go to our quality schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3285.352s">They</a> get free housing and free food. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3287.614s">But</a> they don't choose to blend in <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3289.653s">by</a> learning English and assimilating to our American culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3294.835s">And</a> further, by committing crimes outside or inside the community or the state that they're in, it adds a definite cost to our police, to our public safety, to our public education, and to Mr. and Mrs. Medford and Mr. and Mrs. America. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3313.123s">So</a> the question then becomes, on a sanctuary city, you folks are running for office. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3318.615s">I</a> haven't seen one of you yet say or put anywhere in your literature. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3322.816s">Just</a> one gentleman so far, he's in the back of the room, made the point that he is for sanctuary cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3330.099s">I</a> commend him for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3331.119s">He</a> took his position. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3333.26s">It's</a> a very important issue to be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3337.961s">Because</a> if you're telling me that you're abiding by this November 16th, strike that, November 23rd, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3346.365s">resolution,</a> well, this smacks of all the ingredients of a sanctuary city. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3351.129s">Either</a> we are or we're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3354.292s">And</a> I think you councilors and every candidate running for office needs to take that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3359.656s">And</a> the reason why they need to take that position, whether you're for or against, in a common level headed society, while we don't have to agree, we can respectfully disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3371.752s">And</a> that's where I think we need to be going here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3375.515s">You</a> know, when you say we're a welcoming community, as a matter of fact, there's a billboard coming in on Route 93. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3381.379s">It</a> says we are a welcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3382.88s">We've</a> always been a welcoming committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3384.661s">We've</a> got the third largest black population in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and we've had it for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3391.326s">And</a> slowly but surely, they're leaving because nobody can afford to stay there anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3395.129s">The</a> cost of housing in this community has gone completely out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3398.872s">Makes</a> no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3400.868s">And</a> if this present administration keeps wanting to put housing all over the place, and if this council doesn't want to review zoning, that's what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3408.572s">You</a> can have a city so out of control, you're not going to be able to understand what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3412.474s">And</a> Dr. Stirella was right. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3413.995s">Your</a> finances will be so out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3416.656s">And</a> if you add a sanctuary city to the mix, then please explain why you're doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3422.399s">And</a> please let the people know as a candidate for office that a sanctuary city, you're either for it or against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3428.729s">Mr.</a> Panto, we're running, you're

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3441.36s">I</a> think the bottom line, my comment would basically, I don't think any city council, any mayor, any school committee person or anyone <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3450.615s">should</a> tell a police department how to do their job, especially whether they're legal or illegal. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3457.244s">That's</a> their job to protect and to serve, and not to be controlled by a political hierarchy in a community that turns around and says, we want to be a sanctuary city.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5725.656s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5725.976s">Robert</a> Penteciro, Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5729.079s">First</a> of all, for the young lady to my behind me, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5733.038s">I'm</a> not a white privileged individual. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5735.439s">I've</a> had to work for everything in my life, starting at five o'clock in the morning for eight consecutive years, driving a canteen truck, being held up three times, shot at twice. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5747.925s">But</a> I didn't give up because I knew what I wanted to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5751.327s">I</a> wanted to get a college education and go forward with my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5755.629s">And</a> that's what I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5756.89s">I</a> did not come here tonight to be decisive or <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5762.048s">Have</a> people become decisive. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5763.531s">I</a> came here tonight to present an issue, thanking Mr. Tudin, who made the acknowledgement that he is for a sanctuary city. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5771.745s">It's</a> a subject matter that needs to be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5775.236s">The</a> statistics that were given are actual statistics. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5778.838s">You</a> can't get away because they're not lying. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5781.899s">And</a> for the other lady who indicated that the crime rate for the individuals who are undocumented are less than regular American citizens that are documented and are legal, that in and of itself spells to the question of the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5798.487s">They're</a> doing more work because they have to deal with undocumented illegals over and beyond their regular course. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5806.214s">Now,</a> are all of them bad people? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5808.696s">Absolutely</a> not. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5809.897s">Do</a> they deserve a fair shot? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5812.239s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5814.298s">And</a> if they have to have some political intervention, which is taking place right now in Washington, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5820.324s">But</a> the fact of the matter is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5822.566s">I</a> stand here and I resent the fact that anyone, any seven of you or anyone in this audience, who wants to turn around and say, because I was born white, that I am privileged, that is false, that is wrong, and that is a lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5835.519s">And</a> you should be ashamed of yourself for saying that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5838.321s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2017-10-03_iE4eK_fbeHg/2017-10-03_iE4eK_fbeHg.html">Medford, MA City Council - Oct. 3, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

<a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2151.797s">The</a> next question begs itself to City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2153.758s">Does</a> every member of City Hall, every employee need a query check because if a parent comes in there or a taxpayer comes in there with a child and the child goes to the bathroom and the child is not with the parent, <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2164.402s">and</a> there's an employee there, does that subject the city or the employee to some kind of liability of a query check?

<a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2179.534s">If</a> I understand this thing properly, if I'm a candidate for office like the seven of you are, a candidate for office, and if you come in here, supposedly you don't need a query check, but if you submit your <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2191.867s">take</a> a desk by mail when you need a query check, or can you come in at any time, even though you're independent of your role as a Councilor being here tonight, walk around the building, and for that purpose, do you need a query check? <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2203.216s">Do</a> employees in this building, custodians in this building, do they need a query check as it relates to their interaction with students? <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2209.701s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2210.121s">Now,</a> I understand that teachers, when they come on board, there's a query check sign on them, I understand all of that, but I don't know the nuances about everyone, contractors, <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2219.128s">And</a> I think we had here a couple of weeks ago, there was a gentleman come up, said he was putting lights in a certain part of the building, and in their second shift the question was asked, they said that they would be getting a query checked. <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2229.151s">Okay,</a> that's all well and good. <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2230.731s">But</a> I'd like to, I know the solicitor's here, but I'd like to have the council have a report that comes out that basically said, <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2237.313s">How</a> is a query check going to be implemented? <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2240.755s">And</a> more importantly, if a taxpayer citizen wants to come up, work this room, submit a tape, does that taxpayer citizen have to be query checked or not? <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2249.5s">I</a> mean, because don't forget, this whole idea of public access was just what it's for, public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2254.703s">And</a> if it was in any other location but this place here, I don't think we would be talking about a query check. <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2259.846s">But</a> I understand that this has its own entrance, its own locks, and it's separate from the main entrance of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2265.742s">And</a> I believe that in and of itself should probably give some credence that a query check is not needed, however this room is being used. <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2272.47s">So</a> I think we need some clarification to finalize this thing and we can move on with an election which is right around the corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2278.798s">And</a> let me just say this one last thing about the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2281.14s">It's</a> a damn shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2282.502s">It's</a> a damn shame, and I use the word damn shame, that this room and the access used for this was not in place prior to the primary election where all the candidates, incumbents, would have had an opportunity to come and make their presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2295.789s">This</a> unfortunately seems to be at a last minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2297.95s">It's</a> a quick ploy to get itself in. <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2299.851s">You've</a> got your notices. <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2301.692s">The</a> last one is tomorrow or the next day this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2304.014s">It's</a> sort of like- I think they've extended the schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2306.735s">They've</a> extended the schedule, but it's a little bit unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2308.897s">You</a> know, this has been running around for a long period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2311.46s">They</a> had $650,000 of taxpayers' money from Verizon and Comcast that was used to put this building together. <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2318.827s">This</a> has been taking place for a long period of time, and I think it's just a little bit unfair, and especially when the rules are inconsistent right now, I think that's what we need to know, whether you're an incumbent or a newcomer running for this office. <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2331.739s">So,</a> I would say before you take it and receive it and place it on file, I think those questions should be answered before you take that and receive it and place it on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2341.003s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1806.782s">Robert</a> Penta, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass, former member of the Saugus Party. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1812.243s">I</a> present this to you, and I believe all of you got a copy of, that's a three-page document that was mailed out early this summer, pursuant to the request of Councilwoman McCurran to explain the rationale behind having a local option filing piece of legislation regarding <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1832.004s">Community</a> Preservation Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1833.785s">When</a> this Community Preservation Act was being sold to the folks here in the city of Medford, they were passing out pieces of literature such as this, talked about the Community Preservation Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1843.187s">And</a> on the back it says, communities submit annual reports to the state before receiving matching funds to ensure funds are properly spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1852.99s">Matching</a> funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1854.871s">In</a> 2002, which was the first year of the Community Preservation Act, <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1858.525s">For</a> the first six years, cities and towns got 100% of their monies. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1863.41s">And</a> at that point in time, there was 113 communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1867.333s">Now,</a> in 2015, when the city of Medford voted for it, there's 156 communities, and all we're getting back this year is approximately 14.5%. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1876.342s">And</a> it's up to 178 communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1882.14s">The</a> problem that's existing, speaking to these communities, and a lot of the folks, these legislators in these communities, are beginning to realize now that the tax, the CPA tax, the community preservation tax that people are paying for is not being matched by the Commonwealth of Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1898.846s">We</a> voted for this in 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1901.509s">Its</a> first year of payment is now coming to us in 2017, this November. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1906.954s">That's</a> approximately $180,000, and we, the committee, collected $1.2 million, $500,000 of taxpayers' money. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1916.283s">The</a> legislation that I'm proposing is not to abolish the CPA, but rather to make it fair and equitable <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1923.545s">for</a> the folks who voted for it, and especially for the people of Medford who believed, when they voted for this, that the Commonwealth was going to match dollar for dollar through the trust fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1933.347s">And</a> how it's being proposed right now is when you go to the Registry of Deeds, and whether it's a municipal lien or a tax on your real estate deeds, it's $10 or $20. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1941.289s">What</a> they're thinking right now is doubling it, and that would constitute another tax on people who buy and sell property. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1950.151s">But</a> putting that aside, until that happens, <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1952.71s">It</a> was 2013 when it was then Governor DeVal Patrick who took $20 million, I believe, $25 million from the surplus money of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts just to meet the bare bones minimum of monies to go back to cities and towns in 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1970.16s">it</a> was approximately 52% of the monies went back to the cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1974.522s">We're</a> down now to 14%. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1976.643s">And</a> the law says the state cannot go any lower than 5%, which is sort of like outrageous because you're gonna keep taxing taxpayers in this community for something that's not being met. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1987.948s">People</a> believed when they voted for the Community Preservation Act that the Commonwealth of Mass would match that dollar for dollar, it was advertised as such, and it was stated as such. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1998.122s">The</a> two exceptions that I'm asking you folks to consider, and if you don't wanna vote on it tonight, that's all right, but I would appreciate it at least going to the city solicitor for the purposes of the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2008.59s">I'm</a> asking that there be a hold on the city going further on collecting any monies from taxpayers under the CPA Community Preservation Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2017.916s">Because</a> right now, it's not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2019.617s">You're</a> telling the taxpayer that they have being taxed at 1.5% of their real estate value minus the first $100,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2028.322s">but</a> at the same time they're not going to be getting that dollar amount from the trust fund, from the Commonwealth of Mass Bath. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2033.004s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2034.405s">Number</a> two, the second part of the resolve is that this is a five-year commitment as you know, and it automatically renews itself after five years, unless there's a legislative question on the ballot not to renew it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2047.363s">This</a> second option is to have it go on the ballot automatically to renew it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2052.607s">So</a> it dies, it's like sunset legislation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2054.989s">It</a> just dies at the end of five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2057.33s">And</a> if the community still wants to have it and they wanna go forward with it, they put it back on the ballot once again and the people can vote for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2064.375s">I</a> don't think it's anything that's detrimental to this community other than the fact you're gonna keep taxing rate payers in this community for something they're not getting their money's worth for and they're not getting the match for. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2074.843s">And</a> this greatly will impede <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2076.942s">This</a> will greatly impede the concerns and the issues, whether it be for parks, historical pieces of property, low income housing, whatever the decision might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2086.672s">Plus</a> the fact, I believe, that they're paying somebody approximately $65,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2088.814s">Mr.</a> Pender, can I see that card? <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2090.136s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2098.801s">I</a> believe approximately right now somebody's getting paid, I believe if I understood when this came out a couple of months ago, somebody's gonna be paid approximately $65,000, $62,000, $149,000, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2106.926s">So</a> we've collected $1,242,974. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2114.811s">from</a> the Medford taxpayers in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2117.195s">But</a> all you're getting back from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is approximately $180,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2119.918s">That's</a> not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2122.462s">That's</a> not the way this was supposed to be going. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2124.525s">And</a> now with more people coming on board, there's now 176 people applying for these monies from the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2133.054s">and</a> having to go to the Registry of Deeds to double increase the taxes for municipal liens and for deed stamps that goes on our recordings, that's not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2144.824s">Just</a> to meet the bare bones minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2147.826s">This</a> year it's only 14%. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2149.147s">It</a> was reported in the local press earlier this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2151.93s">You</a> call the state house, they'll tell you the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2154.412s">And</a> you call, for which I had a long extensive conversation with the people in Boston, is call the CPA, <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2162.727s">in</a> Boston, their research people. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2166.89s">This</a> is not, this is not to say I or anyone opposed to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2172.415s">What</a> I'm opposed to is the inequity that this is now presented here within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2177.399s">And</a> this inequity is not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2179.601s">Because</a> people are believing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2181.795s">If</a> you're only given $180,000 back on the $1.24 million, well, all we're asking to do is to put this on hold. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2189.617s">Metro</a> taxpayers do not have to pay for this until such time that the Commonwealth meets its obligation for the purposes of giving the reimbursement. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2197.859s">That's</a> what sold this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2199.719s">That's</a> what people voted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2201.179s">And</a> that's what they believed that they were getting, a match from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2204.78s">And</a> unfortunately, it's not existing, and it's not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2208.587s">That</a> should have been told, that should have been explained. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2210.347s">And</a> I think, Mr. Clerk, you can attest to the fact over 1,200 people never turned their ballot over in 2015 to vote yes or no on the question itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2218.73s">So</a> whether the people were not informed properly when they went to vote, or they just didn't want to vote, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2224.331s">But</a> that's an awful lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2225.611s">And</a> I just think it takes into the serious consideration of today, hard times, people, water connectivity fee, water and sewer taxes, your tax rate keeps going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2236.727s">new</a> police station, new fire station, a library. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2240.651s">Where</a> is this money coming from? <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2242.032s">And</a> it's the most unfair way to go out and tax somebody right now on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2246.776s">This</a> is a state issue for which people went on <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2250.018s">I</a> believe that this would be one way to at least mitigate until the Commonwealth of Mass gets its act together, either they're going to give the 100 percent back or they're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2259.067s">Why</a> should you deal with the idea that we'll—we guarantee 5 percent because that's what the law says? <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2263.531s">Well,</a> what's 5 percent? <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2264.652s">That's</a> meaningless. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2266.334s">That</a> is stupid. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2268.155s">I'm</a> more than happy to answer any questions.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2299.894s">With</a> all due respect, Rick, I have a folder here, and if you want to, I'll go over it with you, okay?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2306.003s">This</a> first came across the city council in 1991, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2310.85s">And</a> in 1991, when this came out, when it became part of its first proposal, I think the then-Method City Council <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2316.938s">did</a> not want to entertain it at the time because they felt it was another tax on the people, unfairly hitting them without having a say. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2324.565s">And</a> you only can put it in those four particular areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2327.027s">Right</a> now, okay, the people voted for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2328.808s">We</a> accept that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2329.469s">I</a> got no problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2331.01s">But</a> how do you continue to go forward and tax the people when you're not even getting the money back? <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2335.294s">You're</a> not even getting 50% of it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2336.275s">You're</a> only getting 14.5% of the money back. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2337.776s">It's</a> totally unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2342.32s">And</a> if you go to these other cities and towns and you talk to them like I have, a lot of them are not realizing it until you go in there and you start reading the information that they have there and how it's broken down. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2351.912s">And</a> I got volumes on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2353.854s">I</a> don't sit home and read this for my health. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2355.716s">I'm</a> concerned about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2356.958s">I</a> think it's an end run on Proposition 2.5. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2359.041s">If</a> you continue to tax the people, <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2361.845s">at</a> the way you're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2363.305s">This</a> is an alternative. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2365.066s">It's</a> a legitimate alternative that a city and town can pose, and until such time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2370.206s">And</a> this is only good for five years, remember that, because the first year that you voted for was 15 to 16, and you had to get those numbers together, so you're not getting that money until 17. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2379.528s">So</a> the city method's only gonna get it for four of the five years on the CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2383.729s">And</a> then if it goes automatically after that, it'll be every year on and after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2387.509s">But</a> what I'm saying is at the end of the fifth year, Rick, <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2391.137s">the</a> option would be that it ends, it becomes part of sunset legislation, and if the community wants to do it again, they put it on the ballot, like they did the first time, and the people can vote it up, or they can vote it down.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2550.817s">That's</a> what I'm asking here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2552.077s">Motion</a> to sever the papers, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2554.217s">Mr.</a> President, what are the motions before us?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2577.83s">Mr.</a> Chase, I believe.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2586.992s">You</a> could go through the state delegation, but you also could go through your local legislative body. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2591.354s">That's</a> why I said a local home will petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2593.355s">I'd</a> like to make one correction. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2594.356s">I</a> said 1991. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2594.956s">It</a> was 2001 when this first came up in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2599.148s">And</a> from 2001, 2002, which was the first year, to 2007, the first five years, first six years, 100% went back to cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2608.215s">But</a> they started off at 34, and then they went to 113 cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2612.738s">The</a> next year, from 2008 going forward, you went from 127, now up to 176, and it's been downhill ever since. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2620.563s">And</a> again, we're just looking at equity, something that's fair to the Medford taxpayer, <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2627.309s">especially</a> the one that doesn't realize they're not getting it, that the state is not matching the money, as they said, and that's the term that they used. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2634.312s">They</a> were in Brooklyn when they sent it out, way back when. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2636.993s">It</a> broke down all the cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2639.294s">And</a> like I said, I would just be asking respectfully that the council either forward this to the city solicitor and ask him if this could be done, and if not, then we go to the second row asking our state legislature.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2683.353s">Right</a> in the letter it designates both sections of the law section to amend section 16a and section 16b of the sections 4 to 7 sections 3 to 7 of chapter 44 which this city accepted when they voted for the for the act in 2015.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2703.718s">The</a> legality of the law or if he would prepare legally a home rule petition that could be forwarded to our state legislators for the purposes of, again, this is not repealing it or getting rid of it, just to amend what's there until such time that the Commonwealth <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2723.489s">figures</a> out how to give us the 100% back.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2729.071s">That's</a> part of.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2733.573s">No,</a> no, that's part of the proposal, not now, not doing it right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2738.474s">Filing</a> the piece of legislation that would allow cities and towns through their local legislative body to hold back collecting until 100% and then the second part would be if this were to be accepted and voted upon.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2939.699s">If</a> you read the last sentence of my paragraph, the intent of this home rule, local option petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2945.144s">It's</a> a local option petition filed if the city of Medford feels that they would like to go forward as a local option petition for which the people would have a chance to vote on it, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2956.535s">If</a> they don't have that option, <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2958.197s">than</a> the local option, then we would take it to the legislature and have them file it for whatever the purposes might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2963.823s">I'm</a> presenting it because I really think it's sort of like unfair to tax these people, to tax our citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2971.131s">I</a> said in 2013, $25 million was taken out of the surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2973.513s">In</a> 2014, $11.4 million was taken out of the state surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2980.18s">And</a> in 2015, $10 million was taken out of the state surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2983.764s">From</a> 2016 forward, there's been no surplus and no money to be taken out, and all that's happening is people are being taxed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2990.79s">Unfairly</a> being taxed for something that they're not getting their money back on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2994.674s">It's</a> like you going to the store and buying a new suit, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2999.458s">And</a> they said it's $199, you go there, it's $300 because they didn't tell you about all the other incidentals. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3004.863s">It's</a> not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3005.863s">All</a> we're asking for is equity, fairness to this whole thing, and having an opportunity just to present it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3011.505s">Again,</a> this is not to kill it, to squash it, or anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3014.146s">It's</a> just to bring equity until such time that the Commonwealth can prove, can prove. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3018.348s">Councilor</a> Marks, you just said it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3020.409s">You</a> spoke to someone up there, and they said they created something, they can't control it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3025.13s">It's</a> a monster that's out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3026.931s">But</a> unfortunately, the ratepayers, the taxpayers, are paying for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3030.572s">And</a> that's not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3031.372s">I</a> don't believe that that is fair.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3148.701s">So</a> is Councilor Knight saying it's okay to tax the people without getting the adjust? <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3153.002s">redemption</a> for why they voted for this?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3174.175s">Is</a> Councilor Knight alleging that I'm spewing false information and that my statistics are wrong, that we're only getting 14%? <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3179.48s">Okay,</a> 14.555%.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3183.403s">Well,</a> I think you go back and listen to what he said. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3185.746s">Why</a> don't you go back and listen to it?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3192.17s">I</a> just can't believe that a board would want to continuously tax people in this room, in this community, knowing that it's wrong because the Commonwealth is not at least meeting its obligation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3204.478s">They</a> can't even get to 50%, never mind 15%. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3208.52s">It's</a> just wrong.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3216.683s">Rick,</a> it's right there on the back of the card. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3219.644s">It</a> says matching funds.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3275.965s">2015,</a> we voted, it was 29%. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3276.866s">29%,</a> oh gosh. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3278.487s">Then</a> I think it went down to 18, now it's 14, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3281.188s">Yeah,</a> it went down to 20, and now we're down to 14.5.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3786.585s">The</a> letter that you wrote from the gentleman from the CPA incorrectly states that this was a petition to apply to all cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3792.568s">It</a> was not. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3793.993s">And</a> that basically.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3797.876s">Apparently</a> you didn't translate it properly, or you didn't understand it properly.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3803.679s">But</a> apparently it was wrong because I don't want anyone to be misled to think that I'm asking this for all cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3809.503s">It</a> was just for the city of Medford, a local community home rule petition option.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=4019.059s">So</a> there's no appetite here to send this to the city solicitor for the purposes of reviewing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=4024.741s">So</a> what we're saying is just keep taxing the people.<h2><a href="../2017-09-26_3rLlhNFiQKU/2017-09-26_3rLlhNFiQKU.html">Medford, MA City Council - Sep. 26, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1666.095s">Robert</a> Penta, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass, former member of the Saugus party. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1671.557s">I</a> present this to you, and I believe all of you got a copy of, that's a three page document that was mailed out early this summer, pursuant to the request of Council Wendell Curran to explain the rationale behind having a local option filing piece of legislation regarding <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1691.317s">Community</a> Preservation Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1693.098s">When</a> this Community Preservation Act was being sold to the folks here in the city of Medford, they were passing out pieces of literature such as this, talked about the Community Preservation Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1702.48s">And</a> on the back it says, communities submit annual reports to the state before receiving matching funds to ensure funds are properly spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1712.303s">Matching</a> funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1714.184s">In</a> 2002, which was the first year of the Community Preservation Act, <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1717.838s">For</a> the first six years, cities and towns got 100% of their monies. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1722.723s">And</a> at that point in time, there was 113 communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1726.646s">Now,</a> in 2015, when the city of Medford voted for it, there's 156 communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1732.552s">And</a> all we're getting back this year is approximately 14.5%. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1735.655s">And</a> it's up to 178 communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1741.436s">The</a> problem that's existing, speaking to these communities, and a lot of the folks, these legislators in these communities, are beginning to realize now that the tax, the CPA tax, the community preservation tax that people are paying for is not being matched by the Commonwealth of Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1758.159s">We</a> voted for this in 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1760.801s">Its</a> first year of payment is now coming to us in 2017, this November. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1766.246s">That's</a> approximately $180,000, and we, the committee, collected $1.2 million, $500,000 of taxpayers' money. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1775.594s">The</a> legislation that I'm proposing is not to abolish the CPA, but rather to make it fair and equitable <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1782.858s">for</a> the folks who voted for it, and especially for the people of Medford who believed, when they voted for this, that the Commonwealth was going to match dollar for dollar through the trust fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1792.685s">And</a> how it's being proposed right now is when you go to the Registry of Deeds, and whether it's a municipal lien or a tax on your real estate deeds, it's $10 or $20. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1800.651s">What</a> they're thinking right now is doubling it, and that would constitute another tax on people who buy and sell property. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1809.497s">But</a> putting that aside, until that happens, <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1812.06s">It</a> was 2013 when it was then Governor DeVal Patrick who took $20 million, I believe, $25 million from the surplus money of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts just to meet the bare bones minimum of monies to go back to cities and towns in 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1829.507s">it</a> was approximately 52% of the monies went back to the cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1833.848s">We're</a> down now to 14%. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1835.988s">And</a> the law says the state cannot go any lower than 5%, which is sort of like outrageous because you're gonna keep taxing taxpayers in this community for something that's not being met. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1847.27s">People</a> believed when they voted for the Community Preservation Act that the Commonwealth of Mass would match that dollar for dollar, it was advertised as such, and it was stated as such. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1857.485s">The</a> two exceptions that I'm asking you folks to consider, and if you don't wanna vote on it tonight, that's all right, but I would appreciate it at least going to the city solicitor for the purposes of the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1867.927s">I'm</a> asking that there be a hold on the city going further on collecting any monies from taxpayers under the CPA Community Preservation Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1877.248s">Because</a> right now, it's not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1878.949s">You're</a> telling the taxpayer that they have being taxed at 1.5% of their real estate value minus the first $100,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1887.685s">But</a> at the same time, they're not gonna be getting that dollar amount from the trust fund, from the Commonwealth of Mass back. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1892.37s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1893.771s">Number</a> two, the second part of the resolve is that this is a five-year commitment, as you know, and it automatically renews itself after five years, unless there's a legislative question on the ballot not to renew it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1906.679s">This</a> second option is to have it go on the ballot automatically to renew it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1911.9s">So</a> it dies, it's like sunset legislation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1914.281s">It</a> just dies at the end of five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1916.621s">And</a> if the community still wants to have it and they wanna go forward with it, they put it back on the ballot once again and the people can vote for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1923.663s">I</a> don't think it's anything that's detrimental to this community other than the fact you're gonna keep taxing rate payers in this community for something they're not getting their money's worth for and they're not getting the match for. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1934.146s">And</a> this greatly will impede <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1936.272s">This</a> will greatly impede the concerns and the issues, whether it be for parks, historical pieces of property, low income housing, whatever the decision might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1946.001s">Plus</a> the fact I believe that they're paying somebody approximately $65,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1948.143s">Mr.</a> Pender, can I see that? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1949.223s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1949.464s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1958.111s">I</a> believe approximately right now somebody's getting paid, I believe if I understood when this came out a couple of months ago, somebody's gonna be paid approximately $65,000, $62,000, $149,000, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1966.26s">So</a> we've collected $1,242,974 from the Medford taxpayers in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1968.062s">But</a> all you're getting back from the Commonwealth of Mass is approximately $180,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1980.615s">That's</a> not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1981.777s">That's</a> not the way this was supposed to be going. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1983.839s">And</a> now with more people coming on board, there's now 176 people applying for these monies from the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1992.384s">and</a> having to go to the registry of deeds to double increase the taxes for municipal liens and for deed stamps that goes on our recordings, that's not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2004.15s">Just</a> to meet the bare bones minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2007.151s">This</a> year it's only 14%. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2008.472s">It</a> was reported in the local press earlier this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2011.253s">You</a> call the state house, they'll tell you the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2013.734s">And</a> you call, for which I had a long extensive conversation with the people in Boston, it's called the CPA, <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2022.057s">in</a> Boston, their research people. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2026.223s">This</a> is not, this is not to say I or anyone opposed to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2031.75s">What</a> I'm opposed to is the inequity that this is now presented here within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2036.736s">And</a> this inequity is not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2038.939s">Because</a> people are believing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2041.105s">If</a> you're only given $180,000 back on the $1.24 million, well, all we're asking to do is to put this on hold. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2048.928s">Medford</a> taxpayers do not have to pay for this until such time that the Commonwealth meets its obligation for the purposes of giving the reimbursement. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2057.192s">That's</a> what sold this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2059.032s">That's</a> what people voted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2060.473s">And</a> that's what they believed that they were getting, a match from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2064.075s">And</a> unfortunately, it's not existing, and it's not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2067.92s">That</a> should have been told, that should have been explained. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2069.661s">And</a> I think, Mr. Clerk, you can attest to the fact over 1,200 people never turned their ballot over in 2015 to vote yes or no on the question itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2078.104s">So</a> whether the people were not informed properly when they went to vote, or they just didn't want to vote, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2083.686s">But</a> that's an awful lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2084.666s">And</a> I just think it takes into the serious consideration of today, hard times, people, water connectivity fee, water and sewer taxes, your tax rate keeps going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2096.006s">new</a> police station, new fire station, a library. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2099.948s">Where</a> is this money coming from? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2101.489s">And</a> it's the most unfair way to go out and tax somebody right now on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2106.071s">This</a> is a state issue for which people went on <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2109.331s">I</a> believe that this would be one way to at least mitigate until the Commonwealth of Mass gets its act together, either they're going to give the 100% back or they're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2118.442s">Why</a> should you deal with the idea that we'll, we guarantee 5% because that's what the law says? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2122.887s">Well,</a> what's 5%? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2123.828s">That's</a> meaningless. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2125.69s">That</a> is stupid. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2127.512s">I'm</a> more than happy to answer any questions.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2159.19s">With</a> all due respect, Rick, I have a folder here, and if you want to, I'll go over it with you, okay?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2165.312s">This</a> first came across the city council in 1991, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2170.154s">And</a> in 1991, when this came out, when it became part of its first proposal, I think the then-Method City Council <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2176.276s">did</a> not want to entertain it at the time because they felt it was another tax on the people, unfairly hitting them without having a say. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2183.903s">And</a> you only can put it in those four particular areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2186.345s">Right</a> now, okay, the people voted for it, we accept that, I got no problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2190.289s">But</a> how do you continue to go forward and tax the people when you're not even getting the money back? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2194.593s">You're</a> not even getting 50% of it back, you're only getting 14.5% of the money back. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2197.075s">It's</a> totally unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2201.599s">And</a> if you go to these other cities and towns and you talk to them like I have, a lot of them are not realizing it until you go in there and you start reading the information that they have there and how it's broken down. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2211.204s">And</a> I got volumes on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2213.125s">I</a> don't sit home and read this for my health. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2215.005s">I'm</a> concerned about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2216.246s">I</a> think it's an end run on Proposition 2.5 if you continue to tax the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2221.142s">at</a> the way you're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2222.583s">This</a> is an alternative. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2224.364s">It's</a> a legitimate alternative that a city and town can pose, and until such time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2229.507s">And</a> this is only good for five years, remember that, because the first year that you voted for was 15 to 16, and you had to get those numbers together, so you're not getting that money until 17. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2238.812s">So</a> the city of Medford is only gonna get it for four of the five years on the CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2243.034s">And</a> then if it goes automatically after that, it'll be every year on and after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2246.796s">But</a> what I'm saying is at the end of the fifth year, Rick, <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2250.413s">the</a> option would be that it ends, it becomes part of sunset legislation, and if the community wants to do it again, they put it on the ballot like they did the first time, and the people can vote it up or they can vote it down.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2410.106s">That's</a> what I'm asking here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2411.367s">Motion</a> to sever the papers, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2437.129s">Mr.</a> Chase, I believe.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2446.291s">You</a> could go through the state delegation, but you also could go through your local legislative body. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2450.64s">That's</a> why I said a local home will petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2452.663s">I'd</a> like to make one correction. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2453.665s">I</a> said 1991. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2454.287s">It</a> was 2001 when this first came up in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2458.461s">And</a> from 2001, 2002, which was the first year, to 2007, the first six years, 100% went back to cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2467.528s">But</a> they started off at 34, and then they went to 113 cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2472.071s">The</a> next year, from 2008 going forward, you went from 127, now up to 176, and it's been downhill ever since. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2479.917s">And</a> again, we're just looking at equity, something that's fair to the Medford taxpayer, <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2486.636s">especially</a> the one that doesn't realize they're not getting it, that the state is not matching the money, as they said, and that's the term that they used. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2493.659s">Their</a> own booklet, when they sent it out, way back when, it broke down all the cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2498.641s">And</a> like I said, I would just be asking respectfully that the council either forward this to the city solicitor and ask him if this could be done, and if not, then we go to the second row, asking our state legislation.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2538.91s">Things</a> that you want us to present to the city solicitor asking Right in the letter it designates both sections of the law section to amend section 16 a and section 16 B of the sections 4 to 7 sections 3 to 7 of chapter 44 which this city accepted when they voted for the for the act in 2015
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2563.064s">The</a> legality of the law or if he would prepare legally a home rule petition that could be forwarded to our state legislators for the purposes of, again, this is not repealing it or getting rid of it, just to amend what's there until such time that the Commonwealth <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2582.745s">figures</a> out how to give us the 100% back.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2588.369s">That's</a> part of.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2592.873s">No,</a> no, that's part of the proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2595.054s">Not</a> now, not doing it right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2597.777s">Filing</a> the piece of legislation that would allow cities and towns through their local legislative body to hold back collecting until 100% and then the second part would be if this were to be accepted and voted upon.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2798.991s">If</a> you read the last sentence of my paragraph, the intent of this home rule, local option petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2804.432s">It's</a> a local option petition filed if the city of Medford feels that they would like to go forward as a local option petition for which the people would have a chance to vote on it, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2815.816s">If</a> they don't have that option, <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2817.497s">than</a> the local option, then we would take it to the legislature and have them file it for whatever the purposes might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2823.124s">I'm</a> presenting it because I really think it's sort of like unfair to tax these people, to tax our citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2828.772s">I</a> said in 2013, $25 million was taken out of the surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2835.39s">In</a> 2014, $11.4 million was taken out of the state surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2840.093s">And</a> in 2015, $10 million was taken out of the state surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2843.034s">From</a> 2016 forward, there's been no surplus and no money to be taken out, and all that's happening is people are being taxed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2850.078s">Unfairly</a> being taxed for something that they're not getting their money back on. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2853.94s">It's</a> like you going to the store and buying a new suit, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2858.762s">And</a> they said it's $199, you go there, it's $300 because they didn't tell you about all the other incidentals. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2864.125s">It's</a> not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2865.126s">All</a> we're asking for is equity, fairness to this whole thing, and having an opportunity just to present it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2870.768s">Again,</a> this is not to kill it, to squash it or anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2873.41s">It's</a> just to bring equity until such time that the Commonwealth can prove, can prove. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2877.612s">Councilor</a> Marks, you just said it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2879.653s">You</a> spoke to someone up there and they said they created something, they can't control it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2884.395s">It's</a> a monster that's out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2886.196s">But</a> unfortunately, the rate payers, the taxpayers are paying for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2889.818s">And</a> that's not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2890.638s">I</a> don't believe that that is fair.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3008.034s">So,</a> is Councilor Knight saying it's okay to tax the people without getting the adjustment? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3012.298s">redemption</a> for why they voted for this?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3033.46s">Is</a> Councilor Knight alleging that I'm spewing false information, and that my statistics are wrong, that we're only getting 14%, okay, 14.55%?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3042.73s">Well,</a> I think you go back and listen to what he said. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3045.319s">Why</a> don't you go back and listen to it? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3051.343s">I</a> just can't believe that a board would want to continuously tax people in this room, in this community, knowing that it's wrong because the Commonwealth is not at least meeting its obligation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3063.791s">They</a> can't even get to 50%, never mind 15%. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3067.833s">It's</a> just wrong.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3075.997s">Rick,</a> it's right there on the back of the card. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3078.978s">It</a> says matching funds.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3645.861s">The</a> letter that you wrote from the gentleman from the CPA incorrectly states that this was a petition to apply to all cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3651.844s">It</a> was not. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3653.269s">And</a> that basically... That's what he wrote back to me.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3657.151s">Apparently</a> you didn't translate it properly, or you didn't understand it properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3660.072s">I</a> kind of transparent what you said to me to make sure that I... But apparently it was wrong because I don't want anyone to be misled to think that I'm asking this for all cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3668.757s">It</a> was just for the city of Medford, a local community home rule petition option.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3878.347s">So</a> there's no appetite here to send this to the city solicitor for the purposes of reviewing? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3883.071s">So</a> what we're saying is just keep taxing the people.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14608.228s">My</a> name's Robert Pentez, Zero Summit, Rowan-Benton Mass, former member of this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14612.949s">When</a> we talk about security, again, you can walk into this building tonight, there's no security here at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14617.97s">This</a> is not the first time this has happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14620.011s">And</a> I know it's been a pet peeve of Councilman Locke's relative to the security of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14624.151s">So</a> that's number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14625.012s">Number</a> two, we had Mr. Brown come up here and talk about the father of this producer's agreement, the demarcation bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14633.634s">Have</a> you been query checked? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14636.113s">Did</a> you pass? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14637.633s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14638.834s">He</a> speaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14641.214s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14642.434s">The</a> question becomes this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14644.735s">He's</a> running the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14645.775s">He's</a> corporate checked. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14647.115s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14648.236s">But</a> I think if you ask the question of surrounding cities and towns, they don't have this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14652.157s">And</a> the question boils down to, if in fact, as the superintendent alluded to, these are unsupervised contact with students. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14664.17s">Councilor</a> Falco, you mentioned the question when we were doing the LED lights for the Andrews School, and I think the comment was that the second shift of the people in the building, they will become quarry checked, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14677.573s">So</a> if we're going to follow this train of thought, maybe you or the council should get a notice that who the people were and were they quarry checked and did they pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14686.819s">You</a> know, just making the comment is one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14689.84s">And</a> the superintendent is absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14692.56s">You</a> guys up here tonight, you shouldn't even be here because you haven't been query checked. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14697.261s">This</a> is public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14698.522s">This</a> is a Medford City Council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14700.902s">It's</a> public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14702.043s">The</a> people can see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14703.303s">They</a> can come in and they can talk the same way you can, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14708.004s">So</a> you've got to follow the same rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14710.985s">You,</a> in essence, are producing your own show, which is the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14716.627s">Now</a> when you talk about, I think it's section, I believe it's number five, it says here that the producer acknowledges that there's a possibility that the producer will have direct and unsupervised contact with children. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14730.839s">Okay,</a> we'll give you a grant to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14733.962s">But</a> if I never walk into this building and I send you something through the mail to have it played, are you gonna play it without having the quarry checked? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14749.456s">If</a> I can't answer it, I would have to go back to the city and ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14753.697s">And</a> that's where the problem begins. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14755.818s">You</a> have to go back to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14757.538s">Here's</a> the gentleman who's the manager of the station. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14759.918s">And</a> these questions should be all readily available. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14762.439s">You</a> know, there are things on here that talk about what can and cannot be played. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14767.28s">It</a> talks about, in section 4D, materials that contain bias, motivated threats, intimidation, and coercion that interfere with a person's civil rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14779.763s">Well,</a> I can attest to the fact that I was a product of the former Channel 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14786.766s">They</a> did all those things to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14789.567s">And</a> now they're putting it in here, and I'm glad to see that it's in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14792.749s">Because</a> there's a civil rights section in here for the violation of any of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14796.67s">And</a> there's also a section here as it relates to what can and cannot be shown, as it relates to obscenities, and without getting into the graphics of each and every one of the words. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14807.276s">There</a> I think you might have an issue as it relates to constitutional rights as to when and how it can be spoken and what time of the program, morning, noon, and night, it can be played. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14819.025s">There's</a> also a section here regarding you or anyone who's listening or anyone in this audience who decides to become a producer by giving something to <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14832.502s">If</a> you give them something and they lose it, they destroy it, or what have you, they're not responsible unless it was gross negligence on their part. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14841.187s">But</a> if you were to borrow something from Channel 3 and there was something wrong and some damage took place, you would be culpably liable financially and otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14852.974s">That's</a> what this agreement says, Mr. Bennett. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14861.083s">I</a> really think what you really need to ask is, there are some people who might want to just come in and say, there's a community section in here on cable television. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14871.896s">They</a> may want to come in and, I don't know what the terminology might be, they may want to show a birthday party, or they may want to show a wedding, or whatever, just a one-shot deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14881.07s">And</a> for that one shot deal, and coming in that entrance over there, not coming in at non-school hours, you're telling that person, call them a producer, that they have to get a Corby check. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14891.718s">Now</a> Councilor Marks, you're absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14893.399s">You</a> really need to know the genesis behind this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14895.24s">No</a> city and town around this has this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14898.363s">This</a> is crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14899.844s">This</a> is not making any sense at all as to go through this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14902.906s">Because</a> this is going to really stifle free speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14905.548s">This</a> is going to stifle your election coming up right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14909.195s">for</a> reelection and any new candidate running, is you're going to have to get a carving check to walk into that room, submit a tape, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14917.687s">Now,</a> you think about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14919.63s">You've</a> served all these years. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14922.482s">And</a> now you have to submit a Corby check to get into your local public access channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14927.465s">It</a> makes no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14929.227s">To</a> me, I think it's an administrative discrimination point. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14932.729s">I</a> don't think the administration has the right to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14935.931s">I</a> think the city solicitor needs to come and present his argument before you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14940.854s">And</a> the only person that can change this, the only person that can change this is the issuing authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14946.498s">And</a> who is the issuing authority? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14948.139s">It's</a> the mayor of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14953.93s">because</a> you are on public access right now and you guys and gals are producers because you're making this show, you're producing your comments, you're producing your votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14964.418s">But</a> to get over on that other side of the room and to be there and have your voice heard as an announcement, you'd have to become a producer, you'd have to come and get a quarry check. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14973.045s">And</a> that'll stifle free speech and free access in the city of Medford. <a

href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16863.819s">Just</a> making the comment is one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16866.38s">And</a> the superintendent is absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16869.082s">You</a> guys up here tonight, you shouldn't even be here because you haven't been query checked. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16873.745s">This</a> is public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16875.006s">This</a> is a Medford City Council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16877.408s">It's</a> public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16878.548s">The</a> people can see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16879.789s">They</a> can come in and they can talk the same way you can too. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16884.481s">So</a> you've got to follow the same rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16887.543s">You,</a> in essence, are producing your own show, which is the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16893.166s">Now</a> when you talk about, I think it's section, I believe it's number five, it says here that the producer acknowledges that there's a possibility that the producer will have direct and unsupervised contact with children. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16907.374s">Okay,</a> we'll give you a grant to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16910.468s">But</a> if I never walk into this building and I send you something through the mail to have it played, are you going to play it without having the car rechecked? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16921.919s">Can</a> you answer that? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16922.58s">If</a> you can't answer it, just say yes or no. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16926.004s">I</a> can't answer it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16926.664s">I</a> would have to go back to the city and ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16930.382s">And</a> that's where the problem begins. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16932.343s">You</a> have to go back to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16934.064s">Here's</a> the gentleman who's the manager of the station, and these questions should be all readily available. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16938.966s">You</a> know, there are things on here that talk about what can and cannot be played. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16943.808s">It</a> talks about, in section 4D, materials that contain bias, motivated threats, intimidation, and coercion that interfere with a person's civil rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16956.287s">Well,</a> I can attest to the fact that I was a product of the former, Channel 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16962.851s">They</a> did all of those things to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16966.092s">And</a> now they're putting it in here, and I'm glad to see that it's in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16969.274s">Because</a> there's a civil rights section in here for the violation of any of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16973.196s">And</a> there's also a section here as it relates to what can and cannot be shown, as it relates to obscenities and without getting into the graphics of each and every one of the words. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16983.797s">There</a> I think you might have an issue as it relates to constitutional rights as to when and how it can be spoken and what time of the program, morning, noon, and night, it can be played. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16995.547s">There's</a> also a section here regarding you or anyone who's listening or anyone in this audience who decides to become a producer by giving something. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17009.027s">If</a> you give them something and they lose it, they destroy it or what have you, they're not responsible unless it was gross negligence on their part. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17017.712s">But</a> if you were to borrow something from Channel 3 and there was something wrong and some damage took place, you would be culpably liable financially and otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17029.498s">That's</a> what this agreement says, Mr. Bennett. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17037.623s">I</a> really think what you really need to ask is, there are some people who might want to just come in and say, there's a community section in here on cable television. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17048.429s">They</a> may want to come in, I don't know what the terminology might be, they may want to show a birthday party, or they may want to show a wedding, or whatever it may be, just a one-shot deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17057.595s">And</a> for that one-shot deal, and coming in that entrance over there, not coming in the non-school hours, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17063.255s">You're</a> telling that person, call them a producer, that they have to get a Corby check. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17068.299s">A</a> cousin of mine, you're absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17069.921s">You</a> really need to know the genesis behind this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17071.782s">No</a> city in town around this has this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17074.885s">This</a> is crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17076.386s">This</a> is not making any sense at all, is to go through this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17079.649s">This</a> is going to really stifle free speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17082.071s">This</a> is going to stifle your election coming up right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17085.732s">for</a> reelection and any new candidate running, is you're going to have to get a corporate check to walk into that room, submit a tape, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17094.227s">Now</a> you think about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17096.17s">You've</a> served all these years. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17099.019s">And</a> now you have to submit a quarterly check to get into your local public access channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17103.983s">It</a> makes no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17105.764s">To</a> me, I think it's an administrative discrimination point. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17109.246s">I</a> don't think the administration has the right to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17112.469s">I</a> think the city solicitor needs to come and present his argument before you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17117.392s">And</a> the only person that can change this, the only person that can change this, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17130.554s">you</a> are on public access right now, and you guys and gals are producers because you're making this show, you're producing your comments, you're producing your votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17140.941s">But</a> to get over on that other side of the room and to be there and have your voice heard as an announcement, you'd have to become a producer, you'd have to come and get a Corby check. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17149.587s">And</a> that'll stifle free speech and free access in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17154.671s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17156.172s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2127.493s">Name</a> and address to the record please. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2131.434s">My</a> name is Robert Pentez here of Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2134.075s">I'm</a> a member of the circus party. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2136.076s">There's</a> a couple of things here that would disturb me. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2139.477s">The</a> first one goes on to personnel under the office of community development. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2143.158s">You</a> know, this city is in desperate need of having good qualified people for the purposes of bringing development here into this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2150.86s">Unfortunately,</a> the city does not have a professional grant writer. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2154.185s">It</a> does not have any extra people in that particular office upstairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2158.689s">This</a> is what we heard two years ago when this administration was running. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2161.891s">We</a> were going to boast that particular office with personnel that could bring us to some type of competition. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2167.716s">Our</a> sister city of Somerville, I believe, has either 13 or 14 people in their OCD. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2172.499s">Malden,</a> a smaller city, equal size, has more people than we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2176.282s">But</a> it's a telling story that if you can have two departments that have $100,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2183.016s">as</a> this particular department has, and then you can go to the building department who has a $57,000 personnel line item in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2190.403s">That</a> really tells the story to me that there is absolutely something wrong, and nothing has taken place here over the last two years to bring in good, qualified people if, in fact, the money is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2201.433s">Now,</a> $100,000 just doesn't get there at the end of the year, and neither does $50,000 just get there during the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2207.738s">And</a> if I remember correctly, I believe this council, some six months ago, asked for an interim report as it related to department personnel and expenses, which is obviously you never got. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2218.668s">Contrary</a> to the issue on fire and ice, where the comment was made that you have to raise it on the tax recap, I believe with our approximately $9 million in free cash, <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2228.381s">Years</a> in the past, we have paid deficits off with our free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2233.57s">So</a> I believe you do have an option there, without getting into your recap, and at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2238.65s">I</a> would seriously question another portion of this transfer of why are you transferring $100,000 from the Office of Community Development, which is supposed to be the brainchild of bringing new business into this community, development into this community, meeting with business owners in this community, and being the partner in the arm with the Chamber of Commerce for which it doesn't seem to seem the light of day. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2262.324s">So,</a> Mr. President, I would suggest and I would hope that some member of the City Council would reflect upon that matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2268.729s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2269.509s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3267.67s">Name</a> and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3268.75s">Robert</a> Pentez, Zero Summit Road, Medford Mass, former member of this ward. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3272.471s">I'm</a> glad to see this on the agenda this week because apparently last week when I introduced this before the council as to where this money went, apparently the mayor's office felt necessary to respond to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3282.732s">Let's</a> go back with a little bit of history here. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3284.513s">On</a> October 7th, 2014, <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3287.436s">when</a> the mayor had the press release indicating that the contract had been signed. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3291.898s">And</a> as a result of what took place on September 20th of 2014, with a meeting with the business community and of their concerns at that particular point in time, the mayor made an addendum. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3302.901s">He</a> made an addendum to the contract that was signed. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3305.422s">And</a> he stated, after deliberating and discussing concerns raised by the business community, the mayor is recommending the following changes <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3313.288s">to</a> the signed contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3314.488s">In</a> one of the signed contracts, it was point number three. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3317.249s">It</a> says, I recommend $250,000 on the revenue generated on a yearly basis to be dedicated to the business district improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3329.814s">That</a> was his first comment as it relates to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3332.695s">Then</a> on December 23, 2014, then budget director Burke, <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3338.498s">speaking</a> on behalf of the mayor, issued a press release indicating press highlights of the contract that was signed. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3345.319s">And</a> once again, she states in her press highlights that $250,000 annually will be subject to appropriations to the district improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3354.221s">We</a> know that there are five districts, Mr. President, as you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3358.382s">Then</a> we continue on to December 18th of 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3362.617s">You</a> went from December of 2014, and now you're going to December of 2015, for which the mayor, on his comment to the Medford City Council on December 18th, stated that I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body appropriate the sum of $250,000 for the purposes of <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3382.985s">The</a> five districts regarding to the Park Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3385.787s">This</a> memorandum is a result of what took place during the past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3390.431s">So</a> you have one full year, which is 2015, as Councilmember Mox has alluded to, if we go on an annual basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3397.216s">Then</a> we go to January 28th of 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3401.719s">Now,</a> then Budget Director Burke is the mayor, and this is her comment as it relates to us being the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3408.704s">She</a> states the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3410.748s">After</a> signing a 10-year contract for the program, McGlynn said $250,000 of the city's annual revenue would be used for improvements in the business district. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3419.95s">The</a> prior man made a commitment to that, Burke said. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3422.91s">When</a> we initially rolled it out, my interpretation was that that would be above and beyond the fixed amount that we collected. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3429.971s">I</a> certainly think that the district needs enhancements, Burke continued. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3434.692s">So</a> we'll be working for them to determine what type of monies they need going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3441.035s">You</a> have commitments from the prior Mayor McGlynn to the present Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3445.355s">Now,</a> if you want to take on fiscal years 15 and go from January to December, you're into two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3450.578s">If</a> you want to go into fiscal years June to July, I mean June to July, yeah, June to July, you're into two fiscal years. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3458.083s">So</a> no matter how you cut it, it's $100,000 that should be going back to the districts, not $250,000 or $50,000 each. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3465.387s">I</a> think that is a real big concern because with $100,000 and you're going into the third year right now, you're going to be looking at either next June <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3474.413s">or</a> next December as being into the third year. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3477.035s">So</a> to make a discussion on what the needs might be is one thing, but the real cash that should be going back to these departments, strike that, to these districts within the city, that's where it should be at. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3488.885s">This</a> isn't me making it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3490.306s">This</a> is all part of the official documents that make up this, plus another packet of internal documents that basically reflect upon the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3497.752s">And</a> if you doubt what I'm saying, go back and check your own records and check the meetings that took place <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3502.215s">between</a> the Medford City Council and the business districts that came down there who were upset

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1816.12s">My</a> name is Robert Pintus, Arrow Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1818.742s">I'm</a> a member of the Saugus body. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1820.744s">There's</a> a couple of things here that would disturb me. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1824.087s">The</a> first one goes on to personnel under the Office of Community Development. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1827.75s">You</a> know, this city is in desperate need <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1830.05s">of</a> having good qualified people for the purposes of bringing development here into this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1835.432s">Unfortunately,</a> the city does not have a professional grant writer. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1838.773s">It</a> does not have any extra people in that particular office upstairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1843.295s">This</a> is what we heard two years ago when this administration was running. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1846.476s">We</a> were going to boast that particular office with personnel that could bring us to some type of competition. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1852.298s">Our</a> sister city of Somerville <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1853.928s">I</a> believe it's either 13 or 14 people in their OCD. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1857.09s">Malden,</a> a smaller city, equal size, has more people than we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1860.873s">But</a> it's a telling story that if you can have two departments that have $100,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1867.605s">as</a> this particular department has, and then you can go to the building department, who has a $57,000 personnel line item in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1874.99s">That</a> really tells the story to me that there is absolutely something wrong, and nothing has taken place here over the last two years to bring in good, qualified people, if, in fact, the money is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1886.018s">Now,</a> $100,000 just doesn't get there at the end of the year, and neither does $50,000 just get there during the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1892.342s">And</a> if I remember correctly, I believe this council some six months ago asked for an interim report as it related to department personnel and expenses, which is obviously you never got. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1903.275s">Contrary</a> to the issue on fire and ice, where the comment was made that you have to raise it on the tax recap, I believe with our approximately $9 million in free cash, <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1912.97s">Years</a> in the past, we have paid deficits off with our free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1918.153s">So</a> I believe you do have an option there without getting into your recap. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1921.854s">And</a> at the same time, I would seriously question another portion of this transfer of why are you transferring $100,000 from the Office of Community Development, which is supposed to be the brainchild of bringing new business into this community, development into this community, meeting with business owners in this community, <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1941.244s">and</a> being the partner in the arm with the Chamber of Commerce, for which it doesn't seem to seem the light of day. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1946.889s">So,</a> Mr. President, I would suggest and I would hope that some member of the City Council would reflect upon that matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1953.335s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1954.116s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=2952.28s">Name</a> and address for the record please. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=2953.34s">Robert</a> Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford Mass, former member of this ward. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=2957.062s">I'm</a> glad to see this on the agenda this week because apparently last week when I introduced this before the council as to where this money went, apparently the mayor's office felt necessary to respond to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=2967.28s">Let's</a> go back with a little bit of history here on October 7th, 2014, when the mayor had the press release indicating that the contract had been signed. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=2976.443s">And</a> as a result of what took place in September 20th of 2014, with a meeting with the business community and of their concerns at that particular point in time, the mayor made an addendum. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=2987.446s">He</a> made an addendum to the contract that was signed. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=2989.947s">And</a> he stated, after deliberating and discussing concerns raised by the business community, <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=2995.279s">The</a> mayor is recommending the following changes to the signed contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=2999.042s">In</a> one of the signed contracts, it was point number three, it says, I recommend $250,000 on the revenue generated on a yearly, on a yearly basis to be deducted, dedicated, excuse me, to the business district improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3014.374s">That</a> was his first comment as it relates to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3017.256s">Then</a> on December 23rd, 2014, then budget director Burke, <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3023.074s">speaking</a> on behalf of the mayor, issued a press release indicating press highlights of the contract that was signed. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3029.896s">And</a> once again, she states in her press highlights that $250,000 annually will be subject to appropriations to the district improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3038.779s">We</a> know that there are five districts, Mr. President, as you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3042.941s">Then</a> we continue on to December 18th of 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3047.17s">You</a> went from December of 2014, and now you're going to December of 2015, for which the mayor, on his comment to the Medford City Council on December 18th, stated that I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body appropriate the sum of $250,000 for the purposes of <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3067.541s">the</a> five districts regarding to the Park Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3070.343s">This</a> memorandum is a result of what took place during the past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3075.005s">So</a> you have one full year, which is 2015, as Councilmember Mox has alluded to, if we go on an annual basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3081.829s">Then</a> we go to January 28th of 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3086.331s">Now,</a> then Budget Director Burke is the mayor, and this is her comment as it relates to us being the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3093.315s">She</a> states the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3095.354s">After</a> signing a 10-year contract for the program, McGlynn said $250,000 of the city's annual revenue would be used for improvements in the business district. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3104.557s">The</a> prior mayor made a commitment to that, Burke said. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3107.517s">When</a> we initially rolled it out, my interpretation was that that would be above and beyond the fixed amount that we collected. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3114.579s">I</a> certainly think that the district needs enhancements, Burke continued. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3119.301s">So</a> we'll be working for them to determine what type of monies they need going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3125.658s">You</a> have commitments from the prior Mayor McGlynn to the present Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3129.965s">Now</a> if you wanna take on fiscal years 15 and go from January to December, you're into two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3135.188s">If</a> you wanna go into fiscal years June to July, I mean June to July, yeah, June to July, you're into two fiscal years. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3142.691s">So</a> no matter how you cut it, it's $100,000 that should be going back to the districts, not 250 or 50,000 each. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3149.995s">I</a> think that is a real big concern because with $100,000 and you're going into the third year right now, you're gonna be looking at either next June <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3159.019s">or</a> next December as being into the third year. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3161.64s">So</a> to make the discussion on what the needs might be is one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3166.023s">But</a> the real cash that should be going back to these departments, strike that, to these districts within the city, that's where it should be at. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3173.407s">This</a> isn't me making it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3174.848s">This</a> is all part of the official documents that make up this, plus another packet of internal documents that basically reflect upon the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3182.292s">And</a> if you doubt what I'm saying, go back and check your own records and check the meetings that took place <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3186.754s">between</a> the Medford City Council and the business districts that came down there who were upset because they were not involved in the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3193.637s">That's</a> why Mayor McGlynn at the time changed it in September of 2014 when he signed the contract in October of 2014 to include that on an annual basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3204.743s">Thank</a> you. <a

href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2083.159s">I</a> come here tonight on two very important issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2088.197s">that</a> directly affect this Medford City Council and the taxpayers of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2093.059s">The</a> first one is to address the issue of the CPA, the Community Preservation Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2098.18s">As</a> we know, when it was passed in November of 2015, it has a lifespan of five years from the date of its passage. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2105.062s">It's</a> now going to be just about into its second year with three years to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2109.064s">The</a> unfortunate part about this CPA is that at an election night some two years ago, almost 1,200 to 1,300 ballots <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2117.307s">were</a> never acted upon because a lot of people never turned the ballot over to vote for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2121.409s">So</a> whether it was going to pass or not, nobody even knew. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2124.951s">Apparently,</a> it did pass from those members that did vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2128.172s">The</a> unfortunate part about this particular act, and I'm going to draw the correlation to the connectivity fee, it's another tax being opposed upon the taxpayers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2138.238s">But</a> unfortunately, they're not getting that for which they voted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2143.04s">The</a> Enabling Act, which goes back to 2001 and 2002, <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2147.789s">addressed</a> itself through the years, right up until this past year, to the fact that whatever and however the population count takes place, and however the tax valuation on assessed pieces of property here in the city of Medford, as in all cities and towns, determines the dollar amount that will come back from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2166.419s">Now,</a> we all know that for the past years, the Commonwealth has been having a tough time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2171.862s">So</a> let's just go back to fiscal year 2013, the state gave back <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2177.44s">52</a> percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2178.341s">Fiscal</a> year 2014, 31 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2181.764s">Fiscal</a> year 2015, 29.7 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2186.347s">And</a> this present past fiscal year 2016, they were at 18 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2191.812s">So</a> for every dollar that every taxpayer here in the city of Medford has given up as it relates to their assessed evaluation at the 1.5 percent, the state will give back approximately 18 percent, which is nowhere near the dollar for dollar of 100 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2207.22s">I've</a> spoken to members up at the legislature and I've spoken to other cities and towns where they feel to some degree that the taxpayer is not getting their real bang for the buck. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2216.842s">You</a> guys and gals are into this thing on the second year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2219.742s">You</a> still have no program. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2221.363s">There's</a> still no designation where and how that money can be spent, whether it's for housing, affordable housing, parks and recreation, or historical values. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2232.625s">Those</a> are the three primary things. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2235.269s">at</a> a minimum of each one of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2237.51s">So</a> what I did is I looked at the law and I found it on page, it's section 18. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2243.773s">Larry,</a> he's not here when he comes back. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2247.095s">And</a> I think what I would want to do, and I'll pass one off for each of you, the intent of what I'd like to have is to have you as a city council consider the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2255.139s">Since</a> in fact the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is not paying back dollar for dollar as people <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2260.511s">have</a> been led to believe because of the 158 cities and towns that now make up the CPA throughout the commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2267.658s">I</a> don't think it's fair that we should keep paying, having our taxpayers pay their 1.5 share for the purposes of hopefully thinking they're going to get a match back. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2278.609s">The</a> proposal that I'm asking you as a council to do is to file a piece of legislation to amend <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2285.04s">Section</a> 18, A and B. And in those two sections, they basically will say, if in fact the Commonwealth cannot meet its obligation of dollar for dollar for which the city of Medford at 1.5 is taxing their residents, then the city can suspend, by a vote of the city council, suspend any further collection of those taxes or that 1.5%, or you could also vote to reduce it down to 1%, <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2313.327s">until</a> further notice, until the Commonwealth meets its obligation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2316.909s">That's</a> the first part. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2318.27s">And</a> the second part, and I think it's very important that it's understood, that if this city and this council wants to not renew the CPA after its fifth year, at present, the only way you can do it is it becomes automatically taking place unless the city council, by a vote, puts the question on the ballot and the people vote for it all over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2342.007s">My</a> amendment to that portion states basically this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2345.028s">At</a> the end of the fifth year, it automatically dies. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2348.389s">If,</a> in fact, the people of this community and whoever the council might be at that time wishes to go forward and renew it again for another five years, then the question goes on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2359.073s">You</a> are dealing with right now your second fiscal year on this CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2363.635s">I</a> don't think any one of you behind this rail have even been informed as to where and how that money is going to be spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2368.835s">And</a> there are provisos in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2370.977s">It's</a> a 12-page document. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2372.559s">There</a> are 18 sections that go with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2374.541s">And</a> in those 18 sections, it's very important to understand and to read. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2377.944s">There's</a> a great latitude that up to a nine-member board or a commission has with that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2383.83s">And</a> you as a council haven't even been right into the picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2386.632s">No</a> public meetings and hearings have been held to find out where and how that money can be spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2391.154s">While</a> 30% can go to housing, historical, and open space and recreational, the remaining 70% can be likewise used for the same if not similar situations that CPA will approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2404.079s">I</a> think you folks really need to take a deep hard look at this particular law because as of July 4th, as I said, once people start getting hit with a connectivity fee every other month and then begin to realize that their 1.5%, which is in excess of a million dollars, is being collected here at City Hall, <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2420.382s">And</a> the state is not giving back the dollar for dollar, as people thought they did when they voted for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2425.685s">That's</a> two unfair taxes being placed upon taxpayers at the present time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2431.449s">The</a> second thing I would like to talk about is the money that, on October 7, 2014, after many weeks of failure. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2444.798s">Excuse</a> me. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2446.098s">On</a> October 7, 2014, I don't know what's going on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2453.547s">on</a> October 7th, 2014, after the then Medford City Council was reviewing Park Medford's application before the city of Medford, and Mayor McGlynn, at that point in time, signed the contract on October 7th, 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2472.572s">Five</a> additional addendums were included into that Park Medford contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2479.133s">And</a> the one that stands out is the following, it says, <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2481.942s">He's</a> recommending $250,000 of the revenue generated on a yearly basis to be dedicated to business district improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2490.889s">Now</a> that's a result of the mayor making the comment after deliberating and discussing concerns issued by many business people in the community, the mayor is recommending the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2502.359s">And</a> he did that the same day he made that announcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2507.543s">On</a> December 18th, 2015, <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2510.643s">The</a> Mayor sent out a notice to the members of the City Council, which basically said, in part, a representative of each business district will recommend to the Mayor some proposed uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2525.028s">I</a> respectfully request and recommend that the sum of $250,000 be transferred <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2530.673s">from</a> the sale of real estate to be used for improvements to the five business districts with kiosks as I recommended earlier this year, which would have been effective calendar year 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2543.277s">Now,</a> we go a little bit further. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2544.738s">We</a> go to December 23, 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2549.759s">Once</a> again, in the press release issued by the local press from the mayor's office, it states $250,000 annually would be subject to appropriation <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2558.402s">for</a> district improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2560.083s">And</a> as a result of that, that came from then the mayor's secretary, Lisa Evangelista, and she was given that by then budget director, Stephanie Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2571.071s">And</a> then lastly, we have on January 24th of 2016, once again, after a signing ceremony of a 10-year contract for the program, Mayor McGlynn said $250,000 of the city's annual revenue <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2585.706s">would</a> be used for improvements to business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2589.207s">This</a> is the catch. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2590.667s">The</a> prior mayor made a commitment to that, Burke said. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2594.248s">When</a> we initially rolled it out, my interpretation was that that would be about and beyond the fixed amount that we collected. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2601.97s">Now,</a> how could that be about and beyond when the mayor specifically said it would come out of your real estate account? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2609.092s">Each</a> district right now is $100,000 behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2612.571s">and</a> what they should have been getting for the past two years, inclusive of Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2617.395s">I</a> believe as council members, you have a deep responsibility right now to get answers from this mayor as it relates to not only the $50,000 for each square, where is the money? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2629.065s">Because</a> that money should be designated in the real estate account. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2633.068s">It's</a> unfair to the business districts in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2635.977s">This</a> is an election year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2636.957s">You're</a> going to see a lot of puffing going along. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2638.998s">Well,</a> we're going to do this, and we're going to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2641.199s">Well,</a> I don't think any of these districts have seen anything going on right now that makes them a lot better than they were when they first started when Park Medford came in. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2648.963s">You're</a> talking about $500,000 that should be accounted for right now that should come out of that account sale of real estate for which the mayor indicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2658.578s">You</a> folks have not received one document from this administration telling you that that money would not be forthcoming from that account. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2669.769s">I</a> just think it's unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2671.511s">I</a> think it's unfair to the taxpayers, the business people in this community, the Chamber of Commerce, who are all led to believe that that money would be forthcoming and to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2680.38s">Mr.</a> President, I would like to <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2683.347s">ask</a> that someone on the council, maybe all the council members, ask the mayor, where is the money? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2689.129s">When</a> is it going to be forthcoming to the business districts? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2691.99s">And</a> how can we see it? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2693.851s">So</a> the people of this community will have an understanding that this city keeps its word. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2699.133s">It's</a> just not political puffing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2703.894s">I'd</a> like to pass out the site and sections of the law, which we just talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2710.236s">Could</a> you give one to each one, including the clerk? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2712.252s">I'd</a> like to have you look at it, and in the July meeting, I'd like to come back and see what your thoughts are. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2717.916s">You</a> know, ratepayers in this community are paying an awful lot, not only for their taxes, in their water bills, their sewer bills, now a connectivity fee, you know, and now we're looking at a CPA tax, that all intentions were good, and I think a lot of people would say if we were getting the 100% back from the Commonwealth, we'd be in good shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2738.511s">But</a> if it's only progressed for 18% of this year, <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2742.231s">It's</a> just unfair to keep it in the Medford tax base. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2744.694s">Whether</a> it's $50, $60, $70, $80 a year, that's not the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2748.218s">It's</a> another tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2749.579s">Another</a> tax that cannot be accounted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2751.762s">And</a> this one comes from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2754.385s">So</a> this would probably be easier for you folks to even deal with because it's not even coming from the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2759.37s">I'd</a> be more than happy to answer any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2761.662s">But</a> I just think, you know, when you start looking at these things, it's election year, and walking the streets and talking to people all day long, this is what I hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2769.066s">Why</a> are we paying for these things? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2770.967s">Why</a> are we paying for a connectivity fee when we have $850,000 in a water and sewer surplus account? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2776.87s">Why</a> are we paying for a CPA tax when we're not even getting 100% reimbursement? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2782.353s">And</a> it just doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2784.014s">And</a> then you go into the business districts, they're just completely fed up. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2787.335s">They</a> just can't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2788.82s">what's</a> going on in this building here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2790.501s">There's</a> absolutely no communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2792.081s">There's</a> no transparency as to how and what money is to be spent around here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2797.403s">I'd</a> be more than happy to answer any question if anybody has it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2821.861s">December,</a> the first time it came about after the discussions, like I said, it was October 7th, 2014.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2829.563s">That's</a> when the contract was signed.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2835.305s">I</a> believe it was presented before the council floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2837.585s">A</a> representative from the mayor's office was here on that particular night. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2840.726s">I</a> believe it was in the following January and I believe on January 28th of the following year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2847.572s">the</a> full-blown discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2848.752s">Even</a> maybe Mr. Nash was here the other night. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2850.193s">I</a> could be wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2850.913s">Don't</a> hold me to it, but we've had so many of those meetings.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2860.757s">The</a> administration absolutely said it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2862.597s">That</a> money was going to be earmarked on an annual basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2865.328s">from</a> the sale of real estate to the five business districts.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2871.191s">Oh,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2871.351s">And</a> we got that, as a matter of fact.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2874.994s">You</a> never got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2875.594s">You</a> never got the request to have it appropriated.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2890.43s">But</a> you have, Mr. President, approximately $500,000 that needs to be accounted for for the years 2016 and coming into 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2897.075s">It's</a> a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2898.677s">And</a> where is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2899.357s">And</a> why is it back into the business districts? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2902.099s">That's</a> one of the reasons why Mayor McGlynn back then decided to amend it by adding those five additional things into the contract on an annual basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2909.906s">This</a> was going to be out of the sale of real estate, not something over and beyond that for which Park Medford was paying us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2918.403s">as</a> the former budget director, now present mayor, has indicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2922.626s">Councilor</a> Lungo-Koehn.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2958.559s">Part</a> of that argument, so to speak, back then that was present is it would be on an annual basis that the squares, a representative or representatives from each one of the squares would meet on an annual basis for the purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2970.802s">Now,</a> let's just say if they were into their second year, which would be up to $100,000, <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2975.707s">This</a> could be an ongoing project that maybe needs $50,000, $100,000, $150,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2980.23s">and</a> they could be able to correct whatever it's going to be needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2982.611s">But</a> it's not being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2984.631s">There's</a> been no meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2986.072s">There's</a> been no allowance of the money even to come before the council to be spent and have a presentation said, we're giving this money to Haines Square, this money to West Method, this is what the money is going to be used for, and a representative from each one of the people to come here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2999.196s">You</a> know, this is still taxpayers' money. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3001.216s">No</a> matter how you want to cut it, no matter how it's garnered, the fact of the matter is you have a responsibility as councillors <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3007.297s">to</a> say, well, if this is what the deal was, $250,000 a year, you haven't even have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3012.44s">You</a> don't even have a financial report coming back to you, as you've asked on numerous occasions on an annual or semiannual basis, revenue coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3021.446s">We</a> could just go on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3023.387s">But</a> at least on this particular issue, there's nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3026.349s">There's</a> nothing to talk about, because there's nothing that's been presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3030.132s">And</a> going back to the CPA, the fact that Larry, could you just do this, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3034.595s">Did</a> you pass them out? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3036.015s">Oh,</a> OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3037.541s">The</a> thing in the CPA, we're not taking it away from anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3040.424s">All</a> we're just saying is you're just going to suspend it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3043.166s">Because</a> if you're being told that you're going to get X amount of dollars back for every dollar that you put up, and you're not getting it, why would you want to still keep going back out there and taxing the rate payers? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3054.757s">And</a> if you're taking the million dollars that you have already now for the first year, and you should ask for an accounting, it would be nice to have someone behind the rail ask for an accounting of how much money <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3063.522s">did</a> the city of Medford take in in its first year? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3065.923s">You're</a> going into your second year of a CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3069.143s">What's</a> the intent of spending that money? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3071.184s">Where</a> is the committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3072.604s">What's</a> their findings? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3073.844s">Where's</a> the public meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3075.345s">Where's</a> the public hearing for input? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3078.145s">You're</a> into the second year of it, three years to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3080.526s">It</a> just doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3084.046s">You've</a> got to read the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3084.927s">The</a> law is very specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3087.608s">On</a> the CPA especially. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3089.269s">After</a> it was passed and introduced, you put anywhere up to a five to a nine member board. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3095.031s">It's</a> gotta be done right after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3097.472s">You're</a> supposed to have meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3098.452s">You're</a> supposed to have this presented to the people.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3103.434s">You</a> have a board. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3104.034s">Where's</a> the public meetings on how to spend the money? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3108.076s">They've</a> already had one. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3110.057s">Can</a> you tell me what it was? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3110.897s">I</a> don't know the date. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3112.017s">Was</a> it a public meeting before the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3113.738s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3114.575s">That's</a> what you've got to read and understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3116.598s">Read</a> the 12 pages that make up the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3119.022s">It's</a> very specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3120.544s">And</a> what I'm offering to you is not to abolish it, but just to put it on hold. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3125.311s">If</a> you're not going to get reimbursed from the state, then why take it out of the taxpayers of this community? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3130.718s">And</a> if you can't get it till the end of the fifth year, then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3133.441s">It</a> was a nice try. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3135.183s">And</a> if you look at the makeup on how they go, they go by a population standard, and they also go by a tax rate on the appraised property. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3142.431s">And</a> then it goes into a skew. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3144.653s">It's</a> a very complex situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3147.136s">But</a> if we're generating, Mr. President, over a million dollars a year or thereabouts, and we should be getting that back from the taxpayers of this community, we shouldn't even have to worry about historical things in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3159.082s">We</a> shouldn't have to worry about our parks and open and recreation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3162.083s">We</a> shouldn't have to worry about doing things in the area of public housing in that area or anything else that CPA would allow you to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3170.187s">But</a> we don't even know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3171.348s">None</a> of you know that because you haven't been told what it's going to be used for. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3174.969s">You</a> haven't even had any input. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3177.29s">This</a> is about as transparent as the number six.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3185.553s">Any</a> questions from anybody? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3187.894s">Well,</a> I'll be back in July and hopefully you'll have some kind of an answer to that because if this council feels that they don't want to go forward, <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3197.509s">then</a> I will just go to the state legislature and ask some representative to pass it, because a lot of these cities and towns, they're starting to feel it now, because people are being taxed for something that they're not getting their money back on.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3212.259s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3834.022s">The</a> two sections that I'm referring to on the section 18, basically what the proposal says is as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3841.491s">At</a> any time after imposition of the surcharge, the legislative body may approve by way of a vote to put on hold any local surcharge tax that cannot receive the matching dollar amount from the state upon population rank in real estate property tax levy calculation, as promulgated by Chapter 44B of the Massachusetts state statute. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3863.536s">This</a> allows citizen taxpayers to their fair return of their tax payments until such time <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3869.464s">Until</a> such time, the state has the ability to match the intent and return amount as originally intended, as legislated, and voted upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3879.071s">This</a> is not killing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3880.272s">All</a> it's doing is, how can you tax somebody for something that you're not getting for what you're supposed to be getting? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3886.236s">And</a> the second part of it is basically saying, very simply, at the end of five years, after the date of approval, and after Sections 3 to 7, which is inclusive, have been accepted by the city or town, <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3898.658s">said</a> sections shall come to an end, and the surcharge imposed for the past five years shall end. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3904.519s">If</a> the city or town want to continue on with sections three to seven, that's the inclusive part for which the city of Medford accepted of the Preservation Act, said act shall once again be placed upon the ballot for the taxpayers to vote upon, just the way it was the first time to be voted upon in November of 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3922.684s">That's</a> fair, but to turn around and leave the law the way it is, <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3928.183s">If</a> you want to take it off, you've got to go out there and get the signatures to have the people voted off. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3933.506s">No,</a> I don't think that's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3935.527s">There's</a> a sunset legislation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3937.387s">That's</a> what it should be after five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3939.448s">And</a> if it's really working out that if it's working out that well, then maybe the taxpayers will vote it and maybe the taxpayers won't. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3947.232s">But</a> if you don't give them that chance in that choice, this will just keep going on at it for an item. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3951.794s">And</a> it's a tax that'll never end because it doesn't have the opportunity to end. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3956.857s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3971.484s">Excuse</a> me. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3972.784s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3974.685s">Mr.</a> President, I heard that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3976.745s">Mr.</a> President, it's just as a point of inquiry. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3979.006s">Point</a> of inquiry, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3982.007s">I</a> understand they just received it and placed it on a file. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3984.007s">I</a> asked the council to review it so we could have a discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3987.532s">We</a> could review it for discussion for the July meeting.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=4000.339s">I</a> gave it to you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=4003.101s">One</a> is present, and the other one is proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=4005.922s">That's</a> the section of the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=4008.844s">To</a> the left on the top, it'll say present. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=4011.045s">And</a> the next one down says proposed.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=4023.467s">If</a> you want, I will send you a letter as it relates to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=4026.71s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=4027.95s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=4029.431s">Sorry</a> to interrupt you, Councilor Dello Russo.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5070.108s">Mr.</a> President, Bob Henton, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5073.09s">Two</a> components on this particular issue, and I'm glad it's coming up now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5077.014s">The</a> first one is, I think it's about $112,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5081.377s">That's</a> all that it would cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5083.859s">This</a> is what we were led to believe and what we were told when we changed over from the old metering system to the new one. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5089.048s">to</a> have a computerization program upstairs in the engineer's office that would detect and identify anybody's house in the city of Medford where water would be constantly running or wherever a leak might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5100.395s">And</a> on a daily basis, it would be reviewed, and that homeowner, taxpayer, ratepayer, would be identified either by a phone call or an email or what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5108.62s">That</a> still hasn't taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5110.882s">And</a> I think the next big thing you really need to address <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5113.233s">is</a> that 10 years is already up relative to the meters that are in the houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5116.915s">And</a> that's going to have to take a second look on those batteries that are in there and just how accurate they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5121.837s">So</a> I would suggest that you probably make a resolution to investigate that with the Water and Soil Commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5127.179s">What's</a> their intent going forward as it relates to the accuracy of the batteries that are there, the meters that are there right now that are over 10 years? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5135.323s">And</a> second of all, why can't some money in that multimillion dollar surplus account be used to put that program <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5142.974s">You</a> don't even have to have an employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5144.374s">It's</a> an automatic program that just spits it out on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5147.915s">Someone</a> just looks at it, and it's just, you know, as Jeannie Martin just said, you know, why keep hurting the taxpayer rate payer for no reason at all? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5155.617s">These</a> are just simple, common sense, everyday business practices that should be employed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5161.018s">Thank</a> you, Councilor.<h2><a href="../2017-06-20_l7j4K8jolL8/2017-06-20_l7j4K8jolL8.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 20, 2017 [Livestream] (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1943.464s">My</a> name is Robert Penter, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1947.147s">I'm</a> a member of this August body. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1949.208s">I</a> come here tonight on two very important issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1954.227s">that</a> directly affect this Medford City Council and the taxpayers of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1959.091s">The</a> first one is to address the issue of the CPA, the Community Preservation Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1964.215s">As</a> we know, when it was passed in November of 2015, it has a lifespan of five years from the date of its passage. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1971.12s">It's</a> now going to be just about into its second year with three years to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1975.103s">The</a> unfortunate part about this CPA is that at an election night some two years ago, almost 1,200 to 1,300 ballots <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1983.336s">were</a> never acted upon, because a lot of people never turned the ballot over to vote for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1987.438s">So</a> whether it was going to pass or not, nobody even knew. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1990.979s">Apparently,</a> it did pass from those members that did vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1994.2s">The</a> unfortunate part about this particular act, and I'm going to draw the correlation to the connectivity fee, it's another tax being opposed upon the taxpayers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2004.264s">But</a> unfortunately, they're not getting that for which they voted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2009.086s">The</a> Enabling Act, which goes back to 2001 and 2002, <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2013.835s">addressed</a> itself through the years, right up until this past year, to the fact that whatever and however the population count takes place, and however the tax valuation on assessed pieces of property here in the city of Medford, as in all cities and towns, determines the dollar amount that will come back from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2032.466s">Now,</a> we all know that for the past years, the Commonwealth has been having a tough time. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2037.909s">So</a> let's just go back to fiscal year 2013, the state gave back <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2042.969s">52%.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2043.029s">Fiscal</a> year 2014, 31%. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2044.37s">Fiscal</a> year 2015, 29.7%. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2044.93s">And</a> this present past fiscal year 2016, they're at 18%. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2046.812s">So</a> for every dollar that every taxpayer here in the city of Medford has given up as it relates to the assessed evaluation at the 1.5%, the state will give back approximately 18%, which is nowhere near the dollar for dollar of 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2073.249s">I've</a> spoken to members up at the legislature, and I've spoken to other cities and towns, where they feel to some degree that the taxpayer is not getting their real bank for the buck. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2082.897s">You</a> guys and gals are into this thing on the second year. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2085.799s">You</a> still have no program. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2087.401s">There's</a> still no designation where and how that money can be spent, whether it's for housing, affordable housing, parks and recreation, or historical values. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2098.67s">Those</a> are the three primary things. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2101.298s">at</a> a minimum of each one of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2103.539s">So</a> what I did is I looked at the law and I found it on page, it's section 18. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2109.802s">Larry,</a> he's not here when he comes back. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2113.124s">And</a> I think what I would want to do, and I'll pass one off for each of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2116.165s">The</a> intent of what I'd like to have is to have you as a city council consider the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2121.168s">Since</a> in fact the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is not paying back dollar for dollar as people <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2126.54s">have</a> been led to believe because of the 158 cities and towns that now make up the CPA throughout the commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2133.706s">I</a> don't think it's fair that we should keep paying, having our taxpayers pay their 1.5 share for the purposes of hopefully thinking they're going to get a match back. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2144.656s">The</a> proposal that I'm asking you as a council to do is to file a piece of legislation to amend <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2151.089s">Section</a> 18, A and B. And in those two sections, they basically will say, if in fact the Commonwealth cannot meet its obligation of dollar for dollar for which the city of Medford at 1.5 is taxing their residents, then the city can suspend, by a vote of the city council, suspend any further collection of those taxes or that 1.5%, or you could also vote to reduce it down to 1%, <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2179.379s">until</a> further notice, until the Commonwealth meets its obligation. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2182.942s">That's</a> the first part. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2184.323s">And</a> the second part, and I think it's very important that it's understood, that if this city and this council wants to not renew the CPA after its fifth year, at present, the only way you can do it is it becomes automatically taking place unless the city council, by a vote, puts the question on the ballot and the people vote for it all over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2208.056s">My</a> amendment to that portion states basically this, at the end of the fifth year, it automatically dies. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2214.238s">If</a> in fact, if in fact the people of this community and whoever the council might be at that time wishes to go forward and renew it again for another five years, then the question goes on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2225.121s">You</a> are dealing with right now your second fiscal year on this CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2229.682s">I</a> don't think anyone of you behind this rail have even been informed as to where and how that money is going to be spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2234.881s">And</a> there are provisos in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2236.321s">It's</a> a 12, it's a 12 page document. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2238.602s">There</a> are 18 sections to go with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2240.582s">And</a> in those 18 sections, it's very important to understand and to read. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2243.983s">There's</a> a great latitude that up to a nine member board or a commission has with that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2249.865s">And</a> you as a council haven't even been right into the picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2252.666s">No</a> public meetings and hearings have been held to find out where and how that money can be spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2257.187s">While</a> 30% can go to housing, historical and open space and recreational. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2262.482s">The</a> remaining 70% can be likewise used for the same, if not similar, situations that CPA will approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2270.127s">I</a> think you folks really need to take a deep, hard look at this particular law. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2274.489s">Because</a> as of July 1, as I said, once people start getting hit with a connectivity fee every other month, and then begin to realize that their 1.5%, which is in excess of $1 million, is being collected here at City Hall, and the state is not giving back the dollar for dollar, as people thought they did when they voted for this, <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2291.747s">That's</a> two unfair taxes being placed upon taxpayers at the present time. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2297.492s">The</a> second thing I would like to talk about is the money that on October 7th, 2014, after many weeks of, excuse me, on October 7th in 2014, I don't know what's going on here, on October 7th, <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2321.673s">On</a> 2014, after the then Medford City Council was reviewing Park Medford's application before the city of Medford, and Mayor McGlynn at that point in time signed the contract on October 7th, 2014, five additional addendums, five additional addendums were included into that Park Medford contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2345.18s">And</a> the one that stands out is the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2346.86s">It</a> says he's recommending $250,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2350.92s">of</a> the revenue generated on a yearly basis to be dedicated to business district improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2356.941s">Now</a> that's a result of the mayor making the comment after deliberating and discussing concerns issued by many business people in the community, the mayor is recommending the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2368.403s">And</a> he did that the same day he made that announcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2373.584s">On</a> December 18th, 2015, the mayor sent out a <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2378.995s">Notice</a> to the members of the city council, which basically said in part, a representative of each business district will recommend to the mayor some proposed uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2391.081s">I</a> respectfully request and recommend that the sum of $250,000 be transferred from the sale of real estate to be used for improvements to the five business districts with kiosks as I recommended earlier this year, which would have been effective calendar year 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2409.335s">Now</a> we go a little bit further and we go to December 23rd, 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2415.799s">Once</a> again, in the press release issued by the local press from the mayor's office, it states $250,000 annually would be subject to appropriation for district improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2426.146s">And</a> as a result of that, that came from then the mayor's secretary, Lisa Evangelista, and she was given that by then budget director, Stephanie Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2437.132s">And</a> then lastly, <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2438.441s">we</a> have on January 24th of 2016, once again, after a signing ceremony of a 10-year contract for the program, Mayor McGlynn said $250,000 of the city's annual revenue would be used for improvements to business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2455.267s">This</a> is the catch. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2456.707s">The</a> prior mayor made a commitment to that, Burke said. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2460.308s">When</a> we initially rolled it out, my interpretation was that that would be about and beyond <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2465.627s">the</a> fixed amount that we collected. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2468.029s">Now,</a> how could that be about and beyond when the mayor specifically said it would come out of your real estate account? <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2475.153s">Each</a> district right now is $100,000 behind in what they should have been getting for the past two years, inclusive of Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2483.45s">I</a> believe as council members, you have a deep responsibility right now to get answers from this mayor as it relates to not only the $50,000 for each square, where is the money because that money should be designated in the real estate account. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2499.13s">It's</a> unfair to the business districts in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2502.04s">This</a> is an election year. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2503.021s">You're</a> going to see a lot of puffing going along. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2505.062s">Well,</a> we're going to do this and we're going to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2507.244s">Well,</a> I don't think any of these districts have seen anything going on right now that makes them a lot better than they were when they first started when Park Medford came in. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2515.009s">You're</a> talking about $500,000 that should be accounted for right now that should come out of that account sale of real estate for which the mayor indicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2524.642s">You</a> folks have not received one document from this administration telling you that that money would not be forthcoming and not be forthcoming from that account. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2535.813s">I</a> just think it's unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2537.554s">I</a> think it's unfair to the taxpayers, the business people in this community, the Chamber of Commerce, who are all led to believe that that money would be forthcoming and to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2546.443s">Mr.</a> President, I would like to <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2549.41s">ask</a> that someone on the council, maybe all the council members ask the mayor, where is the money? <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2555.192s">When</a> is it going to be forthcoming to the business districts? <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2558.053s">And</a> how can we see it? <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2559.914s">So</a> the people of this community will have an understanding that this city keeps its word. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2565.176s">It's</a> just not political puffing. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2569.057s">Is</a> that Mr. Um, I'd like to pass out the site and sections of the law for which we just talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2576.279s">Could</a> you give one to each one, including the clerk? <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2578.315s">I'd</a> like to have you look at it, and in the July meeting, I'd like to come back and see what your thoughts are. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2583.976s">You</a> know, ratepayers in this community are paying an awful lot, not only for their taxes and their water bills, their sewer bills, now a connectivity fee, you know, and now we're looking at a CPA tax, that all intentions were good. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2598.498s">And</a> I think a lot of people would say if we were getting the 100 percent back from the Commonwealth, we'd be in good shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2604.559s">But</a> if it's only progressed for 18 percent of this year, <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2608.291s">It's</a> just unfair to keep it in the Medford tax base. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2610.754s">Whether</a> it's $50, $60, $70, $80 a year, that's not the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2614.279s">It's</a> another tax, another tax that cannot be accounted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2617.823s">And</a> this one comes from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2620.466s">So</a> this would probably be easier for you folks to even deal with, because it's not even coming from the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2625.072s">I'd</a> be more than happy to answer any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2627.728s">But</a> I just think, you know, when you start looking at these things, it's election year, and walking the streets and talking to people all day long, this is what I hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2635.13s">Why</a> are we paying for these things? <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2637.031s">Why</a> are we paying for a connectivity fee when we have $850,000 in a water and soil surplus account? <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2642.913s">Why</a> are we paying for a CPA tax when we're not even getting 100% reimbursement? <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2648.415s">And</a> it just doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2650.075s">And</a> when you go into the business districts, they're just completely fed up. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2653.396s">They</a> just can't understand what's going on in this building here. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2656.564s">There's</a> absolutely no communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2658.145s">There's</a> no transparency as to how and what money is to be spent around here. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2663.467s">I'd</a> be more than happy to answer any question if anybody has it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2687.924s">December,</a> the first time it came about, after the discussions, like I said, it was October 7, 2014.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2695.626s">That's</a> when the contract was signed.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2701.368s">I</a> believe it was presented before the council floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2703.649s">A</a> representative from the mayor's office was here on that particular night. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2706.79s">I</a> believe it was the following January. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2709.691s">And</a> I believe on January 28 of the following year, <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2713.635s">the</a> full-blown discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2714.815s">Even</a> maybe Mr. Nash was here the other night. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2716.256s">I</a> could be wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2716.976s">Don't</a> hold me to it, but we've had so many of those meetings.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2726.84s">The</a> administration absolutely said it. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2728.66s">That</a> money was going to be earmarked on an annual basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2731.391s">from</a> the sale of real estate to the five business districts.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2737.194s">Oh,</a> yeah, and we got that, as a matter of fact.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2741.057s">You</a> never got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2741.677s">You</a> never got the request to have it appropriated.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2756.51s">But</a> you have, Mr. President, approximately $500,000 that needs to be accounted for for the years 2016 and coming into 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2763.131s">It's</a> a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2764.732s">And</a> where is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2765.432s">And</a> why is it back into the business districts? <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2768.152s">That's</a> one of the reasons why Mayor McGlynn back then decided to amend it by adding those five additional things into the contract on an annual basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2775.954s">This</a> was going to be out of the sale of real estate, not something over and beyond that for which Park Medford was paying us. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2784.466s">as</a> the former budget director, now present mayor, has indicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2788.709s">Councilor</a> Lungo-Koehn.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2824.169s">Part</a> of that argument, so to speak, back then that was present is it would be on an annual basis that the squares, a representative or representatives from each one of the squares would meet on an annual basis for the purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2836.879s">Now,</a> let's just say if they were into their second year, which would be up to $100,000, <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2841.77s">This</a> could be an ongoing project that maybe needs $50,000, $100,000, $150,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2846.29s">and</a> they could be able to correct whatever it's going to be needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2848.691s">But</a> it's not being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2850.711s">There's</a> been no meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2852.152s">There's</a> been no allowance of the money even to come before the council to be spent and have a presentation said, we're giving this money to Haines Square, this money to West Method, this is what the money is going to be used for, and a representative from each one of the people to come here. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2865.276s">You</a> know, this is still taxpayers' money. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2867.276s">No</a> matter how you want to cut it, no matter how it's garnered, the fact of the matter is you have a responsibility as councillors <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2873.36s">to</a> say, well, if this is what the deal was, $250,000 a year, you haven't even have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2878.521s">You</a> don't even have a financial report coming back to you, as you've asked on numerous occasions on an annual or semi-annual basis, revenue coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2887.504s">We</a> could just go on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2889.444s">But</a> at least on this particular issue, there's nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2892.345s">There's</a> nothing to talk about, because there's nothing that's been presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2896.186s">And</a> going back to the CPA, the fact that Larry, could you just do this, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2900.647s">Did</a> you pass them up? <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2902.088s">Oh,</a> OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2903.624s">The</a> thing in the CPA, we're not taking it away from anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2906.487s">All</a> we're just saying is you're just going to suspend it. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2909.229s">Because</a> if you're being told that you're going to get X amount of dollars back for every dollar that you put up, and you're not getting it, why would you want to still keep going back out there and taxing the rate payers? <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2920.82s">And</a> if you're taking the million dollars that you have already now for the first year, and you should ask for an accounting, it would be nice to have someone behind the rail ask for an accounting of how much money <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2929.605s">did</a> the city of Medford take in in its first year? <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2932.007s">You're</a> going into your second year of a CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2935.229s">What's</a> the intent of spending that money? <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2937.27s">Where</a> is the committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2938.691s">What's</a> their findings? <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2939.932s">Where's</a> the public meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2941.413s">Where's</a> the public hearing for input? <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2944.214s">You're</a> into the second year of it, three years to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2946.616s">It</a> just doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2950.138s">You've</a> got to read the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2950.999s">The</a> law is very specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2953.688s">On</a> the CPA especially, after it was passed and introduced, you put anywhere up to a five to a nine member board. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2961.113s">It's</a> got to be done right after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2963.554s">You're</a> supposed to have meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2964.535s">You're</a> supposed to have this presented to the people.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2969.518s">You</a> have a board. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2970.119s">Where's</a> the public meetings on how to spend the money?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2976.142s">Can</a> you tell me what it was? <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2976.963s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2977.984s">Was</a> it a public meeting before the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2979.825s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2980.655s">That's</a> what you've got to read and understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2982.678s">Read</a> the 12 pages that make up the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2985.102s">It's</a> very specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2986.624s">And</a> what I'm offering to you is here is not to abolish it, but just to put it on hold. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2991.391s">If</a> you're not going to get reimbursed from the state, then why take it out of the taxpayers of this community? <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2996.798s">And</a> if you can't get it till the end of the fifth year, then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2999.961s">It</a> was a nice try. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3001.262s">And</a> if you look at the makeup on how they go, they go by a population standard, and they also go by a tax rate on the appraised property. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3008.509s">And</a> then it goes into a skew. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3010.731s">It's</a> a very complex situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3013.213s">But</a> if we're generating, Mr. President, over a million dollars a year or thereabouts, and we should be getting that back from the taxpayers of this community, we shouldn't even have to worry about historical things in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3025.159s">We</a> shouldn't have to worry about our parks and open and recreation. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3028.16s">We</a> shouldn't have to worry about doing things in the area of public housing in that area or anything else that CPA would allow you to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3036.284s">But</a> we don't even know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3037.425s">None</a> of you know that because you haven't been told what it's going to be used for. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3041.027s">You</a> haven't even had any input. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3043.369s">This</a> is about as transparent as the number six.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3051.634s">Any</a> questions from anybody? <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3053.975s">Well,</a> I'll be back in June and July and hopefully you'll have some kind of an answer to that because if this council feels that they don't want to go forward, <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3063.589s">then</a> I will just go to the state legislature and ask some representative to pass it because a lot of these cities and towns, they're starting to feel it now because people are being taxed for something that they're not getting their money back on.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3078.339s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3700.137s">The</a> two sections that I'm referring to on the section 18, basically what the proposal says is as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3707.608s">At</a> any time after imposition of the surcharge, the legislative body may approve by way of a vote to put on hold any local surcharge tax that cannot receive the matching dollar amount from the state upon population rank in real estate property tax levy calculation, as promulgated by Chapter 44B of the Massachusetts state statute. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3729.666s">This</a> allows citizen taxpayers to their fair return of their tax payments until such time <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3735.578s">Until</a> such time, the state has the ability to match the intent and return amount as originally intended, as legislated, and voted upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3745.185s">This</a> is not killing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3746.386s">All</a> it's doing is, how can you tax somebody for something that you're not getting for what you're supposed to be getting? <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3752.35s">And</a> the second part of it is basically saying, very simply, at the end of five years, after the date of approval, and after Sections 3 to 7, which is inclusive, have been accepted by the city or town, <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3764.775s">said</a> sections shall come to an end, and the surcharge imposed for the past five years shall end. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3770.64s">If</a> the city or town want to continue on with sections three to seven, that's the inclusive part for which the city of Medford accepted, of the Preservation Act, said act shall once again be placed upon the ballot for the taxpayers to vote upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3785.512s">Just</a> the way it was the first time to be voted upon in November of 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3788.815s">That's</a> fair, but to turn around and leave the law the way it is, <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3794.3s">If</a> you want to take it off, you've got to go out there and get the signatures to have the people voted off. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3799.622s">No,</a> I don't think that's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3801.623s">There's</a> a sunset legislation. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3803.504s">That's</a> what it should be after five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3805.565s">And</a> if it's really working out that if it's working out that well, then maybe the taxpayers will vote it and maybe the taxpayers won't. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3813.349s">But</a> if you don't give them that chance in that choice, this will just keep going on at it for item. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3817.911s">And</a> it's a tax that'll never end because it doesn't have the opportunity to end. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3822.973s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3842.6s">Mr.</a> President, just as a point of inquiry. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3845.141s">Point</a> of inquiry, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3848.111s">I</a> understand they just received it and placed it on a file. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3850.192s">I</a> asked the council to review it so we could have a discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3853.634s">We</a> could review it for the discussion for the July meeting.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3865.24s">It</a> is. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3866.461s">I</a> gave it to you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3869.223s">One</a> is present and the other one is proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3872.044s">That's</a> the section of the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3874.959s">To</a> the left on the top, it'll say present. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3877.159s">And</a> the next one down says proposed.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3889.582s">If</a> you want, I will send you a letter as it relates to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3892.823s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3894.043s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3895.543s">Sorry</a> to interrupt you. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3896.284s">Counsel</a> Dello Russo.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5235.912s">My</a> name is Robert M. Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of this August party. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5241.575s">The</a> reason why I'm up here is twofold, as the resolution indicates. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5246.123s">I</a> was a little befuddled when I got a copy of my water bill, and then I got a copy of the letter signed by the Board of Water and Soil Commissioners as it relates to what they call a baseline fee, which is, in essence, is a new tax on the rate payers here within this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5261.268s">In</a> their letter, where they make an assessment of $24,000, is $24,483 is necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5264.129s">I</a> don't know if this is a misprint on the spelling here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5274.929s">Pardon</a> me?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5276.51s">It's</a> $24 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5277.47s">No,</a> that's the amount, I believe, of the total amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5280.291s">I</a> believe, if I understood it correctly from the chairman of the board, he alleged that it was approximately a $300,000 deficit on the sewer account. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5288.314s">Now,</a> this August, Marty, some weeks ago, voted to incorporate your enterprise fund, which includes the water and sewer account, as one. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5297.157s">And</a> by having the water and sewer count as one, that allows you, by right and by law, to make adjustments as it relates to profits and losses on either side. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5307.14s">And</a> at the present time, the new water bills that are going to be going up are going to be having an alleged 3% reduction in your water rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5316.563s">but</a> you're going to be charged what they call now a new connectivity fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5321.125s">And</a> this connectivity fee is addressing the fact that if you have whatever your line is that you have in your house, as it relates to your water and sewer hookup, from your house to the street, for which every taxpayer who owns the property owns the line.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5357.829s">The</a> fact of the matter is that the Water and Sewer Commission signed it and the mayor of this community has allowed it and likewise this Metfit City Council has done nothing to rebut it for which you have a unique opportunity right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5369.713s">The</a> fact also presents itself with the issue that with this new combined water and sewer allowance <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5377.458s">Why</a> would you be reducing your water rate by 3% and now coming in and want to put a brand new tax on each and every other month, bimonthly, six times a year, ad infinitum, on Medford taxpayers, knowing that you have a surplus in excess of $8 million and you have a deficit in the sewer account <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5399.925s">for</a> this 2018 year of $300,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5402.225s">That</a> does not make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5406.266s">And</a> the reason why it makes no sense is you will continuously keep going with a profit that you have, and your water and sewer count, and you have nothing presented before you as at the meeting that we had a month ago and as of tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5417.649s">Any</a> major road construction, any major sidewalk construction, any street construction.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5436.818s">The</a> fact of the matter is, Mr. President, the connectivity tax that's going to be charged to the ratepayers.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5468.841s">The</a> Water and Sewer Commission comes under the auspices of the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5471.163s">They</a> are appointed by the mayor, and their recommendations go to the mayor, and their recommendations, I'm quite sure, could not be holding to the taxpayers of this community at an outrageous rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5480.51s">So</a> a new tax and fee is being implemented on the taxpayers of this community.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5555.841s">I'm</a> glad you apologized on behalf of the council, because most recently, everybody got in their water and sewer bills <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5570.062s">a</a> letter that indicated that they were going to be getting a new processing baseline rate, which I will call a tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5578.03s">It's</a> a new tax implemented on the citizens of this community on their water and sewer bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5583.455s">It's</a> called a connectivity fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5586.02s">And</a> you're going to be paying for that each and every other month, six times a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5591.441s">Every</a> taxpayer that owns their home owns from their house to the middle of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5596.382s">That's</a> their pipe. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5597.823s">That's</a> what they're responsible for, and that's what they pay for. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5601.044s">They</a> make that connection already into the city's water and sewer line. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5604.905s">The</a> city is already charging you for water and sewer coming into your house through your pipe, through the connection. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5611.546s">Now,</a> the argument that's being used by the Water and Sewer Commission is <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5615.327s">We</a> need to put this money aside, which is approximately $1 million a year, according to the type and size of your pipe coming into your house, connected to the street, to offset any future costs that might put the city in a negative position. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5632.054s">My</a> argument before this honorable body, I hope most of you can accept that word, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5638.97s">Honorable,</a> is the fact that the water and sewer account that we have right now is an $8.5 million surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5648.156s">You've</a> merged, within the past two months, the water and sewer accounts of the Enterprise as to be one. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5654.821s">If</a> you are alleging, as the Water and Sewer Commission is alleging, there was a $300,000 deficit in the sewer account, but at the same time you're proposing a 3% reduction in the water rate for next year, the irony to that does not make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5671.566s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5672.287s">Because</a> you have an $8 million surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5674.567s">You</a> have them both now merged together. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5676.608s">And</a> the law allows you to take a surplus from one to offset the negative of another or vice versa. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5683.01s">The</a> other thing that this Water and Soil Commission has failed to do, it's under a 360 CMR 1100. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5690.712s">It's</a> a continuation of contract water supplies. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5694.413s">And</a> this came out in 1994. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5695.233s">And</a> it states the following, you incorporate a uniform rate or an alternative structure which provides incentives for water conservation and or is designed to ensure the affordability of water service to low and or fixed income people. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5713.057s">You</a> don't have that at the present time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5715.7s">That's</a> never been brought up before the Water and Soil Commission to give that particular rate out. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5720.644s">You</a> don't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5722.426s">But</a> if you're even going to get into the idea of the thought process of wanting to get into this, how do you justify the rates that are being proposed by the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5731.855s">The</a> rates being proposed by the city range anywhere from <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5736.98s">A</a> residential house up to three quarters of an inch would be $51.66 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5743.082s">Now</a> you may say it's only $51, but you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5745.822s">$51</a> to some people is a lot of money, especially if you're on a fixed income. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5751.184s">And</a> if you have a one inch line coming into your house, it's $141 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5756.585s">Take</a> that and add it on to the CPA tax, for which you're not even going to get reimbursed by the state on. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5762.19s">That</a> is another $50, $60 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5764.212s">And</a> now you're almost up to over $150, $200 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5767.955s">Your</a> taxes each and every year continuously keep going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5770.997s">It's</a> absolutely unfair for the city to even entertain or engage itself in a connectivity fee tax every other month when you're sitting on that kind of a profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5781.666s">Now,</a> if you want to be realistic and look at this thing and say, okay, maybe we should do like some other cities and towns, the community of Melrose, your sister next door, they have a one-time fee and it's at the discretion of the director of public works. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5796.47s">It's</a> a one-time fee of $50 and if you're building a new house and it's a first-time connection, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5802.652s">If</a> you're rebuilding your house and you have to make a reconnection, that reconnection is either $50 and or at the discretion <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5810.671s">of</a> the Director of Public Works, because if you're the same order, it could be abated. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5814.558s">It</a> just doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5819.165s">It</a> doesn't make any sense because you, as the Medford City Council, are supposed to be looking out for the best financial interests of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5828.009s">And</a> the only way you can seem to do it right now, at least through the majority of you, if you so choose, is you just hold this budget in abeyance until the mayor comes forward and indicates how can you keep going out and making these charges against Medford taxpayers and ratepayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5846.697s">Let's</a> flip over to the second part, to the hotel. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5850.261s">You</a> have a hotel proposal that you haven't even sat down, hasn't even been discussed, and there the mayor of this community in the State of the City address in February says this is going to be up and running by the fall of 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5865.902s">You</a> haven't had a discussion either with the contractor who's only been around since 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5872.086s">You</a> don't even know what the taxes is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5875.149s">And</a> the best part about this hotel, you need city and state land to be taken to accommodate the parking that's necessary for this proposed hotel. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5883.575s">Here's</a> your time to discuss it during the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5886.817s">And</a> if you don't discuss it, why give the vote out? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5890.42s">It</a> doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5892.672s">It's</a> unfortunate under this form of government that this mayor who said she was going to be transparent and would have someone here each and every week to listen and to discuss these issues, there's nobody here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5903.656s">You're</a> lucky if that person's been here twice in the two years that it's been here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5908.078s">And</a> what doesn't make sense is how can you go back and keep telling Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer that this is only a small little dollar amount, especially when you're dealing with a surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5919.023s">You've</a> got $9 million in your free cash or thereabouts. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5922.805s">But</a> nobody around here has discussed your $29 million in an unfunded liability. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5929.169s">How</a> are you going to address that? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5930.83s">And</a> is this new connectivity charge going to be able to be used to offset salaries and wages of employees in that department, pension system funds? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5940.876s">These</a> are the questions you need to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5943.157s">And</a> the low and moderate income, fixed income people don't even have a break on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5948.163s">So</a> while you think you're making the taxpayer feel good because you're lowering his water rate by 3%, you're charging him in excess of the 3% by having a bimonthly, six times a year, new tax being placed upon him. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5965.193s">And</a> the line that should really get you in every single ratepayer is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5969.435s">It</a> says, the base rate is not a tax, nor is it an additional charge in which residents pay for water and sewer services. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5976.979s">Well,</a> you tell me what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5979.02s">You</a> tell me, Mr. President, what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5981.141s">If</a> it's not a tax, okay, if it's not a fee, and if it's not for water and sewer services, well, why am I paying a connectivity fee to let that water go through that pipe that comes into the pipe that I own, that comes into my house, that you charge me water and sewer taxes on? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5997.176s">I</a> respectfully ask this Medford City Council to ask this mayor, you hold up this budget and remove this connectivity fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6005.198s">It's</a> an unfair tax, it's unnecessary, and it does not do good for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6012.059s">I'm</a> more than happy to answer any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6014.139s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6041.369s">How</a> you would rebut it is you would tell the mayor that we're not voting for your budget until you tell the Water and Sewer commissioners to roll back that fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6050.214s">You</a> justify $8.5 million sitting there and justify telling the taxpayers you're going to generate another million dollars plus a year with this connectivity fee, and you don't even have a program set aside. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6063.183s">Look</a> at every street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6064.304s">Look</a> at all the streets that are waiting to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6066.505s">Look</a> at the potholes that can't get done. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6068.445s">Look</a> at Evans Street that's been promised for almost two years they were going to get done when the water main broke. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6073.968s">We</a> could just go on and on and on with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6076.369s">You</a> can't keep charging the taxpayers of this community for something, especially when you're sitting on millions of dollars in a surplus in this particular account.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6110.682s">We're</a> reducing the water rate, Madam Chairperson, we're reducing the water rate by 3%. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6116.467s">So</a> if you have a $24 million cost, whatever it is, I think that's what you said, Mr. President, for the cost of coming in this year, and inclusive of that cost is water and sewer charges, because it's coming in, and we all know that your sewer charge is at 121% of your water, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6130.906s">So</a> if the city already knows that they're going to be operating at a $300,000 loss, why wouldn't you just take the money from your $8.5 million profit rather than go out and tell the people we're going to charge you for a connectivity fee and have the audacity to put in a letter that's got nothing to do with water and sewer services? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6149.28s">What</a> do you think, people are stupid? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6151.72s">I'm</a> not stupid. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6153.201s">You</a> know, I love this city, and I'll do anything to make it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6156.564s">But</a> when I see stuff like this, this really gets to me, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6159.906s">And</a> it should get to every one of you members of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6163.149s">Because</a> it's not right, it's not fair, and you can't even take care of people on fixed incomes, you know, allowing you to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6170.575s">You</a> haven't even discussed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6171.835s">Where's</a> the Water and Soil Commissioner on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6176.973s">Didn't</a> mean T.L., Mr. President, but you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6179.454s">When</a> you sit here all night and you watch what's going on here and you're being played to wait till the end of the night, I get upset, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6187.239s">But</a> every dog has its day, remember that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6189.6s">There's</a> an election coming up, and I hope people remember that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6192.522s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2017-06-14_kGliI9h-Ql4/2017-06-14_kGliI9h-Ql4.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 13, 2017 [Livestream] (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8961.89s">The</a> fact of the matter is that the Water and Sewer Commission signed it, and the mayor of this community has allowed it, and likewise, this Medford City Council has done nothing to rebut it, for which you have a unique opportunity right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8973.763s">The</a> fact also presents itself with the issue that with this new combined water and sewer allowance, <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8981.519s">Why</a> would you be reducing your water rate by 3% and now coming in and want to put a brand new tax on each and every other month, bimonthly, six times a year, ad infinitum, on Medford taxpayers, knowing that you have a surplus in excess of $8 million and you have a deficit in the sewer account <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9003.965s">for</a> this 2018 year of $300,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9006.266s">That</a> does not make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9010.307s">And</a> the reason why it makes no sense is you will continuously keep going with a profit that you have, and your water and sewer count, and you have nothing presented before you as of the meeting that we had a month ago and as of tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9021.69s">Any</a> major road construction, any major sidewalk construction, any street construction.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9040.883s">The</a> fact of the matter is, Mr. President, the connectivity tax that's going to be charged to the ratepayers.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9072.846s">The</a> Water and Sewer Commission comes under the auspices of the Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9075.167s">They</a> are appointed by the Mayor, and their recommendations go to the Mayor, and their recommendations, I'm quite sure, could not be holding to the taxpayers of this community at an outrageous rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9084.509s">So</a> a new tax and fee is being implemented on the taxpayers of this community.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9159.838s">I'm</a> glad you apologized on behalf of the council, because most recently, everybody got in their water and sewer bills <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9174.068s">a</a> letter that indicated that they were going to be getting a new processing baseline rate, which I will call a tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9182.058s">It's</a> a new tax implemented on the citizens of this community on their water and sewer bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9187.445s">It's</a> called a connectivity fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9190.017s">And</a> you're going to be paying for that each and every other month, six times a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9195.439s">Every</a> taxpayer that owns their home owns from their house to the middle of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9200.381s">That's</a> their pipe. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9201.822s">That's</a> what they're responsible for, and that's what they pay for. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9205.043s">They</a> make that connection already into the city's water and sewer line. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9208.925s">The</a> city is already charging you for water and sewer coming into your house through your pipe, through the connection. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9215.548s">Now,</a> the argument that's being used by the Water and Sewer Commission is <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9219.329s">We</a> need to put this money aside, which is approximately $1 million a year, according to the type and size of your pipe coming into your house, connected to the street, to offset any future costs that might put the city in a negative position. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9236.053s">My</a> argument before this honorable body, I hope most of you can accept that word, <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9242.984s">Honorable,</a> is the fact that the water and sewer account that we have right now is an $8.5 million surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9252.155s">You've</a> merged, within the past two months, the water and sewer accounts of the Enterprise as to be one. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9258.823s">If</a> you are alleging, as the Water and Sewer Commission is alleging, there was a $300,000 deficit in the sewer account, but at the same time you're proposing a 3% reduction in the water rate for next year, the irony to that does not make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9275.631s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9276.352s">Because</a> you have an $8 million surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9278.633s">You</a> have them both now merged together. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9280.674s">And</a> the law allows you to take a surplus from one to offset the negative of another or vice versa. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9287.077s">The</a> other thing that this Water and Soil Commission has failed to do, it's under a 360 CMR 1100. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9294.762s">It's</a> a continuation of contract water supplies. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9298.465s">And</a> this came out in 1994. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9299.285s">And</a> it states the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9301.947s">You</a> incorporate a uniform rate or an alternative structure which provides incentives for water conservation and or is designed to ensure the affordability of water service to low and or fixed income people. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9317.117s">You</a> don't have that at the present time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9319.76s">That's</a> never been brought up before the Water and Soil Commission to give that particular rate out. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9324.704s">You</a> don't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9326.485s">But</a> if you're even going to get into the idea of the thought process of wanting to get into this, how do you justify the rates that are being proposed by the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9335.914s">The</a> rates being proposed by the city range anywhere from <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9341.055s">A</a> residential house up to 3 quarters of an inch would be $51.66 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9347.142s">Now,</a> you may say it's only $51. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9349.125s">But</a> you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9351.387s">$51</a> to some people is a lot of money, especially if you want a fixed income. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9355.272s">And</a> if you have a one-inch line coming into your house, it's $141 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9360.658s">Take</a> that and add it on to the CPA tax, for which you're not even going to get reimbursed by the state on. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9366.241s">That</a> is another $50, $60 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9368.281s">And</a> now you're almost up to over $150, $200 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9372.023s">Your</a> taxes each and every year continuously keep going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9375.064s">It's</a> absolutely unfair for the city to even entertain or engage itself in a connectivity fee tax every other month when you're sitting on that kind of a profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9385.749s">Now,</a> if you want to be realistic and look at this thing and say, OK, maybe we should do like some other cities and towns, the community of Melrose, your sister next door, they have a one-time fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9397.352s">And</a> it's at the discretion of the director of public works. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9400.553s">It's</a> a one-time fee of $50. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9403.073s">And</a> if you're building a new house and it's a first-time connection, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9406.734s">If</a> you're rebuilding your house and you have to make a reconnection, that reconnection is either $50 and or at the discretion <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9414.753s">of</a> the Director of Public Works, because if you're the same owner, it could be abated. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9418.623s">It</a> just doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9423.246s">It</a> doesn't make any sense because you, as the Medford City Council, are supposed to be looking out for the best financial interests of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9432.07s">And</a> the only way you can seem to do it right now, at least through the majority of you, if you so choose, is you just hold this budget in abeyance until the mayor comes forward and indicates how can you keep going out and making these charges against Medford taxpayers and ratepayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9450.757s">Let's</a> flip over to the second part, to the hotel. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9454.34s">You</a> have a hotel proposal that you haven't even sat down, hasn't even been discussed, and there the mayor of this community in the State of the City address in February says this is going to be up and running by the fall of 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9469.977s">You</a> haven't had a discussion either with the contractor who's only been around since 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9476.16s">You</a> don't even know what the taxes is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9479.221s">And</a> the best part about this hotel, you need city and state land to be taken to accommodate the parking that's necessary for this proposed hotel. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9487.624s">Here's</a> your time to discuss it during the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9490.886s">And</a> if you don't discuss it, why give the vote out? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9494.487s">It</a> doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9496.741s">It's</a> unfortunate under this form of government that this mayor who said she was going to be transparent and would have someone here each and every week to listen and to discuss these issues, there's nobody here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9507.723s">You're</a> lucky if that person's been here twice in the two years that it's been here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9512.144s">And</a> what doesn't make sense is how can you go back and keep telling Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer that this is only a small little dollar amount, especially when you're dealing with a surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9523.086s">You've</a> got $9 million in your free cash or thereabouts. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9526.892s">But</a> nobody around here has discussed your $29 million in an unfunded liability. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9533.258s">How</a> are you going to address that? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9534.9s">And</a> is this new connectivity charge going to be able to be used to offset salaries and wages of employees in that department, pension system funds? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9544.97s">These</a> are the questions you need to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9547.232s">And</a> the low and moderate income, fixed income people don't even have a break on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9552.242s">So</a> while you think you're making the taxpayer feel good because you're lowering his water rate by 3%, you're charging him in excess of the 3% by having a bimonthly, six times a year, new tax being placed upon him. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9569.271s">And</a> the line that should really get you in every single ratepayer is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9573.513s">It</a> says the base rate is not a tax, nor is it an additional charge in which residents pay for water and sewer services. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9581.059s">Well,</a> you tell me what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9583.101s">You</a> tell me, Mr. President, what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9585.223s">If</a> it's not a tax, okay, if it's not a fee, and if it's not for water and sewer services, well, why am I paying a connectivity fee to let that water go through that pipe that comes into the pipe that I own, that comes into my house, that you charge me water and sewer taxes on? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9601.263s">I</a> respectfully ask this Medford City Council to ask this mayor, you hold up this question and remove this connectivity fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9609.29s">It's</a> an unfair tax, it's unnecessary, and it does not do good for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9616.156s">I'm</a> more than happy to answer any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9618.238s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9645.443s">How</a> you would rebut it is you would tell the mayor that we're not voting for your budget until you tell the Water and Sewer commissioners to roll back that fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9654.29s">You</a> justify $8.5 million sitting there and justify telling the taxpayers you're going to generate another million dollars plus a year with this connectivity fee, and you don't even have a program set aside. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9667.262s">Look</a> at every street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9668.383s">Look</a> at all the streets that are waiting to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9670.585s">Look</a> at the potholes that can't get done. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9672.527s">Look</a> at Evans Street that's been promised for almost two years they were going to get done when the water main broke. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9678.032s">We</a> could just go on and on and on with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9680.434s">You</a> can't keep charging the taxpayers of this community for something, especially when you're sitting on millions of dollars in a surplus in this particular account.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9714.735s">We're</a> reducing the water rate, Madam Chairperson, we're reducing the water rate by 3%. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9720.52s">So</a> if you have a $24 million cost, whatever it is, I think that's what you said, Mr. President, for the cost of coming in this year, and inclusive of that cost is water and sewer charges, because it's coming in, and we all know that your sewer charge is at 121% of your water. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9734.975s">So</a> if the city already knows that they're going to be operating at a $300,000 loss, why wouldn't you just take the money from your $8.5 million profit rather than go out and tell the people we're going to charge you for a connectivity fee and have the audacity to put in a letter that's got nothing to do with water and sewer services? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9753.321s">What</a> do you think, people are stupid? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9755.785s">I'm</a> not stupid. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9757.245s">You</a> know, I love this city, and I'll do anything to make it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9760.627s">But</a> when I see stuff like this, this really gets to me, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9764.248s">And</a> it should get to every one of you members of the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9767.209s">Because</a> it's not right, it's not fair, and you can't even take care of people on fixed incomes, you know, allowing you to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9774.631s">You</a> haven't even discussed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9775.891s">Where's</a> the Water and Soil Commissioner on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9781.035s">Didn't</a> mean TL, Mr. President, but you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9783.516s">When</a> you sit here all night and you watch what's going on here and you're being played to wait till the end of the night, I get upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9790.337s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9791.298s">But</a> every dog has its day. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9792.478s">Remember</a> that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9793.658s">There's</a> an election coming up and I hope people remember that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9796.579s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2017-05-09_UJBcHvzH4YE/2017-05-09_UJBcHvzH4YE.html">Medford, MA City Council - May 9, 2017 [Livestream] (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1020.423s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1388.489s">On</a> the motion by Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1390.75s">Name</a> and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1391.93s">My</a> name is Robert Pantazero, Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1395.131s">Former</a> member of the Saugus party. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1397.112s">My</a> records that I have dating back when I was in the council go back to 2010. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1401.874s">when</a> this proposal was made. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1403.415s">And</a> the very first proposal was made by David Hadsall, who was a city engineer some multiple years ago, 20 years ago, when he got involved in an I&I program that saved the city approximately a million gallons of water per day. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1416.266s">Now,</a> subsequent to that period of time, up until now, you've had loans, grant loans, from the MWRA that either were interest-free or minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1426.421s">and</a> some of them have ranged anywhere from $5 million to $3.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1431.765s">The</a> sad part about all of this, as Councilor Marx has alluded to, is the fact that you have unaccounted for water in this city, which ranges anywhere from 17, 18, 19, 20%. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1440.211s">Nobody</a> really has the final handle on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1443.754s">But</a> there are a lot of services in this community that are using our water for which taxpayers, city taxpayers are paying for, and that's unfair too. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1455.0s">Now</a> you folks just passed, I believe it was last week, the combining of your water and sewer accounts together. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1461.623s">And</a> I would suggest as an addendum to the resolution tonight that a request be made to your city solicitor for the purposes of, since these have now been merged together, can those monies be used for any other enterprises or any other general expenditures within your enterprise fund? <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1482.236s">checking</a> this out with other states, and every state does it different as it relates to enterprise funds, I think it's important to note, because if you have merged these two accounts together financially, and where one has a deficit in one year and one might have an excess in another year, it would be very <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1498.695s">convenient</a> to offset one from the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1501.157s">Again,</a> I don't know, every state does it different. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1504.079s">So</a> I think it would behoove you to check this out with your city solicitor as to how the methods merging of its water and sewer account is used as it relates to any other fund, general fund, enterprise funds, general revenue account funds that the city has, because in some states they're allowed to take the excess profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1523.055s">Also,</a> you folks, just as a reminder, what took place last week, <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1527.498s">You</a> were told at a meeting by Mr. Fox and by the chairman of the Water and Sewer Commission that the water rates are going to be reduced by approximately 3% this year, by approximately 3%. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1538.407s">But</a> at the same time, they're going to be introducing what they call a connectivity fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1542.471s">And</a> the connectivity fee is going to be going toward pipe size coming into your house, anywhere from a half inch up to 10 inches, depending whether you're residential or whether you're a commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1553.722s">And</a> I think it's important to note that I think the chairman of the board said, well, we're not going to call it connectivity. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1559.964s">We're</a> going to call it baseline. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1561.805s">But</a> baseline already has its position. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1564.626s">It</a> has its position within the Mass General Laws under chapter 60. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1569.027s">Where</a> is it here? <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1570.528s">It's</a> under chapter 65, chapter 165, section 2B, where it talks about baseline having an effect <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1581.288s">on</a> a city or town which does not reflect upon connectivity. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1584.93s">It</a> goes against large consumer use or the rate of use in the community, whether it goes up or down. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1591.592s">And</a> I think that's something you as a council need to get, that's got to be corrected. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1595.534s">And</a> hopefully, I wish somebody from the Water and Sewer Department were here, chairman or otherwise, to explain this connectivity fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1602.016s">Because</a> I think as we all know, people are looking at it as another fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1606.198s">How</a> can you be charging another fee on a bimonthly basis when in fact, <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1610.344s">your</a> water rates are going down by 3%. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1612.786s">But</a> since, in fact, I believe it was alleged that there is a deficit on the sewer department side, and now with the merging of the water and sewer accounts together, I think the second question needs to be asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1624.356s">Can</a> the excess from one, which would be the revenue, the profit, or the excess money on that, can you use it to offset the deficit from one to the other? <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1633.484s">Because</a> if you look at the merging of the two, <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1635.7s">It</a> incorporates all your vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1639.041s">It</a> incorporates your employees, equipment, salaries, and everything else that goes along with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1644.444s">So</a> I think there is a benefit to what Councilor Marks is alluding. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1649.106s">But</a> more importantly, I don't think that the Medford taxpayer, knowing that there's over $7.5 million in excess account in this particular area, should be taken for the ride of saying, hey, if you're right, Councilor Marks, and it's up to 21%, but whatever it is, <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1665.276s">There</a> should be a full accounting of the water and the metering of the water, and how it's being distributed here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1672.962s">We</a> all run businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1674.504s">Probably</a> some people use more water than others. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1678.627s">But</a> if you're going to go that route, and you're going to start charging people for the size of their water meter coming in, water pipe coming in, <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1685.911s">You</a> know, that's going to have a profound effect on each and every taxpayer here in the city of Medford, because that's going to be on a bimonthly charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1692.572s">And</a> as the enterprise fund will tell you, and all you have to do is look up other states and other cities and towns and how the merging of enterprise funds, what you can and cannot do with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1703.835s">And</a> it's a whole host of activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1705.735s">For</a> example, in Winchester, they have an enterprise fund, but they also have an enterprise activity account fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1712.116s">And</a> again, trying to get a handle on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1713.777s">It</a> also deals with recreation. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1715.482s">and</a> a whole host of other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1717.143s">Granted,</a> Winchester's a town and not a city, but it's the intent and it's the purpose of the legislation and the merger that is written. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1724.286s">So</a> I would suggest that one of you make this request of the city solicitor, just what, in fact, does this enterprise fund, now that it's merged together, water and sewer, allow the city of Medford to do with those monies? <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1737.213s">Can</a> they transfer them? <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1738.514s">Can</a> they merge them? <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1739.714s">Can</a> they be used to offset? <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1741.615s">It</a> doesn't seem logical or with any sense of common sense <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1745.247s">that</a> you could be having a profit in the water side, and you have a deficit on the sewer side. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1751.449s">But</a> to this day, you haven't been able to offset it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1753.61s">But</a> what you're going to be doing is charging a connectivity fee on your pipeline coming in, which supposedly will offset the sewer charge according to what was told you last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1764.194s">But</a> at the same time, you're going to be reducing your water rate by 3%. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1768.188s">It's</a> a lot for people to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1770.17s">It</a> doesn't make any sense at all, especially when you're sitting on seven and a half million dollars, whether you want to call it surplus, reserve, or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1777.877s">This</a> is a huge issue that's before you right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1780.099s">Other</a> than your tax bill, it's the next biggest thing that the citizen of this community has to deal with. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1785.584s">And</a> just for an example, relative to a connectivity fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1789.867s">And</a> your town of Stoneham, which is right across the border, they just have a one-time connectivity charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1796.611s">New</a> house going up, new resident, new line going in, $50 for a residential unit, up to one to five units. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1804.555s">And</a> anything over that in a commercial, it's $1,000 hookup. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1807.977s">And</a> that's what it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1809.738s">One-inch</a> service is $500. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1810.598s">One</a> to two-inch service is $750. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1814.336s">and</a> a two-inch service or above is $1,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1816.598s">Numbers</a> are a lot lower than what's being proposed here. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1819.0s">It's</a> a one-time fee, and that fee is at the discretion of the Director of Public Works and the City of Stoneham. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1825.185s">Every</a> city and town does it different. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1826.586s">I</a> understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1827.807s">But</a> it's hard to explain to the Mr. and Mrs. Medford resident that when you just gave them <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1833.931s">a</a> new tax increase in their bill, when you're hitting them with a CPA tax, Community Preservation Act tax, for which the Commonwealth will not even meet its obligation to match the dollar for dollar that each rate payer is paying, because that's what the people voted on under that assumption. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1850.039s">And</a> now you may be hitting them with a connectivity fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1852.1s">It's</a> just not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1853.601s">So</a> as Councilman Marks has alluded to, and hopefully the council will go along with it, I really think you need a complete assessment of all the water, all the sewer usage, <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1862.578s">here</a> in the city of Metro to get a better handle as it relates to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1866.561s">And</a> it's just a shame that your water and soil commissioners do not appear before this board to explain this. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1872.186s">This</a> is really an involved process, but you're once again hitting the rate payers with another fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1879.071s">And</a> I would assume that that would be very hard to explain, very hard to explain when you're sitting on $7.5 million profit at the present time. <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1886.617s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2017-05-10_3ikc9Lg8Y0c/2017-05-10_3ikc9Lg8Y0c.html">Medford, MA City Council - May 9, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1606.259s">Name</a> and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1607.46s">My</a> name is Robert Pantazero, Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of the Saugus party. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1612.641s">My</a> records that I have dating back when I was in the council go back to 2010. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1617.385s">when</a> this proposal was made. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1618.926s">And</a> the very first proposal was made by David Hatzell, who was a city engineer some multiple years ago, 20 years ago, when he got involved in an I&I program that saved the city approximately a million gallons of water per day. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1631.794s">Now,</a> subsequent to that period of time, up until now, you've had loans, grant loans, from the MWRA that either were interest-free or minimum <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1641.952s">and</a> some of them have ranged anywhere from $5 million to $3.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1647.274s">The</a> sad part about all of this, as Councilor Marksley alluded to, is the fact that you have unaccounted for water in this city, which ranges anywhere from 17, 18, 19, 20%. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1656.657s">Nobody</a> really has the final handle on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1659.278s">But</a> there are a lot of services in this community that are using our water for which taxpayers, city taxpayers are paying for, and that's unfair too. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1670.53s">Now</a> you folks just passed, I believe it was last week, the combining of your water and sewer accounts together. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1678.453s">And</a> I would suggest as an addendum to the resolution tonight, that a request be made to your city solicitor for the purposes of, since these have now been merged together, can those monies be used for any other enterprises or any other general expenditures within your enterprise fund?

<a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1786.04s">It's</a> under chapter 65, chapter 165, section 2B, where it talks about baseline having an effect <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1796.799s">on</a> a city or town which does not reflect upon connectivity. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1800.441s">It</a> goes against large consumer use or the rate of use in the community, whether it goes up or down. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1807.103s">And</a> I think that's something you as a council need to get, that's got to be corrected. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1811.045s">And</a> hopefully, I wish somebody from the Water and Sewer Department were here, chairman or otherwise, to explain this connectivity fee because I think as we all know, people are looking at it as another fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1821.709s">How</a> can you be charging another fee on a bimonthly basis when in fact, <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1825.855s">your</a> water rates are going down by 3%. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1828.317s">But</a> since, in fact, I believe it was alleged that there is a deficit on the sewer department side, and now with the merging of the water and sewer accounts together, I think the second question needs to be asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1839.867s">Can</a> the excess from one, which would be the revenue, the profit, or the excess money on that, can you use it to offset the deficit from one to the other? <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1848.995s">Because</a> if you look at the merging of the two, <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1851.228s">It</a> incorporates all your vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1854.569s">It</a> incorporates your employees, equipment, salaries, and everything else that goes along with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1859.951s">So</a> I think there is a benefit to what Councilor Marks is alluding. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1864.613s">But</a> more importantly, I don't think that the Medford taxpayer, knowing that there's over $7.5 million in excess account in this particular area, should be taken for the ride of saying, hey, <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1876.48s">You</a> know, if you're right, Councilor Markson, it's up to 21%. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1879.603s">But</a> whatever it is, there should be a full accounting of the water and the metering of the water and how it's being distributed here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1887.891s">You</a> know, we all run businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1890.013s">Probably</a> some people use more water than others. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1894.137s">But</a> if you're going to go that route and you're going to start charging people for the size of their water meter coming in, water pipe coming in, <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1901.422s">You</a> know, that's going to have a profound effect on each and every taxpayer here in the city of Medford, because that's going to be on a bimonthly charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1908.084s">And</a> as the enterprise fund will tell you, and all you have to do is look up other states and other cities and towns and how the merging of enterprise funds, what you can and cannot do with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1919.327s">And</a> it's a whole host of activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1921.267s">For</a> example, in Winchester, they have an enterprise fund, but they also have an enterprise activity account fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1927.629s">And</a> again, trying to get a handle on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1929.29s">It</a> also deals with recreation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1930.993s">and</a> a whole host of other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1932.654s">Granted,</a> Winchester's a town and not a city, but it's the intent and it's the purpose of the legislation and the merger that is written. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1939.796s">So</a> I would suggest that one of you make this request of the city solicitor, just what, in fact, does this enterprise fund, now that it's merged together, water and sewer, allow the city of Medford to do with those monies? <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1952.701s">Can</a> they transfer them? <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1954.021s">Can</a> they merge them? <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1955.222s">Can</a> they be used to offset? <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1957.119s">It</a> doesn't seem logical or with any sense of common sense that you could be having a profit in the water side and you have a deficit on the sewer side. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1966.948s">But</a> to this day, you haven't been able to offset it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1969.13s">But</a> what you're going to be doing is charging a connectivity fee on your pipeline coming in, which supposedly will offset the sewer charge according to what was told you last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1979.7s">But</a> at the same time, you're going to be reducing your water rate by 3%. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1983.702s">It's</a> a lot for people to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1985.684s">It</a> doesn't make any sense at all, especially when you're sitting on seven and a half million dollars, whether you want to call it surplus, reserve, or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1993.369s">This</a> is a huge issue that's before you right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1995.591s">Other</a> than your tax bill, it's the next biggest thing that the citizen of this community has to deal with. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2001.075s">And</a> just for an example, relative to a connectivity fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2005.375s">And</a> your town of Stoneham, which is right across the border, they just have a one-time connectivity charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2012.097s">New</a> house going up, new resident, new line going in, $50 for a residential unit, up to one to five units. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2020.059s">And</a> anything over that in a commercial, it's $1,000 hookup. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2023.459s">And</a> that's what it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2025.24s">One-inch</a> service is $500. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2027.6s">A</a> one- to two-inch service is $750. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2029.841s">And</a> a two-inch service or above is $1,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2032.121s">Numbers</a> are a lot lower than what's being proposed here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2034.507s">It's</a> a one-time fee, and that fee is at the discretion of the Director of Public Works and the City of Stoneham. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2040.691s">Every</a> city and town does it different. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2042.092s">I</a> understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2043.293s">But</a> it's hard to explain to the Mr. and Mrs. Medford resident that when you just gave them a new tax increase in their bill, when you're hitting them with a CPA tax, Community Preservation Act tax, for which the Commonwealth will not even meet its obligation to match the dollar for dollar that each rate payer is paying, <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2062.493s">Because</a> that's what the people voted on under that assumption. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2065.535s">And</a> now you may be hitting them with a connectivity fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2067.596s">It's</a> just not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2069.096s">So</a> as Councilor Marks has alluded to, and hopefully the council will go along with it, I really think you need a complete assessment of all the water, all the sewer usage here in the city of Metro to get a better handle as it relates to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2082.063s">And</a> it's just a shame that your Water and Sewer Commissioners do not appear before this board to explain this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2087.706s">This</a> is really an involved process. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2090.897s">But</a> you're once again hitting the rate payers with another fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2094.198s">And</a> I would assume that that would be very hard to explain, very hard to explain when you're sitting on $7.5 million profit at the present time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2102.099s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2017-05-03_aTcx-mFr9SQ/2017-05-03_aTcx-mFr9SQ.html">Medford, MA City Council - May 2, 2017 [Livestream] (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4540.88s">Robert</a> Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of the circus party. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4544.981s">You</a> know, a city that forgets about its history won't have any history. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4549.281s">And</a> at the rate we're going in the city right now, the way developers have this opportunity to come in here, seize a piece of property, build upon it, and then take off and make a profit on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4559.696s">perfect</a> example is Luminaires on Locust Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4562.779s">Puts</a> the building up, he's there a year, sells it for $61 million, and he's gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4567.783s">But</a> we're talking about something right now is the history of our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4571.606s">And</a> while Councilman Uncle Kern brings up this issue, whether it be 18 to 24 months, for which I would prefer 24, think of it like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4578.772s">Within</a> the past three years, you folks in a concentrated area of South Street, Toro Ave, and Walnut Street have seen historical pieces of property <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4588.344s">And</a> trees, if you're a lover of trees, and trees be demolished by out of towners, outsiders. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4596.307s">People</a> are only here to do one thing and that's to make a profit on the piece of property and beg upon the people to maybe sell their property, make a big profit and leave town so they can take over, make some money and they can leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4609.152s">It's</a> not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4610.413s">We</a> heard one of your Councilors indicate that the last time you people submitted a report in October, <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4616.193s">It</a> went from October to January, and then it got lost somewhere in translation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4620.674s">That,</a> in and of itself, is the telltale sign of what this city administration thinks about preserving its history, preserving the history of neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4629.617s">And</a> speaking about neighborhoods, when you lose zoning in your neighborhoods, whether it's for an historical purpose or what have you, you've lost the character of your neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4639.259s">South</a> Boston, if you've been following this for the last two weeks, is a perfect example where the residents have gotten together on the development of a gentleman who wants to come in there and take over a piece of property that's perfectly zoned for what he wants to do, but the neighbors are opposed to it because it doesn't fit the character of the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4658.866s">The</a> state representative from that area, Michael Flaherty, has proposed a piece of legislation, and I believe he's doing it tomorrow morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4664.993s">He's</a> proposing a piece of legislation that the character of the neighborhood has to be kept in line for that for which is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4670.578s">It</a> cannot be made to look anything different or obnoxious or something that's not satisfying to the public or to the people in that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4679.37s">You</a> know, we're not going to be here in a few years, because however God decides to take us, and when he decides to take us, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4686.716s">But</a> you guys and girl, you have an opportunity here to make the legacy of this community continue to go forward in a positive way. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4694.262s">If</a> the city administration doesn't want to have the same eye on the prize, then you people should have it, and the zoning should be changed, and the 24 months should be changed, because you tell you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4704.53s">If</a> a developer comes in here and finds out that he might have to wait 24 months to get that piece of property zoned or done for whatever he needs to do, he might think one of two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4715.213s">Number</a> one, I'm going to work with the people or I'm getting out of here because I don't want to deal with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4719.374s">And</a> you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4719.995s">That's</a> probably the best thing because he's not the real person that should be here for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4723.956s">And</a> isn't it interesting that all the people that are coming into the city are out-of-towners? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4728.807s">You've</a> got to thank the people who took up the charge on Locust Street to bring it to court, to challenge the developer for which finally found itself before your body and you folks likewise challenged the developer. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4743.026s">The</a> neighborhood that took on the Salem Street, the Breakpro project. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4748.809s">The</a> neighborhood people had to bring it together, not the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4752.791s">I</a> don't know of any more black eyes that this city administration needs to get to find out what its history is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4758.534s">But</a> you certainly are making history by destroying pieces of property that have not only historical value, they have a family and a personal and a community value. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4769.62s">Do</a> the right thing tonight, ladies and gentlemen. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4771.882s">Vote</a> for the 24 months, because within that 24 months, you can bargain or they can bargain with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4777.726s">But</a> at least the people of this community will know that as an elected official, at least you folks, as a city councilor, are doing the right thing on behalf of the taxpayers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4788.633s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9209.231s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9341.312s">Name</a> and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9343.094s">Robert</a> Penter, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass, former member of this board. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9346.557s">The</a> part that's kind of ironic about this is your projected rates this year for your water and sewer are being reduced by approximately 2.77%. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9355.366s">So</a> if the Water and Sewer Commission has given you a 2.77 projected rate decrease for combined water and sewer, <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9363.317s">And</a> as you said, Councilor Marks, if they're sitting on $8.5 million in a surplus, why would they now want to go out and hit you with a connectivity fee on a quarterly basis? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9372.26s">And</a> if you check any cities and towns, most of them that have a connectivity fee, it's a one-time fee, and that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9380.504s">And</a> it's at the discretion of the Director of Public Works or the Town Administrator, if you are a present homeowner, landowner, and you need to be reconnected, <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9389.706s">There</a> is no charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9391.026s">It</a> would be for a brand new person coming in, building a house, first time around, $50, one-time fee, usually anyone.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9408.893s">Thank</a> you for interrupting me, Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9411.194s">I</a> appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9411.954s">Is</a> there anything else you want to do before I finish? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9415.244s">Would</a> you smile on your face? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9416.385s">You</a> know, let me tell you something. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9418.946s">You</a> know, when somebody's speaking up here, I don't need to be interrupted rudely. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9422.829s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9423.97s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9425.111s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9425.631s">And</a> that's the problem when people view something like this on the council floor and they watch it on television, that doesn't bode very well for you folks sitting here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9433.556s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9435.517s">I</a> just think it's a shame.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9442.176s">The</a> point of order is talking about how this council is going to react. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9447.182s">with</a> the rate increase of a connectivity fee that you're going to be putting on the taxpayers if it comes to be presented before you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9453.606s">I</a> don't think you need to wait until May 2nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9455.727s">I</a> think your vote should take place here tonight, that you're not going to approve it, and you're not going to be supportive of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9461.711s">When</a> you have an $8.5 million, Mr. President, you have an $8.5 million surplus, and you have a projected rate decrease in your water and sewer rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9470.096s">Now</a> you go out and explain that to the right pair of this community.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9473.719s">Wait</a> a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9474.219s">Please</a> answer me. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9475.6s">Explain</a> to me or anyone on the... How do you have a rate decrease when you want to charge a new increase? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9482.385s">You</a> have the CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9482.986s">It</a> will be explained on May 2nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9484.087s">You</a> have the CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9485.068s">You</a> have the CPA as a corollary tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9486.909s">On</a> May 2nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9487.97s">I</a> understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9488.65s">You</a> have a corollary tax, the CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9490.652s">The</a> Commonwealth of Massachusetts is not even going to meet it, not even match it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9493.674s">I</a> did not... You should not be charging the taxpayers that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9496.637s">It</a> was voted on by the citizens of the... And the citizens and you guys can make a representative... You can... <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9502.281s">We</a> have order here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9504.062s">You</a> know what the order was when you and Councilor Dello Russo ran around when the people were talking? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9508.165s">We're</a> talking about the water. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9509.285s">You</a> know something, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9512.047s">You</a> know, trying to keep order with some folks who were just intentionally... They have no sense of respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9520.532s">We're</a> talking about the water. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9521.512s">They</a> have no respect for people at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9523.553s">I</a> understand that, Mr. President, but I do have the podium right now and I have an opportunity to say what I want to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9529.917s">Okay,</a> and I'm sticking to the subject matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9531.578s">And</a> the subject matter is the water, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9533.579s">And</a> I'm saying to you as president of this council, your message back to the Water and Soil Commission should be, we are not going to be any supportive of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9540.523s">When</a> Councilmarks gets the minutes of that meeting and they find out how and why they want to keep taxing the people of this community, it's you folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9547.467s">Your</a> election is coming up this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9549.268s">You</a> guys are going to be paying for it.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4613.602s">Robert</a> Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass, former member of the Sarkis party. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4617.706s">You</a> know, a city that forgets about its history won't have any history. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4622.029s">And</a> at the rate we're going in the city right now, the way developers have this opportunity to come in here, seize a piece of property, build upon it, and then take off and make a profit on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4632.407s">Perfect</a> example is Luminaires on Locust Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4635.488s">Puts</a> the building up, he's there a year, sells it for $61 million, and he's gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4640.51s">But</a> we're talking about something right now is the history of our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4644.312s">And</a> while Councilor Lungo-Koehn brings up this issue, whether it be 18 to 24 months, for which I would prefer 24, think of it like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4651.494s">Within</a> the past three years, you folks in a concentrated area of South Street, Toro Ave, and Walnut Street have seen historical pieces of property <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4661.058s">and</a> trees, if you're a lover of trees, and trees be demolished by out-of-towners, outsiders. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4669.023s">People</a> are only here to do one thing, and that's to make a profit on the piece of property and beg upon the people to maybe sell their property, make a big profit, and leave town so they can take over, make some money, and they can leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4681.872s">It's</a> not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4683.132s">We</a> heard one of your Councilors indicate that the last time you people submitted a report in October, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4688.908s">It</a> went from October to January and then it got lost somewhere in translation. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4693.411s">That</a> in and of itself is the telltale sign of what this city administration thinks about. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4698.195s">preserving</a> its history, preserving the history of neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4702.337s">And</a> speaking about neighborhoods, when you lose zoning in your neighborhoods, whether it's for an historical purpose or what have you, you've lost the character of your neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4711.981s">South</a> Boston, if you've been following this for the last two weeks, is a perfect example where the residents have gotten together on the development of a gentleman who wants to come in there and take over a piece of property <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4722.765s">that's</a> perfectly zoned for what he wants to do, but the neighbors are opposed to it because it doesn't fit the character of the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4731.592s">The</a> state representative from that area, Michael Flaherty, has proposed a piece of legislation, and I believe he's doing it tomorrow morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4737.717s">He's</a> proposing a piece of legislation that the character of the neighborhood has to be kept in line for that for which is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4743.301s">It</a> cannot be made to look anything different or obnoxious or something that's not satisfying to the public or to the people in that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4752.102s">You</a> know, we're not going to be here in a few years, because however God decides to take us, and when he decides to take us, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4759.448s">But</a> you guys and girl, you have an opportunity here to make the legacy of this community continue to go forward in a positive way. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4766.993s">If</a> the city administration doesn't want to have the same eye on the prize, then you people should have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4772.758s">And</a> the zoning should be changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4774.279s">And</a> the 24 months should be changed, because you'll tell you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4777.261s">If</a> a developer comes in here and finds out that he might have to wait 24 months to get that piece of property zoned or done for whatever he needs to do, he might think one of two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4787.929s">Number</a> one, I'm going to work with the people, or I'm getting out of here because I don't want to deal with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4792.092s">And</a> you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4792.733s">That's</a> probably the best thing, because he's not the real person that should be here for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4796.676s">And</a> isn't it interesting that all the people that are coming into the city are out-of-towners? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4801.535s">You've</a> got to thank the people who took up the charge on Locust Street to bring it to court, to challenge the developer, for which finally found itself before your body and you folks, likewise, to challenge the developer. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4815.757s">The</a> neighborhood that took on the Salem Street, the Breakpro project. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4821.54s">The</a> neighborhood people had to bring it together. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4823.761s">Not</a> the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4825.502s">I</a> don't know how many more black eyes that this city administration needs to get to find out what its history is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4831.245s">But</a> you certainly are making history by destroying pieces of property that have not only historical value, they have a family and a personal and a community value. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4842.351s">Do</a> the right thing tonight, ladies and gentlemen. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4844.613s">Vote</a> for the 24 months, because within that 24 months, you can bargain or they can bargain with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4850.457s">But</a> at least the people of this community will know that as an elected official, at least you folks, as a city councilor, are doing the right thing in behalf of the taxpayers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4861.344s">Thank</a> you.

Councilor Lungelkorn is going to because apparently, I think folks, as I was speaking to them today, were led to believe it was going to be next Tuesday evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=215.888s">And</a> here we are, we have nobody here from the fire department or the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=222.569s">But</a> if you go back and look at your capital improvement plan that was offered by the mayor, there's quite a few locations and suggestions in here that raised itself well over two and a half million dollars as to where and how this is going to be funded as it relates to the fire station and into the police station part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=241.093s">You</a> know, a lot of people don't even realize what just took place on the 14th of March <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=246.884s">the</a> day of the storm, the unfortunate circumstance down the fire department and the police department, their generator went out. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=253.369s">Their</a> backup generator to be supportive of their police operations, their telecommunications, their communications back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=261.034s">From</a> what I understand and I believe it to be true, one if not maybe two of the doors of the fire department couldn't even be open because they had no electricity. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=270.3s">And</a> their backup generator, which apparently wasn't serviced like it should have been serviced, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=274.458s">was</a> out for a couple of days and they had to wait for a pot, and that's all because of what took place with the storm. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=280.543s">You</a> really have a whole host of issues here. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=283.124s">You</a> talk about a $2 billion seismic study for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=288.048s">None</a> of you have gone through the reading of the over 690 pages of the $110,000 report that was written in January, submitted in January of 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=296.915s">You're</a> going to be having here <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=301.613s">a</a> little later this evening, because I see the superintendent here, and you're going to be having a discussion on something that relates to the high school in multi-millions of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=309.376s">And</a> you really need to ask the same question. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=310.857s">You're</a> going to have a seismic erratic study for that piece of property up there, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=315.018s">You</a> know, I think it's unfair to the Medford taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=318.179s">Just</a> like you folks, I am a taxpayer here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=321.981s">The</a> building was built in 1962. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=325.542s">Same</a> thing with the high school, honor about in that same year of category. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=329.026s">And</a> they're looking for a major, major overhaul, if not reconstruction or additions to whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=336.754s">But</a> the question really needs to be asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=338.796s">It's</a> obvious that maintenance has not taken place in these buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=342.228s">You,</a> Councilor Caraviello, if you remember correctly, I think it was your first term, the beginning of your first term, you indicated that the all new schools at that point in time, which are 11 years old, was a million point one in arrears for fixtures. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=352.994s">And</a> now it's still well in excess of a million, if not a million two, whatever it might be, 15 years later. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=357.737s">And</a> you don't want to get caught into the same trap that you got caught in before to buy and fix new schools, whether you go from 12 to three or whatever the amount was. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=365.662s">You</a> built new schools because the old ones weren't maintained. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=368.743s">And</a> you're going to be looking at the same argument that's going to be presenting itself <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=371.999s">as</a> it relates to the high school later on this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=374.6s">But</a> this is too important of an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=376.881s">You're</a> talking about at the outset $22 million, $2 million for the alleged, I don't know where that dollar amount came from because I don't think any of you can answer how she came up with $2 million, and $20 million to pay for the station. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=389.168s">And</a> as you heard here a couple of weeks ago when you had the director of finance up here, they're talking about 2022 before anything might be eligible for expiration of bonds that would be needed to pay for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=400.842s">So</a> I think in all fairness, as Councilor Lungo-Koehn has alluded to, there's no reason to jump into this thing tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=408.106s">You've</a> waited a long period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=410.687s">You</a> haven't even satisfied the argument of where the training center would go and the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=415.469s">And</a> if we remember correctly, I think it was <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=417.657s">When</a> the first reading took place, because the fire department were here in mass numbers, the mayor decided to include them in any future development as to where they might go. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=427.607s">To</a> this date, the police department or its union have yet to be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=432.692s">And</a> you folks have yet to be involved in any type of involvement with this thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=436.496s">And</a> it just doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=438.417s">It's</a> not good political sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=439.919s">It's</a> absolutely not good financial sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=442.949s">You</a> know, you have over $28 million in the deficit in your pension system. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=446.931s">You</a> have an application, as you're well aware of, Mr. President, before the Massachusetts Library Association for $20 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=453.094s">And</a> if that comes through, the city of Medford pays 40% of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=456.295s">And</a> you're looking at probably approximately over the next two or three years, if in fact the high school goes forward and gets its application approved with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=465.49s">$25</a> million there of taxpayers' money. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=468.194s">You're</a> looking at a fire station and a police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=471.359s">Can</a> you please tell me who's going to pay for this? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=474.564s">This</a> is nothing more than a leading to Proposition 2.5 override. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=478.53s">And</a> if you look at your sister city of Somerville, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=480.913s">With</a> all the development that has taken place over there, they have still raised their taxes on two, a single two and three family homes, which goes to prove and tell you that development for the sake of development is not always in the best interest of this community or any community. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=497.186s">You</a> really need to look at the long-term approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=500.175s">And</a> the long-term approach right now would say, one more week, I don't think, is going to make a big thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=505.537s">And</a> you know, you're people all talking about transparency and being fluid and having this conversation with the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=512.78s">Well,</a> where is there all a branch extended to you to sit down and discuss and talk with you about this? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=518.663s">It's</a> not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=519.863s">It's</a> not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=521.084s">And</a> what you're doing is the bottom line. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=523.785s">And</a> what you're doing, you're just accelerating the use and the argument <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=528.832s">to</a> have more people run for this city council and to run for mayor of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=533.138s">Because</a> people are sick and tired and fed, and fed up of being told about all these expenses and not being a part of it, not being included. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=540.948s">And</a> the council, likewise, not including them in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=544.958s">You're</a> not talking about $100,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=547.059s">You're</a> talking about $22 million right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=550.222s">$2</a> million for the study, $20 million allegedly for the station. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=554.685s">None</a> of you can explain how it's going to be paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=557.246s">None</a> of you can explain how she got to the $2 million seismographic study. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=560.689s">You</a> don't even know if an RFQ went out, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=564.151s">I</a> think the move is wrong tonight if you vote for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=566.993s">That</a> sends the wrong message. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=568.634s">And</a> it's definitely, definitely not taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=571.176s">People</a> are police department friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=573.922s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=574.642s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5642.022s">Name</a> and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5643.502s">Robert</a> Penter, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of this board. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5647.803s">With</a> all due respect to the superintendent, I appreciate the fact that he was here. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5651.864s">Knowing</a> that in January that the application is out there, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5655.078s">And</a> knowing that the school committee met, I believe, a week before February 6th, it really doesn't give much time, whether it be for the school committee or even before the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5663.504s">You</a> know, and this is something I believe, Mr. President, that you should have been advised of in a joint meeting between the school committee and the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5670.66s">While</a> the council may have a lot of priorities and financial obligations to meet, that should be not an excuse or a red herring to say that's the reason why they didn't sit down or bring this out sooner. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5680.387s">It's</a> not right, it's not fair, it doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5683.048s">The</a> job is here to deal with everything that this city involves you with. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5686.651s">Finances,</a> education, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5688.892s">And</a> if you have to meet more than one night a week, wow, what a shame that would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5692.735s">Maybe</a> if you met three or four times a week and you made the mayor become involved in all of this and make you to become involved with this, you'd have a better handle on what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5701.46s">Mr.</a> Superintendent, you state on your document that you are submitting, you state, the school which is structurally unsound or otherwise in a condition seriously jeopardizing the health and safety of school children where no alternatives exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5717.25s">You</a> go on further to state that the renovation that took place in 2013 regarding the science labs for which the Medford City Council discussed on more than one night, I believe it was four times, and as a result of that, part of that was because of recertification with the Commonwealth of Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5733.438s">And</a> further, the fact of the matter is that the building has not since then been renovated to meet ADA compliance standards and fire code standards that are needed to be current. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5744.169s">Now,</a> how can our city allow that building right now not to go forward and have those requirements met? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5752.576s">That</a> should be something that the school committee addresses on an annual basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5756.98s">That's</a> an everyday thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5757.88s">You're</a> talking about the safety of the children in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5761.463s">You</a> indicate at that point in time, you indicate that the fire code would be approximately $1,200,000 to do an upgrade on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5767.288s">You</a> also indicated <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5771.942s">that</a> there is no way to close off the sections of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5775.543s">to</a> prevent citizens to enter restricted areas during non-school hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5779.565s">You</a> can go back to 1991, when I was sitting up there as president of the council, and that was an issue that was presented to us as it relates to out-of-towners coming to Medford High School that were not certified to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5790.411s">And</a> in 2012, it was Councilman Marks who brought up the issue regarding the community schools on people coming in and out of the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5797.875s">And</a> now you're talking about maybe having a program that cuts down the entrances, where and how you can get in? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5804.103s">You</a> can walk up to that high school right now at any point in time, after hours, and walk into that building, and there's nobody there to check you in or to check you out. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5812.448s">It's</a> totally unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5813.228s">It's</a> not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5814.929s">I</a> can appreciate the fact that you might want to do all of these things now, but I beg the question, where has the school committee been on each and every one of these budgets, on each and every one of these years, especially on ADA compliance, especially on fire code compliance? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5831.95s">That's</a> the thing that's necessary each and every day, that a child goes to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5836.253s">That's</a> what you pay your taxes for. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5837.974s">That's</a> what a parent believes their elected officials are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5841.056s">They're</a> making sure and ensuring that their children are protected when they go to school each and every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5848.423s">Mr.</a> Belson further stated, with all due respect, that in next year's budget he's going to put a dollar amount in there for school renovations or school upgradings, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5859.373s">We've</a> been talking about this thing for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5861.555s">The</a> new school building program had a 5% annual charge that the city was supposed to put in each and every one of those new buildings to maintain themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5871.204s">And</a> now, Councilor Caraviello, Mr. President, it's well over a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5874.607s">The</a> buildings are less than, they're going on 14 to 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5877.549s">We're</a> right back to where you were in the beginning as the reason why you had to build new schools, because the maintenance didn't take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5884.335s">Granted,</a> Medford High School is a big school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5886.337s">It's</a> a big school to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5888.739s">But</a> you've got three roofs, three brand new roofs on that building, and now you're looking at a fourth one. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5895.925s">The</a> question then becomes, is the quality of the work not right? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5901.053s">Are</a> we not checking out to make sure that the quality of the work is not right? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5904.735s">Are</a> we just paying to have something done? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5909.297s">Another</a> part that I really think that needs to take place to be discussed is the fact that, you know, this is such an important issue because this isn't a million dollars or two million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5921.342s">This</a> is well in excess of your $10 million, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5925.144s">The</a> school committee should be here sitting with you <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5928.478s">And</a> you, Mr. President, I would hope you would call for a joint meeting between the school committee to consider as you go forward on this particular project. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5936.584s">You</a> people got hit with this cold turkey tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5938.705s">You</a> should have been called ahead of time to have a committee of the whole meeting to discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5942.628s">It's</a> before the bodies, before the public here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5946.871s">And</a> to shut off debate on millions of dollars being discussed is wrong.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5971.779s">And</a> if that be the case, that's a dollar amount attached to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5975.961s">Because</a> the application before the school building assistance program, no matter what they allow, is going to have a dollar amount attached to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5981.724s">That</a> dollar amount has to be paid for by the city as to what portion of it they're going to accept, if not all of it or part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5988.567s">It's</a> a dollar amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5990.108s">You</a> should never shut off anybody, colleague or citizen, at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5993.49s">This</a> is the only place you have an opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5995.071s">Nobody</a> was shut off. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5996.091s">I</a> just said you should not shut off anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5998.573s">There</a> was an attempt to end debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6000.334s">Nobody</a> was shut off. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6001.454s">I</a> said there was an attempt to end debate, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6017.143s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6017.904s">Robert's</a> Rules of Order also allows <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6020.258s">Public</a> participation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6021.758s">Public</a> participation is allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6023.579s">I</a> don't want to hear it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6025.979s">What</a> is that, a threat?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6032.2s">This</a> is a public forum, and I have a right to say what I want. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6035.481s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6036.941s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6044.563s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6045.787s">Mr.</a> President, Mr. Belson also alluded to the fact that, and he's probably right in part, but he says we need to be partners with the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6052.252s">We</a> need to be partners between and amongst ourselves, council, school committee people, to get the best of ideas that need to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6058.116s">I</a> can appreciate the fact that he wants to submit something now and you can't change it because the form is there, but it's been hanging around since January of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6064.721s">That's</a> the sad part, since January of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6067.244s">School</a> committee allegedly only met once, if I understand that correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6070.547s">And</a> if that be the case to discuss it, they probably didn't have the same opportunities, and I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6075.01s">Maybe</a> the superintendent presented what he thought the priorities might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6077.632s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6078.453s">None</a> of us know, because we haven't had that opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6080.975s">That's</a> why not having joint meetings with our other legislative body hurts the process that's before you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6086.899s">It</a> hurts the idea that you can get a better idea as to why and how it's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6091.201s">You</a> get a better idea what the cost is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6093.402s">You</a> can get a better idea what the priorities are going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6095.602s">As</a> the gentleman just came up here, Mr. McAuliffe, as he relates to the fact of how he has to run his business and what he has to plan for. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6103.266s">No</a> matter what the outcome is of this, whether they give you $1 million, $5 million, or $6 million, worthy, worthy of work to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6110.957s">You</a> still have no priority program as it relates to any comprehensive financial program as to where this city is going. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6118.288s">Police,</a> fire, retirement board that needs to be paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6121.951s">The</a> deficit as it relates to the retirement fund, $28 million that the city has. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6126.754s">Again,</a> nobody wants to discuss that and how you're going to go forward with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6129.917s">And</a> more importantly, a fire and police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6131.898s">Does</a> that mean now fire and police are going to be separated? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6134.72s">Or</a> is it not going to be separated? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6136.601s">You</a> haven't even gotten a final answer as it relates to the police department going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6140.423s">If</a> they take down the station over there for the training tower for the fire department, and you're going to go to a regional location, that's going to put the fire department at issue for backup, because they're going to have to send their truck and their men to that regional location. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6154.91s">A</a> public safety issue.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6186.068s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6187.269s">Mr.</a> President, the Medford Public Schools <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6190.216s">as</a> in the commentary from the superintendent, would like to meet with state and local governments as it relates to current code, including fire doors, fire alarms, sprinkler systems, and safety conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6200.833s">All</a> things that right now are in potential violation are, if not in violation, as we presently speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6206.456s">After</a> the new, I believe we all can remember, after the new science labs were built, there was a major problem for almost a year where a fire person had to be up at the high school because the fire system, the fire alarm system didn't work as it related to something happened, whether through the electrical department or what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6222.303s">Then,</a> if I understand this correctly, in Mr. Belson's commentary, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6228.352s">And</a> I agree with you 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6230.033s">You</a> said any decision regarding the specific projects and the financial commitments would be developed over time and after multiple meetings within city government and at the state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6242.017s">Well,</a> at least he's got the ability to understand and recognize that city government officials need to sit down and discuss it, much more than the person who calls herself the mayor of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6253.605s">This</a> is a big issue, whether you want to realize it or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6257.066s">The</a> building is 50 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6258.747s">You're</a> talking about the same fire and police station that's down there right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6261.928s">Maintenance</a> didn't take place in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6264.089s">Now,</a> a lot of these things are maintenance driven, whether they be fire, whether they be the windows, whether they be the boiler or what have you, the asbestos. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6271.092s">It's</a> a big building. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6271.793s">I</a> think it's four and a half miles long, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6275.274s">550,000</a> square feet, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6277.915s">It</a> was built at a time to be a college campus type of a school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6283.069s">But</a> that's not the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6284.69s">You're</a> getting a lot of this all at once. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6287.172s">Maybe,</a> to some degree, maybe, whether it's the cafeteria or whatever the auditorium is that they... Maybe if you just stuck to the real desperate needs that the building has on a slow annual basis, you can look at these other things and put them into the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6303.242s">Let</a> me just remind you, and I'll just leave you with this last thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6306.144s">Just</a> look at the city of Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6307.785s">Look</a> at all the development that's taken place over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6311.187s">All</a> the development. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6312.978s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6314.299s">Many,</a> many more jobs, and their taxes keep on going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6319.481s">You</a> don't have that opportunity here in the city of Medford, because if we're going to follow the mainstream of Somerville and taxing the citizens of this community to pay for bond indebtedness that you can't afford, and as Council Marks and others have alluded to, you're going to get yourself into a Proposition 2.5 override, it'll lose. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6336.748s">Everyone</a> behind this council, I guarantee you, will lose if you'll be supportive of that, if you're serving at that point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6342.334s">You</a> need to plan ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6344.095s">And</a> when you plan ahead, you'll be able to address these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6347.117s">These</a> have been long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6348.478s">This</a> is a shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6349.678s">Prior</a> school committees ought to hang their head in embarrassment for allowing this to go this long. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6354.481s">And</a> so should the city of Medford, because that's been their downfall, letting their buildings run into a demise situation year in and year out. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6362.726s">And</a> now you're going to pay the price for it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9636.387s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9636.727s">Name</a> and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9639.067s">Robert</a> Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of this board. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9643.388s">I</a> understand the resolution is adopted, but the question I would have is that why would you want to charge somebody <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9652.583s">a</a> connection fee, because right now you pay from your house to the middle of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9657.226s">So</a> now you're saying that you connect to the city's lines for water and sewer, for which the city charges you for inflow and outflow of the water going through. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9665.891s">We</a> have over $8.5 million in a surplus account that they can't figure out how and where it should be spent as it relates to infrastructure and water-sewer lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9675.4s">Now,</a> if you want to talk about doing that for a commercial piece of property, that's one thing, because they're digging up the street, and there's a linkage fee that's attached to it as it relates to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9683.983s">But</a> on single-family homes, two-family homes, or whatever it might be, you're already charging the homeowners, already paying for that hookup from the middle of the street to the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9694.127s">So</a> I think what you need is probably a further clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9698.419s">as</a> it relates to where it's going on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9700.04s">And</a> I think this begs the question, where are you going with your $8.5 million in the surplus account? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9705.044s">Where's</a> the infrastructure? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9705.985s">Where's</a> the LNI that's taking place in the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9708.927s">Where</a> are the projects that have been sitting there that need to be addressed? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9712.41s">Before</a> you start charging another fee, possibly, to the taxpayer in this community, I mean, you've got a CPA tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9719.494s">that</a> the state isn't even going to give you a dime back, because they have no money to give it back to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9723.656s">So</a> you're technically putting another tax on the Medford resident taxpayer in this community, and they're getting nothing back for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9730.139s">But</a> you are charging them, and you don't even have a program set aside for what it's going to be used for. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9735.381s">You've</a> got almost $8.5 million in water and sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9737.582s">You've</a> got close to $9 million in your free cash account. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9741.304s">And</a> then you're talking about building all these new buildings that need to be built, that nothing can take place until after 2022, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9748.823s">going</a> into 2023 to free up the bonds. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9751.465s">So</a> what are you going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9752.166s">Start</a> taking from your free cash? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9754.088s">Or</a> are you going to do an override of two and a half with the taxpayers? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9757.29s">Or</a> are you going to start laying off people? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9759.652s">You</a> just spent $14.4 million to build a new Department of Public Works building. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9764.176s">You</a> don't have enough men to do it, to work it on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9770.856s">The</a> problem that I see, and it's just my opinion, that you folks have got no relationship with this mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9777.579s">You</a> absolutely have nothing to do with her on anything in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9782.261s">She</a> just uses you for whatever she wants, when she wants. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9786.862s">Listen,</a> if this is going to be cohesive and a working relationship, you people need to put your foot down. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9791.484s">It</a> only takes four of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9793.145s">Four</a> of you have enough intestinal fortitude to tell the city administration enough is enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9799.802s">Because</a> I'll tell you right now, you folks keep going in this direction, your election this November is going to have a different audience out there and behind this rail, because people are fed up with the fact that they're paying for something, they're not getting it, there's no cooperation, there's no fluidness, there's no transparency, and there's no honesty coming out of this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9819.532s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9820.032s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2017-03-21_3UkqIlWnJXM/2017-03-21_3UkqIlWnJXM.html">Medford, MA City Council - Mar. 21, 2017 [Livestream] (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=64.517s">Name</a> and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=65.758s">My</a> name is Robert Pentez, Zero Summit Road, Metford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=69.08s">I'm</a> a former member of the Saugus party. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=71.882s">I</a> can appreciate what Councilor Lungelkern is going to because apparently <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=75.401s">I</a> think folks, as I was speaking to them today, were led to believe it was going to be next Tuesday evening, and here we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=81.043s">We</a> have nobody here from the fire department or the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=87.145s">But</a> if you go back and look at your capital improvement plan that was offered by the <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=92.863s">The</a> Mayor, there's quite a few locations and suggestions in here that raise itself well over $2.5 million as to where and how this is going to be funded as it relates to the fire station and into the police station part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=105.716s">A</a> lot of people don't even realize what just took place on the 14th of March, the day of the storm. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=113.353s">The</a> unfortunate circumstance, the fire department and the police department, their generator went out. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=117.955s">Their</a> backup generator to be supportive of their police operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=122.277s">Their</a> telecommunications, their communications back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=125.578s">From</a> what I understand and I believe it to be true, <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=128.525s">one</a> if not maybe two of the doors of the fire department couldn't even be open because they had no electricity. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=134.97s">Their</a> backup generator, which apparently wasn't serviced like it should have been serviced, was out for a couple of days and they had to wait for a pot, and that's all because of what took place with the storm. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=145.185s">You</a> really have a whole host of issues here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=147.787s">You</a> talk about a $2 billion seismic study for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=152.691s">None</a> of you have gone through the reading of the over 690 pages of the $110,000 report that was submitted in January of 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=164.211s">You're</a> going to be having here a little later this evening, because I see the superintendent here, and you're going to be having a discussion on something that relates to the high school in multi-millions of dollars, and you really need to ask the same question. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=175.458s">You're</a> going to have a seismic erratic study for that piece of property up there too. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=180.301s">I</a> think it's unfair to the Medford taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=182.763s">Just</a> like you folks, I am a taxpayer here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=186.565s">The</a> building was built in 1962. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=190.123s">Same</a> thing with the high school, honor about in that same year of category, and they're looking for a major, major overhaul, if not reconstruction or additions to whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=201.312s">But</a> the question really needs to be asked, it's obvious that maintenance has not taken place in these buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=206.816s">You,</a> Councilor Caraviello, if you remember correctly, I think it was your first term, the beginning of your first term, you indicated that the all new schools at that point in time, which were 11 years old, was a million point one in arrears for fixtures. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=217.521s">And</a> now it's still well in excess of a million, if not a million two, whatever it might be, 15 years later. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=222.343s">And</a> you don't want to get caught into the same trap that you got caught in before to buy and fix new schools, whether you go from 12 to three or whatever the amount was. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=230.246s">You</a> built new schools because the old ones weren't maintained. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=233.328s">And</a> you're going to be looking at the same argument that's going to be presenting itself <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=236.594s">as</a> it relates to the high school later on this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=239.236s">But</a> this is too important of an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=241.537s">You're</a> talking about at the outset, $22 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=244.78s">$2</a> million for the alleged, I don't know where that dollar amount came from, because I don't think any of you can answer how she came up with $2 million, and $20 million to pay for the station. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=253.806s">And</a> as you heard here a couple of weeks ago when you had the director of finance up here, they're talking about 2022 before anything might be eligible for expiration of bonds that would be needed to pay for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=265.473s">So</a> I think in all fairness, as Councilor Longo-Kearns has alluded to, there's no reason to jump into this thing tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=272.741s">You've</a> waited a long period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=275.324s">You</a> haven't even satisfied the argument of where the training center would go and the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=280.13s">And</a> if we remember correctly, I think it was <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=282.305s">When</a> the first reading took place, because the fire department were here in mass numbers, the mayor decided to include them in any future development as to where they might go. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=292.252s">To</a> this date, the police department or its union have yet to be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=297.316s">And</a> you folks have yet to be involved in any type of involvement with this thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=301.119s">And</a> it just doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=303.04s">It's</a> not good political sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=304.541s">It's</a> absolutely not good financial sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=307.578s">You</a> know, you have over $28 million in the deficit in your pension system. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=311.58s">You</a> have an application, as you're well aware of, Mr. President, before the Massachusetts Library Association for $20 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=317.924s">And</a> if that comes through, the city of Medford pays 40% of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=320.925s">And</a> you're looking at probably approximately over the next two or three years, if in fact the high school goes forward and gets its application approved with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=330.099s">20,</a> $25 million there of taxpayers' money. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=332.801s">You're</a> looking at a fire station and a police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=335.983s">Can</a> you please tell me who's going to pay for this? <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=339.184s">This</a> is nothing more than a leading to Proposition 2.5 override. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=343.127s">And</a> if you look at your sister city of Somerville, <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=345.508s">With</a> all the development that has taken place over there, they have still raised their taxes on two, a single two and three family homes, which goes to prove and tell you that development for the sake of development is not always in the best interest of this community or any community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=361.796s">You</a> really need to look at the long-term approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=364.77s">And</a> the long-term approach right now would say, one more week, I don't think is gonna make a big thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=370.132s">And</a> you know, you're people all talking about transparency and being fluid and having this conversation with the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=377.435s">Well,</a> where is her olive branch extended to you to sit down and discuss and talk with you about this? <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=383.318s">It's</a> not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=384.518s">It's</a> not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=385.739s">And</a> what you're doing is the bottom line. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=388.44s">And</a> what you're doing, you're just accelerating the use and the argument <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=393.478s">to</a> have more people run for this city council and to run for mayor of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=397.8s">Because</a> people are sick and tired and fed, and fed up of being told about all these expenses and not being a part of it, not being included. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=405.583s">And</a> the council, likewise, not including them in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=409.604s">You're</a> not talking about $100,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=411.705s">You're</a> talking about $22,000,000 right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=415.547s">$2,000,000</a> for the study, $20,000,000 allegedly for the station. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=419.329s">None</a> of you can explain how it's gonna be paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=421.89s">None</a> of you can explain how she got to the $2,000,000 seismographic study. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=425.351s">You</a> don't even know if an RFQ went out, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=428.813s">I</a> think the move is wrong tonight if you vote for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=431.654s">That</a> sends the wrong message. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=433.295s">And</a> it's definitely, definitely not taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=435.836s">People</a> are police department friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=438.574s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=439.314s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5506.956s">Name</a> and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5508.437s">Robert</a> Penter, Zero Summit Road, Medford Mass, former member of this board. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5512.741s">With</a> all due respect to the superintendent, I appreciate the fact that he was here knowing that in January that the application is out there and knowing that the school committee met, I believe a week before February 6th, it really doesn't give much time, whether it be for the school committee or even before the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5528.433s">You</a> know, and this is something I believe, Mr. President, that you should have been advised of in a joint meeting between the school committee and the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5535.583s">While</a> the council may have a lot of priorities and financial obligations to meet, that should be not an excuse or a red herring to say that's the reason why they didn't sit down. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5544.015s">I'll</a> bring this out soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5545.316s">It's</a> not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5545.937s">It's</a> not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5546.497s">It</a> doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5547.958s">The</a> job is here to deal with everything that the city involves you with. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5551.561s">Finances,</a> education, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5553.823s">And</a> if you have to meet more than one night a week, wow, what a shame that would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5557.666s">Maybe</a> if you met three or four times a week and you made the mayor become involved in all of this and make you to become involved with this, you'd have a better handle on what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5566.385s">Mr.</a> Superintendent, you state on your document that you are submitting, you state, the school which is structurally unsound or otherwise in a condition seriously jeopardizing the health and safety of school children where no alternatives exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5582.197s">You</a> go on further to state that the renovation that took place in 2013 regarding the science labs for which the Medford City Council discussed on more than one night, I believe it was four times, <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5593.88s">And</a> as a result of that, part of that was because of recertification with the Commonwealth of Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5598.341s">And</a> further, the fact of the matter is that the building has not since then been renovated to meet ADA compliance standards and fire code standards that are needed to be current. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5609.105s">Now,</a> how can our city allow that building right now not to go forward and have those requirements met? <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5617.502s">That</a> should be something that the school committee addresses on an annual basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5621.905s">That's</a> an everyday thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5622.786s">You're</a> talking about the safety of the children in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5626.388s">You</a> indicate at that point in time, you indicate that the fire code would be, it's approximately $1,200,000 to do an upgrade on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5635.475s">You</a> also indicated that there is no way to close off the sections of the building <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5640.489s">to</a> prevent citizens to enter restricted areas during non-school hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5644.51s">You</a> can go back to 1991, when I was sitting up there as president of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5648.592s">And</a> that was an issue that was presented to us as it relates to out-of-towners coming to Medford High School that were not certified to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5655.354s">And</a> in 2012, it was Councilman Marks who brought up the issue regarding the community schools on people coming in and out of the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5662.816s">And</a> now you're talking about maybe having a program that cuts down the entrances, where and how you can get in. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5669.038s">You</a> can walk up to that high school right now at any point in time, after hours, and walk into that building, and there's nobody there to check you in or to check you out. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5677.383s">It's</a> totally unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5678.164s">It's</a> not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5679.865s">I</a> can appreciate the fact that you might want to do all of these things now, but I beg the question, where has the school committee been on each and every one of these budgets, on each and every one of these years, especially on ADA compliance, especially on fire code compliance? <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5696.865s">That's</a> the thing that's necessary each and every day, that a child goes to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5701.172s">That's</a> what you pay your taxes for. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5702.894s">That's</a> what a parent believes their elected officials are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5705.979s">They're</a> making sure and ensuring that their children are protected when they go to school each and every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5713.885s">Mr.</a> Belson further stated, with all due respect, that in next year's budget he's going to put a dollar amount in there for school renovations or school upgradings, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5724.288s">We've</a> been talking about this thing for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5726.489s">The</a> new school building program had a 5% annual charge that the city was supposed to put in each and every one of those new buildings to maintain themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5736.132s">And</a> now, Councilor Caraviello, Mr. President, it's well over a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5739.533s">The</a> buildings are less than, they're going on 14 to 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5742.453s">We're</a> right back to where you were in the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5744.554s">That's</a> the reason why you had to build new schools, because the maintenance didn't take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5749.255s">Granted,</a> Medford High School is a big school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5751.235s">It's</a> a big school to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5753.636s">But</a> you've got three roofs, three brand new roofs on that building, and now you're looking at a fourth one. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5760.177s">The</a> question then becomes, is the quality of the work not right? <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5765.968s">Are</a> we not checking out to make sure that the quality of the work is not right? <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5769.65s">Are</a> we just paying to have something done? <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5774.212s">Another</a> part that I really think that needs to take place to be discussed is the fact that, you know, this is such an important issue because this isn't a million dollars or two million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5786.258s">This</a> is well in excess of your $10 million, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5790.08s">The</a> school committee should be here sitting with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5793.393s">And</a> you, Mr. President, I would hope you would call for a joint meeting between the school committee to consider as you go forward on this particular project. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5801.498s">You</a> people got hit with this cold turkey tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5803.619s">You</a> should have been called ahead of time to have a committee of the whole meeting to discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5807.542s">It's</a> before the bodies, before the public here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5811.784s">And</a> to shut off debate on millions of dollars being discussed is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5817.487s">The</a> debate was not shut off.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5836.695s">And</a> if that be the case, that's a dollar, excuse me, Mr. President, that's a dollar amount attached to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5840.877s">Because</a> the application before the school building assistance program, no matter what they allow, is going to have a dollar amount attached to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5846.64s">That</a> dollar amount has to be paid for by the city as to what portion of it they're going to accept, if not all of it or part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5853.503s">It's</a> a dollar amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5855.044s">You</a> should never shut off anybody, colleague or citizen, at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5858.406s">This</a> is the only place you have an opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5859.987s">Nobody</a> was shut off. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5861.007s">I</a> just said you should not shut off anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5863.489s">There</a> was an attempt to end debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5865.27s">Nobody</a> was shut off. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5866.39s">I</a> said there was an attempt to end debate, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5882.058s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5882.819s">Robert's</a> Rules of Order also allows <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5885.187s">Public</a> participation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5886.687s">Public</a> participation is allowed.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5890.909s">What</a> is that, a threat?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5894.73s">I</a> have a right to say what I want.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5897.751s">This</a> is a public forum, and I have a right to say what I want. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5899.972s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5901.452s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5909.495s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5910.702s">Mr.</a> President, Mr. Belson also alluded to the fact that, and he's probably right in part, but he says we need to be partners with the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5917.185s">We</a> need to be partners between and amongst ourselves, council, school committee people, to get the best of ideas that need to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5923.048s">I</a> can appreciate the fact that he wants to submit something now and you can't change it because the form is there, but it's been hanging around since January of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5929.651s">That's</a> the sad part, since January of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5932.18s">School</a> committee allegedly only met once, if I understand that correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5935.483s">And</a> if that be the case to discuss it, they probably didn't have the same opportunities, and I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5939.946s">Maybe</a> the superintendent presented what he thought the priorities might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5942.568s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5943.389s">None</a> of us know, because we haven't had that opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5945.911s">That's</a> why not having joint meetings with our other legislative body hurts the process that's before you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5951.836s">It</a> hurts the idea that you can get a better idea as to why and how what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5956.079s">And</a> you get a better idea what the cost is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5958.361s">You</a> can get a better idea what the priorities are going to be, as the gentleman just came up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5961.944s">Mr.</a> McAuliffe as he relates to the fact that how he has to run his business and what he has to plan for. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5968.207s">No</a> matter what the outcome is of this, whether they give you $1 million, $5 million, or $6 million, worthy, worthy of work to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5975.891s">You</a> still have no priority program as it relates to any comprehensive financial program as to where this city is going. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5983.234s">Police,</a> fire, retirement board that needs to be paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5986.898s">The</a> deficit as it relates to the retirement fund, $28 million that the city has. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5991.703s">Again,</a> nobody wants to discuss that and how you're going to go forward with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5994.867s">And</a> more importantly, a fire and police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5996.829s">Does</a> that mean now fire and police are going to be separated? <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5999.672s">Or</a> is it not going to be separated? <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6001.533s">You</a> haven't even gotten a final answer as it relates to the police department going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6005.374s">If</a> they take down the station over there for the training tower, for the fire department, and you're going to go to a regional location, that's going to put the fire department at issue for backup because they're going to have to send their truck and their men to that regional location. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6019.84s">A</a> public safety issue.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6051.006s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6052.227s">Mr.</a> President, the Medford Public Schools <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6054.566s">as</a> in the commentary from the superintendent, would like to meet with state and local governments as it relates to current code, including fire doors, fire alarms, sprinkler systems, and safety conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6065.78s">All</a> things that right now are in potential violation are, if not in violation, as we presently speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6071.385s">After</a> the new, I believe we all can remember, after the new science labs were built, there was a major problem for almost a year where a fire person had to be up at the high school because the fire system, the fire alarm system didn't work as it related to something happened, whether through the electrical department or what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6087.24s">Then,</a> if I understand this correctly, <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6090.045s">And</a> Mr. Belson's commentary, and I agree with you a hundred percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6094.986s">You</a> said any decision regarding the specific projects and the financial commitments would be developed over time and after multiple meetings within city government and at the state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6106.95s">Well,</a> at least he's got the ability to understand and recognize that city government officials need to sit down and discuss it much more than the person who calls herself the mayor of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6118.558s">This</a> is a big issue, whether you wanna realize it or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6122.021s">The</a> building is 50 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6123.682s">You're</a> talking about the same fire and police station that's down there right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6126.865s">Maintenance</a> didn't take place in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6129.027s">Now</a> a lot of these things are maintenance driven, whether they be fire, whether they be the windows, whether they be the boiler or what have you, the asbestos. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6136.033s">It's</a> a big building. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6136.733s">I</a> think it's four and a half miles long, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6140.216s">550,000</a> square feet, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6142.858s">It</a> was built at a time to be a college campus type of a school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6148.002s">But</a> that's not the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6149.643s">You're</a> getting a lot of this all at once. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6152.125s">Maybe,</a> to some degree, maybe, whether it's the cafeteria or whatever the auditorium is, maybe if you just stuck to the real desperate needs that the building has on a slow annual basis, you can look at these other things and put them into the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6168.175s">Let</a> me just remind you, and I'll just leave you with this last thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6171.076s">Just</a> look at the city of Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6172.717s">Look</a> at all the development that's taken place over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6176.139s">All</a> the development. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6177.91s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6179.23s">Many,</a> many more jobs and their taxes keep on going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6184.412s">You</a> don't have that opportunity here in the city of Medford, because if we're going to follow the mainstream of some of them and taxing the citizens of this community to pay for bond indebtedness that you can't afford. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6196.356s">And</a> as council Marks and others alluded to, you're going to get yourself into a proposition two and a half override. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6201.277s">It'll</a> lose everyone behind this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6202.878s">I</a> guarantee you will lose if you'll be supportive of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6205.279s">If</a> you're serving at that point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6207.267s">You</a> need to plan ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6209.048s">And</a> when you plan ahead, you'll be able to address these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6212.07s">These</a> have been long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6213.41s">This</a> is a shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6214.631s">Prior</a> school committees ought to hang their head. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6216.732s">An</a> embarrassment for allowing this to go this long. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6219.433s">And</a> so should the city of Medford, because that's been their downfall, letting their buildings run into a demise situation year in and year out. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6227.678s">And</a> now you're going to pay the price for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6229.619s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9501.575s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9501.915s">Name</a> and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9504.237s">Robert</a> Penta, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass, former member of this board. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9508.579s">I</a> understand the resolution is adopted, but the question I would have is that, why would you want to charge somebody a connection fee? <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9518.625s">Because</a> right now, you pay from your house to the middle of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9522.427s">So</a> now you're saying that you connect <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9524.298s">to</a> the city's lines for water and sewer, for which the city charges you for inflow and outflow of the water going through. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9530.362s">We</a> have over $8.5 million in a surplus account that they can't figure out how and where it should be spent as it relates to infrastructure and water sewer lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9540.609s">Now,</a> if you want to talk about doing that for a commercial piece of property, that's one thing, because they're digging up the street and there's a linkage fee that's attached to it as it relates to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9549.194s">But</a> on single-family homes, <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9550.967s">two</a> family homes or whatever it might be, you're already charging the homeowners, already paying for that hookup from the middle of the street to the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9559.309s">So</a> I think what you need is probably a further clarification as it relates to where it's going on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9565.23s">And</a> I think this begs the question, where are you going with your $8.5 million in the surplus account? <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9570.231s">Where's</a> the infrastructure? <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9571.172s">Where's</a> the LNI that's taking place in the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9574.112s">Where</a> are the projects that have been sitting there that need to be addressed? <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9577.592s">Before</a> you start charging another fee, possibly, to the taxpayer in this community, I mean, you've got a CPA tax that the state isn't even going to give you a dime back, because they have no money to give it back to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9588.856s">So</a> you're technically putting another tax on the Medford resident taxpayer in this community, and they're getting nothing back for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9595.318s">But</a> you are charging them, and you don't even have a program set aside for what it's going to be used for. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9600.559s">You've</a> got almost $8.5 million in water and sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9602.74s">You've</a> got close to $9 million in your free cash account. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9606.482s">And</a> then they're talking about building all these new buildings that need to be built, that nothing can take place until after 2022, going into 2023 to free up the bonds. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9615.085s">So</a> what are you going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9617.225s">Start</a> taking from your free cash? <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9619.286s">Or</a> are you going to do an override of $2.5 for the taxpayers? <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9622.487s">Or</a> are you going to start laying off people? <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9624.847s">You</a> just spent $14.4 million to build a new Department of Public Works building. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9629.369s">You</a> don't have enough men to do it, to work it on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9636.055s">The</a> problem that I see, and it's just my opinion, that you folks have got no relationship with this mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9642.78s">You</a> absolutely have nothing to do with her on anything in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9647.463s">She</a> just uses you for whatever she wants, when she wants. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9652.067s">Listen,</a> if this is going to be cohesive in a working relationship, you people need to put your foot down. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9656.69s">It</a> only takes four of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9658.351s">Four</a> of you have enough intestinal fortitude to tell the city administration enough is enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9665.005s">Because</a> I'll tell you right now, you folks keep going in this direction, your election this November is going to have a different audience out there and behind this rail. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9672.73s">Because</a> people are fed up with the fact that they're paying for something, they're not getting it, there's no cooperation, there's no fluidness, there's no transparency, and there's no honesty coming out of this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9684.717s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2017-03-03_eMn9IArfaTE/2017-03-03_eMn9IArfaTE.html">Medford, MA City Council - Feb. 28, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4603.02s">Oh,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4604.482s">Name</a> and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4605.602s">I</a> wouldn't be that rude. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4607.183s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4608.063s">Good</a> evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4608.423s">My</a> name is Robert Pinter. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4609.423s">I</a> live at Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., a former member of the Saugus party. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4613.544s">I</a> have some concerns as it relates to whatever this agreement might be between the city and the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4620.325s">And</a> the one glaring thing that stands out with me is that the mayor is going to appoint a committee of fire personnel to work as it relates to a new fire station or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4631.548s">Why</a> didn't that take place for the police department? <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4634.354s">If</a> she's so concerned about the fire department, it's obvious that then she was less concerned about the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4639.878s">And</a> it's quite obvious by this particular writing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4642.74s">And</a> it's more obvious because of the fact that no one from rank and file of the police union were part and parcel of where we're going with all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4651.106s">Second</a> thing, as it relates to the location or relocation possibly of a new fire station, the chief is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4658.031s">He</a> can answer for himself. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4659.012s">But</a> last night, he indicated that the present location is the best place for the fire <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4664.415s">location</a> here in the city of Medford for its headquarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4667.076s">So</a> we take that into consideration because the talk seems to be supposedly getting a new fire station at a new location at a later time. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4675.658s">And</a> then we go to point number four where the mayor says she's going to submit a loan order no later than the 2019 fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4684.18s">That</a> brings you up to May of June of 2020, no later than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4689.582s">But</a> all you're going to be getting <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4691.142s">is</a> allegedly a proposal for one, a new station. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4695.144s">And</a> number two, you know, maybe what the cost is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4698.626s">There's</a> no proviso in here as it's going to relate to how it's going to be paid for, whether it's going to be the Medford taxpayer, because we know right now there's no grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4707.771s">She's</a> still looking for grants, as she said last night, she's on the hunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4711.113s">And</a> in some places there's no grants to be found. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4714.155s">So</a> you're looking at Mr. And Mrs. Medford taxpayer who seems to be the person that's going to be paying it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4719.559s">So</a> I think you have some financial concerns that really need to be taken into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4724.142s">Nothing</a> that's been discussed right now is an obligation of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4728.004s">It's</a> approximate $28 million pension deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4731.686s">You</a> folks haven't mentioned that yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4733.207s">And</a> there's no upticking on paying that down at a faster rate because the interest rates keep going higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4739.671s">The</a> other night there was a contract, excuse me, there was a meeting as it relates to a multi-million dollar refurbishing of Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4748.268s">It's</a> going to cost factor that's going to have to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4751.069s">Most</a> recently, this council voted on, and excitedly, for the Medford Library and a $20 million bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4756.97s">And</a> if that comes through, there's a 40% payback on the city side. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4761.232s">These</a> are things that really have to be taken into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4764.412s">And</a> you, President Caraviello, in your first term, on the second year of your first term, you introduced a document that talked about $1.3 million of necessary repairs on the six new schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4774.895s">That's</a> up to almost a million point five right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4778.19s">This</a> city has a bad history of taking care of its buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4781.272s">The</a> private administration ignored all these buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4784.435s">This</a> city council is now being faced with altogether, all at once, a whole host of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4791.0s">It's</a> obvious that the priorities have not been set. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4793.982s">But</a> the priorities of this particular mayor, her little baby, being this police department thing, and now with the fire department thrown in, she should be here discussing this and making her plea with you folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4806.112s">This</a> is totally unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4808.38s">You</a> folks have never had an opportunity to discuss this issue, never mind the location, never mind the 35,000 square foot building, never mind a three-story building, never mind the fact that if you put a combined operation there, according to Dunn and Sweeney, it won't even fit today's standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4824.909s">And</a> if you look at the 600 plus pages of the report, it alludes to the fact that even if you were to build a new police station and leave the fire station alone, <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4833.459s">What</a> you're going to have is you're going to have mechanical problems that also will have code problems that will not bone up for the next 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4841.226s">And</a> that's going to be a cost factor to take into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4844.569s">If</a> you're talking about a possible 10 to 18 month period or 10 to 12 month period for a designer to come in and an OPM person hired first, everyone keeps forgetting to say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4855.258s">The</a> OPM needs to be hired first. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4857.861s">Once</a> you put that together, <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4860.229s">Why</a> wait and do an 18-month period? <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4862.55s">Why</a> can't you do both at the same time? <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4864.971s">And</a> if you do both at the same time, maybe you can work out a process that basically says you can build this station in increments. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4873.395s">as</a> it relates to building a new police station, and then working on the fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4877.658s">Because</a> we all know on the fire station side of the building, the building is probably in better shape and in better condition than the police side. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4884.082s">But</a> who's to say it isn't, because nobody's gone through there, and Councilor Longo hit it right in the head, maybe you should go in there and have any equality. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4889.846s">Maybe</a> that building should be reviewed for its aesthetic qualities, and whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4894.849s">You</a> know, running around not having any money from the outside, and only dealing with approximately $9 million in your free cash, <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4903.522s">That</a> doesn't leave an awful lot, because then we can talk about your almost $8 million that you have in your water and sewer account, for which Mr. and Mrs. Medford taxpayer has been paying for, and a surplus just sits there, and there is no ongoing proposed work. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4918.392s">And</a> you're hitting the taxpayers with that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4920.713s">You're</a> also hitting the taxpayer with the CPA, the Community Preservation Act, which in effect is almost $1 million plus you're taking away from the taxpayers, and there is no known program for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4932.437s">So</a> how much can you keep going back to Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer and say to them, we're charging you for this, this is what the cost is going to be, and readily acknowledge by our own treasurer the fact that the matter is there's going to be some deficit mode as you continue to go forward that's going to have to be offset. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4948.983s">Who's</a> going to pay for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4950.504s">Do</a> you really want to tell the taxpayer you need a Proposition 2.5 override? <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4955.225s">Do</a> you really want to sell that? <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4957.226s">And</a> if everything comes before you, Mr. President, before your council, <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4960.885s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4961.626s">Where's</a> the conversation as it relates to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4964.189s">Where's</a> the priority going to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4965.45s">Is</a> it going to be the high school? <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4966.851s">Is</a> it going to be the library? <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4968.113s">Is</a> it going to be the police department? <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4969.374s">Is</a> it going to be the fire station? <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4971.416s">The</a> fire chief made an excellent point, something I never even thought of, and thank you for bringing it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4976.221s">Talking</a> about storage. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4978.236s">If</a> you can't even store what you have on the property that you have right now, where in God's creation are you gonna put that? <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4984.781s">He</a> said possibly auctioning it off, two bays you're gonna possibly be losing. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4988.744s">You</a> talked about regionalization the other night. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4990.886s">The</a> mayor readily said that we could possibly go to regionalization. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4994.608s">And</a> I believe we heard the fire department indicate and say to you that if we did go to regionalization and we did take one of our trucks and a group of our guys to go there and to do whatever it might takes place at one of these fire academies, so to speak, <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5006.237s">There</a> needs to be a backup here in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5009.038s">And</a> where's the backup to the backup in the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5011.098s">God</a> forbid there's a major fire that takes place. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5013.879s">These</a> are things that haven't been discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5015.919s">That's</a> what you folks should be discussing before you rush into this thing and say we want to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5020.66s">There</a> is nobody, not one person in this room that would be against a fire in a police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5024.781s">I</a> don't think there's anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5026.001s">We'd</a> all be crazy if there was one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5028.161s">We</a> all recognize the fact that the need is there, but we also recognize the fact that the city has been extremely diligent and not maintaining its buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5036.323s">But</a> there needs to be a priority that's set. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5039.004s">There</a> has to be a goal set here, and there has to be a timeline met. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5043.045s">And</a> if it's 2022 that was stated last night, now it's up to 2024 before you start to be making these paybacks, what's the cost going to be as it relates to the new station? <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5054.288s">Mr.</a> McCulloch made an excellent point. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5056.288s">And</a> the point is simply this. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5058.048s">If</a> you have to buy another piece of property for $10 million, is the at-present property worth $10 million? <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5063.049s">Are</a> thereabouts? <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5064.089s">And</a> if it isn't, but it comes close to it, and between the sale and the taxes that it generates, it offsets the cost of where you might be going. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5071.791s">These</a> are things. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5072.531s">And</a> I thank you folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5073.311s">I</a> think it was you, Councilor Lungo-Koehn, who asked to maybe go into executive session to find out who are these other people that the city sat down and spoke with as it relates to possibly moving it around. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5084.303s">You</a> seem to forget one thing as it relates to where the public works department is, because we can't put any equipment in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5090.387s">But</a> the new public works building was being discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5092.849s">What</a> was discussed before this council was building something that could be oversized, not only to handle public works, but to handle our other buildings, whether it be our fire trucks, our police cars, and whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5104.716s">And</a> there was a pushback by the then administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5107.538s">Why</a> was there a pushback? <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5108.699s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5109.6s">And</a> there was also a thought process that told us we could just wrap the whole thing around public works, fire, and police. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5116.006s">And</a> all you would be doing is asking and moving people that are presently there without taking their property, moving their property, so nobody would lose any space. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5124.174s">As</a> a matter of fact, they'd probably have better space, they'd have front view space, but you'd still have the availability of a fire department that's right there in the middle of the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5133.483s">Police</a> department, maybe move back a little bit one way or the other, but they can get around with their cars a lot quicker than a fire truck could. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5140.79s">I</a> don't think you should make a mistake by saying, no, we're not going to vote for this, or yes, we're going to vote for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5146.192s">It's</a> the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5147.832s">And</a> once again, the process has been broken down. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5150.633s">It's</a> been broken down because there's been no communication, a lack of leadership from the mayor's office with this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5157.176s">And</a> all you folks are being required to do is to vote for this thing up and down with absolutely not an ounce of input. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5164.091s">And</a> today is another perfect example of what took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5166.952s">If</a> the fire department can meet with the mayor to get this resolution between themselves, then why wasn't the council involved before or after? <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5176.477s">And</a> who's to say that this mayor is going to be here in 18 months? <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5180.859s">That's</a> the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5182.36s">And</a> that's what you need to ask yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5184.281s">So</a> why are you going out on 18 months when in fact, if you're going to be doing this thing for a police department, why don't you do it for a fire department at the same time? <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5192.905s">That</a> way they'll have a better understanding and a better acknowledgement to the fact where the fire and police can be housed together like they were in 1962 and like the report said. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5202.568s">That</a> report of multiple pages from Dunham and Sweeney going back to 2013 is probably the best example that you can have to tell you and to show you why <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5212.03s">a</a> dual building should work. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5213.692s">But</a> if not, and you decide to go separately in a separate way, that generates and should generate positive discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5220.32s">And</a> one last thing for Mr. Falco, Councilor Falco, when you talked about that training tower, while it seems to be something that, you know, it's going to be there, it might cost $500,000, <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5231.232s">But</a> where in the city is it going to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5233.353s">And</a> you don't want that to be regionalized. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5234.853s">Because</a> if you want that regionalized, you're taking firefighters out of service, out of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5239.235s">You're</a> taking a truck out of our service, out of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5241.796s">You're</a> putting backup there, and there's nobody there for the backup. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5245.137s">And</a> that's the problem that we're going to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5246.878s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5247.258s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=6723.065s">Mr.</a> President, you just don't like me, so that's your problem, Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=6726.828s">The</a> people out there have elected you people. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=6729.19s">We're</a> voting on the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=6730.751s">On</a> your motion, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=6733.253s">On</a> the motion, but apparently, as Councilor Longo-Kearns alluded to, it is contradictory to the point number C. Councilor Longo-Kearns is a resolution that will go to the mayor's office.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=6750.04s">It's</a> the mayor's, it's not the mayor's privilege, it's the council's privilege. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=6753.821s">It's</a> your prerogative, not the mayor's.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=6758.663s">On</a> the loan order in and of itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=6760.343s">It's</a> your prerogative, not prerogative, not the mayor's prerogative. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=6764.084s">And</a> you've already voted on point number C, which is contradictory to the main motion.<h2><a href="../2017-02-28_2hZdDePQb_Y/2017-02-28_2hZdDePQb_Y.html">Medford, MA City Council - Feb. 28, 2017 [Livestream] (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5020.953s">No,</a> we agreed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5021.554s">Oh,</a> OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5022.996s">Name</a> and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5024.136s">I</a> wouldn't be that rude. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5025.697s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5026.597s">Good</a> evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5026.937s">My</a> name is Robert Pinter. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5027.937s">I</a> live at Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., a former member of the Saugus party. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5032.078s">I</a> have some concerns as it relates to whatever this agreement might be between the city and the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5038.839s">And</a> the one glaring thing that stands out with me is that the mayor is going to appoint a committee of fire personnel to work as it relates to a new fire station or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5050.082s">Why</a> didn't that take place for the police department? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5052.888s">If</a> she's so concerned about the fire department, it's obvious that she was less concerned about the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5058.392s">And</a> it's quite obvious by this particular writing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5061.254s">And</a> it's more obvious because of the fact that no one from rank and file of the police union were part and parcel of where we're going with all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5069.619s">Second</a> thing, as it relates to the location or relocation possibly of a new fire station, the chief is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5076.544s">He</a> can answer for himself. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5077.525s">But</a> last night, he indicated that the present location is the best place for the fire <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5082.952s">location</a> here in the city of Medford for its headquarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5085.593s">So</a> we take that into consideration because the talk seems to be supposedly getting a new fire station at a new location at a later time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5094.175s">And</a> then we go to point number four where the mayor says she's going to submit a loan order no later than the 2019 fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5102.697s">That</a> brings you up to May of June of 2020, no later than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5108.119s">But</a> all you're going to be getting <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5109.678s">is</a> allegedly a proposal for one, a new station. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5113.68s">And</a> number two, you know, maybe what the cost is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5117.142s">There's</a> no proviso in here as it's going to relate to how it's going to be paid for, whether it's going to be the Medford taxpayer, because we know right now there's no grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5126.267s">She's</a> still looking for grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5127.508s">As</a> she said last night, she's on the hunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5129.609s">And</a> in some places there's no grants to be found. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5132.651s">So</a> you're looking at Mr. And Mrs. Medford taxpayer who seems to be the person that's going to be paying it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5138.076s">So</a> I think you have some financial concerns that really need to be taken into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5142.638s">Nothing</a> that's been discussed right now is an obligation of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5146.08s">It's</a> a, is it's approximate $28 million pension deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5150.182s">You</a> folks haven't mentioned that yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5151.723s">And</a> there's no upticking on paying that down at a faster rate because the interest rates keep going higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5158.166s">The</a> other night there was a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5159.507s">There</a> was a car, excuse me, there was a meeting as it relates to a multimillion dollar refurbishing of Medford high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5166.802s">It's</a> going to cost factor that's going to have to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5169.604s">Most</a> recently, this council voted on, and excitedly, for the Medford Library and a $20 million bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5175.508s">And</a> if that comes through, there's a 40% payback on the city side. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5179.791s">These</a> are things that really have to be taken into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5182.954s">And</a> you, President Caraviello, in your first term, on the second year of your first term, you introduced a document that talked about $1.3 million of necessary repairs on the six new schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5193.441s">That's</a> up to almost $1.5 million right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5196.724s">This</a> city has a bad history of taking care of its buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5199.805s">The</a> private administration ignored all these buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5202.985s">This</a> city council is now being faced with altogether, all at once, a whole host of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5209.527s">It's</a> obvious that the priorities have not been set. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5212.507s">But</a> the priorities of this particular mayor, her little baby, being this police department thing, and now with the fire department thrown in, she should be here discussing this and making her plea with you folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5224.63s">This</a> is totally unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5226.91s">You</a> folks have never had an opportunity to discuss this issue, nevermind the location, nevermind the 35,000 square foot building, nevermind a three story building, nevermind the fact that if you put a combined operation there, according to Dunn and Sweeney, it won't even fit today's standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5243.457s">And</a> if you look at the 600 plus pages of the report, it alludes to the fact that even if you were to build a new police station and leave the fire station alone, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5251.981s">what</a> you're going to have is you're going to have mechanical problems that also will have code problems that will not bone up for the next 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5259.764s">And</a> that's going to be a cost factor to take into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5263.105s">If</a> you're talking about a possible 10 to 18 month period or 10 to 12 month period for a designer to come in and an OPM person hired first, everyone keeps forgetting to say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5273.789s">The</a> OPM needs to be hired first. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5276.389s">Once</a> you put that together, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5278.763s">Why</a> wait and do an 18-month period for the fire? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5281.084s">Why</a> can't you do both at the same time? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5283.505s">And</a> if you do both at the same time, maybe you can work out a process that basically says you can build this station in increments as it relates to building a new police station and then working on the fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5296.21s">Because</a> we all know on the fire station side of the building, the building is probably in better shape and a better condition than the police side. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5302.621s">But</a> who's to say it isn't because nobody's gone through there and council logo hit it right in the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5306.504s">Maybe</a> you should go in there and have any equality. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5308.386s">Maybe</a> that building should be reviewed for his aesthetic qualities and whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5313.37s">You</a> know, running around, not having any money from the outside and only dealing with nine, approximately $9 million in your free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5321.317s">That</a> doesn't leave, that doesn't leave an awful lot because then we can talk about your almost $8 million that you have in your water and sewer account for which Mr. And Mrs. Medford taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5331.39s">has</a> been paying for, and a surplus just sits there, and there is no ongoing proposed work. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5336.912s">And</a> you're hitting the taxpayers with that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5339.233s">You're</a> also hitting the taxpayer with the CPA, the Community Preservation Act, which in effect is almost $1 million plus you're taking away from the taxpayers, and there is no known program for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5350.978s">So</a> how much can you keep going back to Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer and say to them, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5355.72s">We're</a> charging you for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5357.1s">This</a> is what the cost is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5358.961s">And</a> readily acknowledged by our own treasurer, the fact of the matter is there's going to be some deficit mode as you continue to go forward that's going to have to be offset. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5367.524s">Who's</a> going to pay for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5369.024s">Do</a> you really want to tell the taxpayer you need a Proposition 2.5 override? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5373.766s">Do</a> you really want to sell that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5375.766s">And</a> if everything comes before you, Mr. President, and before your council, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5379.419s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5380.159s">Where's</a> the conversation as it relates to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5382.721s">Where's</a> the priority going to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5383.982s">Is</a> it going to be the high school? <a

href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5387.904s">Is</a> it going to be the fire station? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5389.945s">The</a> fire chief made an excellent point, something I never even thought of, and thank you for bringing it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5394.748s">Talking</a> about storage. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5396.77s">If</a> you can't even store what you have on the property that you have right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5401.18s">Where</a> in God's creation are you going to put that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5403.322s">He</a> said possibly auctioning it off. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5404.883s">Two</a> bays you're going to possibly be losing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5407.284s">You</a> talked about regionalization the other night. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5409.426s">The</a> mayor readily said that we could possibly go to regionalization. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5413.149s">And</a> I believe we heard the fire department indicate and say to you that if we did go to regionalization and we did take one of our trucks and a group of our guys to go there, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5420.674s">and</a> to do whatever it might takes place at one of these fire academies, so to speak, there needs to be a backup here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5427.556s">And</a> where's the backup to the backup in the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5429.637s">God</a> forbid there's a major fire that takes place. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5432.418s">These</a> are things that haven't been discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5434.438s">That's</a> what you folks should be discussing before you rush into this thing and say we want to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5439.18s">There</a> is nobody, not one person in this room that would be against a fire in the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5443.321s">I</a> don't think there's anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5444.222s">It</a> would all be crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5445.682s">if</a> there was one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5446.663s">We</a> all recognize the fact that the need is there, but we also recognize the fact that the city has been extremely diligent in not maintaining its buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5454.849s">But</a> there needs to be a priority that's set. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5457.532s">There</a> has to be a goal set here, and there has to be a timeline met. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5461.575s">And</a> if it's 2022 that was stated last night, now it's up to 2024 before you start to be making these paybacks, what's the cost going to be as it relates to the new station? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5472.804s">Mr.</a> McCulloch made an excellent point. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5474.785s">And</a> the point is simply this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5476.567s">If</a> you have to buy another piece of property for $10 million, is the at-present property worth $10 million? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5481.551s">Are</a> thereabouts? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5482.612s">And</a> if it isn't, but it comes close to it, and between the sale and the taxes that it generates, it offsets the cost of where you might be going. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5490.298s">These</a> are things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5491.038s">And</a> I thank you folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5491.839s">I</a> think it was you, Councilor Lungo-Koehn, who asked to maybe go into executive session to find out who are these other people that the city sat down and spoke with as it relates to possibly moving it around. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5502.823s">You</a> seem to forget one thing as it relates to where the public works department is, because we can't put any equipment in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5508.907s">But</a> the new public works building was being discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5511.369s">What</a> was discussed before this council was building something that could be oversized, not only to handle public works, but to handle our other buildings, whether it be our fire trucks, our police cars, and whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5523.236s">And</a> there was a pushback by the then administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5526.058s">Why</a> there was a pushback, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5528.12s">And</a> there was also a thought process that told us we could just wrap the whole thing around public works, fire, and police. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5534.506s">And</a> all you would be doing is asking and moving people that are presently there without taking their property, moving their property, so nobody would lose any space. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5542.694s">As</a> a matter of fact, they'd probably have better space, they'd have front view space, but you'd still have the availability of a fire department that's right there in the middle of the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5551.982s">Police</a> department, maybe move back a little bit one way or the other, but they can get around with their cars a lot quicker than a fire truck could. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5559.27s">I</a> don't think you should make a mistake by saying, no, we're not going to vote for this or yes, we're going to vote for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5564.694s">It's</a> the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5566.315s">And</a> once again, the process has been broken down. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5569.116s">It's</a> been broken down because there's been no communication, a lack of leadership from the mayor's office with this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5575.661s">And</a> all you folks are being required to do is to vote for this thing up and down with absolutely not an ounce of input. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5582.594s">And</a> today is another perfect example of what took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5585.455s">If</a> the fire department can meet with the mayor to get this resolution between themselves, then why wasn't the council involved before or after? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5594.978s">And</a> who's to say that this mayor is going to be here in 18 months? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5599.34s">That's</a> the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5600.841s">And</a> that's what you need to ask yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5602.763s">So</a> why are you going out on 18 months when in fact, if you're going to be doing this thing for a police department, why don't you do it for a fire department at the same time? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5611.41s">That</a> way they'll have a better understanding and a better acknowledgement to the fact where the fire and police can be housed together like they were in 1962 and like the report said. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5621.058s">That</a> report of multiple pages from Dunham and Sweeney going back to 2013 is probably the best example that you can have to tell you and to show you why a dual building should work. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5632.187s">But</a> if not, and you decide to go separately in a separate way, that generates and should generate positive discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5638.832s">And</a> one last thing for Mr. Falco, Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5641.954s">When</a> you talked about that training tower, while it seems to be something that, you know, it's going to be there and might cost $500,000, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5649.8s">But</a> where in the city is it going to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5651.921s">And</a> you don't want that to be regionalized. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5653.422s">Because</a> if you want that regionalized, you're taking firefighters out of service, out of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5657.803s">You're</a> taking a truck out of our service, out of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5660.364s">You're</a> putting backup there, and there's nobody there for the backup. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5663.706s">And</a> that's the problem that we're going to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5665.187s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5665.827s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2324.719s">Name</a> and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2326.06s">Good</a> evening, ladies and gentlemen. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2327.181s">My</a> name is Robert Penter, former member of the Zargas Party, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2333.064s">I'd</a> like to go over some points that were brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2334.645s">Unfortunately,</a> the whole meeting wasn't televised. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2337.907s">But</a> it was probably a misreading on your part, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2341.553s">It's</a> not a 3,500 square foot building. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2343.794s">It's</a> a 35,000 square foot building. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2346.536s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2347.297s">Number</a> two, in the report, it states it's going to be three stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2351.799s">And</a> our good friend, the city solicitor has been quoted by saying that the mayor said she has decided where the building is going to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2358.823s">The</a> sad part about this whole commentary is the mayor is proposing an excess of a 22 and a half million. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2365.788s">And</a> we don't even know what the contingencies might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2368.629s">proposal</a> here for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2370.33s">This</a> present city council, this will be the largest financial bonding that you folks are going to be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2376.013s">And</a> because of that, and because of that, I agree with Councilor Marks, the mayor should be here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2380.275s">This</a> is her proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2382.076s">Because</a> when she announced when she was campaigning, it would be seven to eight years. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2386.178s">How</a> it got sped up to this point, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2388.52s">But</a> thankfully because of the police department going out there and having their demonstrations and speaking up <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2395.753s">and</a> folks coming forward saying it's about time. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2398.815s">But</a> there are some issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2399.795s">Councilor</a> Lungo-Koehn is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2401.596s">You</a> don't have any report in front of you that talks about dates, places, people that you met with, whoever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2407.359s">And</a> if some of the landowners that were supposed to have met with the city did not want their names mentioned, you could go into an executive session and that would protect it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2416.204s">At</a> least you would have an idea who they were, where the locations might have been. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2420.806s">There</a> wasn't one police union representative on this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2425.4s">So</a> what does that tell you there? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2426.841s">Where</a> was their involvement on this particular location for whatever it might be? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2432.083s">The</a> other part about it is the city council, you folks had no involvement at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2435.484s">You're</a> hearing about it for the first time last week and at 10 o'clock last week, you get a phone call or an email saying there's a press announcement the next day. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2443.368s">That's</a> great for transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2445.369s">This</a> administration was going to be so transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2448.37s">It's</a> about as transparent as this rug on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2451.995s">More</a> importantly, going forward, the fire chief not being involved, not even being consulted. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2457.818s">I</a> can't answer for the chief of police, because I did speak with him last Tuesday night at the council meeting, and there was going to be an announcement the next day. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2465.381s">Whether</a> he knew what the announcement was or not, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2468.803s">We</a> didn't get to the finality of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2470.584s">But</a> if the fire department, like they are here tonight, have a particular purpose to this thing, then it should be brought into play. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2478.067s">Now</a> let's talk about the bonding. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2479.92s">because</a> if you get into the Dun and Sweeney report, which is dated January of 2013, <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2484.783s">as</a> Councilor Marks has alluded to. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2486.824s">There</a> is a funding mechanism here that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2489.384s">And</a> the funding mechanism that needs to be addressed is that if you leave that fire department alone, the way it is right now, and just go with a police department, you have a bonding situation for which this city council is going to be paying for whatever the rate's gonna be to bond the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2504.809s">But</a> over the next 20 years in the life of the bond, that Medford Fire Department and its headquarters are not going to be up to code. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2511.151s">mechanically,</a> electrically, and whatever else is needed by the standards as we go further in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2516.934s">So</a> to take into consideration the possibility of having a police and a fire department put together, or mixing the two together, how these two buildings can merge themselves together, how you can add or subtract to it, that should be the discussion before you say the final, the police department, that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2535.244s">Isn't</a> it best to sit down and discuss these things? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2538.347s">rather</a> than she made the decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2540.59s">Who</a> is she to make the decision with the taxpayer's money and then she puts you guys in a corner and girls in a corner, boxing you in like a rubber stamp. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2549.561s">If</a> you don't vote for it, that means you're against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2551.423s">That's</a> not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2552.885s">What's</a> true is you should be a part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2555.068s">We're</a> all part of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2556.91s">whether</a> we're a taxpaying citizen, an elected official, the mayor, whoever we're being. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2562.153s">But</a> more importantly, you have fire and police out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2565.274s">And</a> to some degree, they are divided. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2567.035s">Because</a> you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2568.176s">The</a> fire department is starting to realize things that they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2571.237s">Just</a> because there's a $2,500,000 inclusion in the capital improvement program, what does that say? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2577.28s">Where</a> is that going? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2578.341s">How</a> does that affect them on their side of the building? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2581.625s">You</a> just gave over $300,000 a few weeks ago for their turnout gear, but they've only got one set of washing machines. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2589.27s">6,</a> 3, and 2, if I understand those bond houses, 6, 3, and 2 would like to have washing machines that are very expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2597.516s">Well,</a> why wasn't that brought up as a subject matter? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2600.518s">Is</a> that gonna be something that's gonna be a challenge? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2603.119s">Well,</a> I would hope not. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2604.6s">You</a> pay for one thing, but you don't pay for another. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2607.662s">Another</a> thing is there is absolutely no detailed analysis. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2612.568s">The</a> city treasurer is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2613.988s">She</a> has not presented, neither has the mayor presented you a detailed analysis of bonds that are going to be terminating. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2620.85s">And</a> by those bonds terminating, the city can just transfer themselves over to paying the same amount that those bonds were paying that would pay for this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2630.152s">I</a> want to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2631.572s">As</a> a taxpayer and as an elected official, you need to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2635.913s">Because</a> is the city saying your taxes won't go up? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2640.475s">Your</a> rates won't go up because of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2643.219s">And</a> where is all the grants from the federal government and the state? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2647.843s">The</a> city of Malden got $9 million in grants before they started their project to build an $18 million building. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2654.029s">Where</a> is the one grant from the federal government or the Commonwealth of Massachusetts? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2657.952s">Has</a> anyone received one? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2659.393s">Have</a> you become aware of it? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2661.275s">You</a> don't even know if they've even applied for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2663.736s">It</a> would have nice to know that if you had a sense of conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2667.3s">And</a> if you, Mr. President, being the leader of this body, had the mayor invited you in at least at minimum to have a conversation about this, you could at least bring some information back. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2677.09s">But</a> she shut you out too, which is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2680.433s">You</a> can't do it by yourself, your own way. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2684.518s">You</a> know, <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2685.839s">You</a> get elected to do a job. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2687.841s">You</a> talk about being transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2689.802s">You</a> talk about being independent voices. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2692.425s">How</a> can you be an independent voice if you shut out, if you're not part of the situation, you're not part of the process? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2699.49s">You</a> know, we spent $110,000 for a Denham and Sweeney's report in January of 2013 that was presented to the council in 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2709.045s">You</a> had a Committee of the Whole meeting where there were a lot of issues that were brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2712.467s">And</a> I don't think any one fireman or any one police woman or lady, police man or lady, excuse me, or a fire lady and a fireman, I don't think they want to see any division between and amongst themselves, because I certainly don't want it, and I don't think the city needs it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2726.095s">But</a> this is crunch time right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2728.057s">You're</a> talking about a subject matter that's now involving both fire and police. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2733.58s">And</a> unless the city administration says that the fire department is not going to be involved in this, this is just a police issue, a police building issue, and a police department issue, then I think you have a problem, because the problem is now presenting itself before you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2748.071s">The</a> report talks about a merger of the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2751.153s">It</a> talks about the irregular space that you have over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2753.995s">It</a> also talks about having a minimum of three and a half acres to have a modern, up-to-date fire and police department that can take you into the next generation. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2762.725s">You're</a> only dealing with more than two and a half acres of land. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2765.626s">So</a> your space requirements are already confined. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2768.447s">And</a> to build a three and a half story building, who made that determination? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2772.028s">Where's</a> the parking facility going to go? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2774.109s">And</a> if you're going to have a schematic design? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2776.37s">You</a> talk about something that's going to take place over the next six to eight months. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2779.671s">Six</a> to eight months are going to prove to be what? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2781.331s">You're</a> going to go out there for a design. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2782.612s">But</a> to get to the six to eight months, you guys have to make a decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2785.633s">You're</a> going to have to agree and disagree on things. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2787.593s">And</a> you're going to have to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2788.734s">And</a> you're going to have to have people input, your input. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2793.322s">Taxpayers'</a> input, it's their money. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2796.523s">It's</a> the taxpayers' money. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2798.183s">And</a> I can guarantee that every single police officer and every single fireperson can come up to this podium and say that they need what they need to do their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2807.266s">They</a> should not be denied, but they should have the option of knowing that every conceivable option was presented and discussed and voted upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2815.669s">It</a> wasn't squirreled into a particular corner, a particular group, on a particular day, and then we'll talk about the next issue on another day. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2823.458s">The</a> stupidest way to waste money is to spend it recklessly. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2827.663s">And</a> right now, I think you would be doing that before you sit down and take into consideration all the needs that are out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2834.311s">Why</a> would the capital improvement program have a $2.5 million inclusion for the fire department? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2840.078s">without</a> you folks knowing about it, but you're dealing with a $2 million requirement to go out there and have a schematic design, and then a $20 million to build a building, and how do you know if that building, in effect, is gonna have any effect at all on the fire department, or vice versa? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2853.964s">You</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2855.524s">You</a> know, we live in a great city. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2857.405s">We</a> have a great group of people in here, and we all wanna do the right thing, the best thing for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2862.687s">But</a> we need to be smart, and we need to be inclusive, and we need to be, <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2867.243s">understanding</a> that we all can't think the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2870.226s">But</a> if you can't think the same way without having an opportunity to talk about it, you'll never be able to accomplish anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2877.093s">Today</a> is Valentine's Day, and I wish you all a happy Valentine's Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2881.577s">But</a> with the white Christmas lights outside, I'm a little bit confused, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2888.443s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2889.304s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3997.699s">Name</a> and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3999.02s">Good</a> evening, ladies and gentlemen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4000.141s">My</a> name is Robert Penta, former member of the Zargas body, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4006.044s">I'd</a> like to go over some points that were brought up before the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4009.045s">The</a> whole meeting wasn't televised, but it was probably a misreading on your part, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4014.548s">It's</a> not a 3,500 square foot building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4016.769s">It's</a> a 35,000 square foot building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4019.51s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4020.271s">Number</a> two, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4021.379s">uh,</a> in the report, it states it's going to be three story. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4024.76s">And</a> our good friend, the city solicitor has been quoted by saying that the mayor said she has decided where the building is going to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4031.782s">The</a> sad part about this whole commentary is the mayor is proposing two and a half million. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4038.743s">And</a> we don't even know what the contingencies might be proposal here for the city of method. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4043.305s">This</a> present city council, this will be the largest financial bonding that you folks are going to be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4048.994s">And</a> because of that, and because of that, I agree with Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4051.955s">The</a> mayor should be here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4053.236s">This</a> is her proposal because when she announced when she was campaigning, it would be seven to eight years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4059.158s">Howard</a> got sped up to this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4060.698s">I</a> don't know, but thankfully because of the police department going out there and, uh, and, and having their demonstrations and speaking up and folks coming forward saying it's about time, but there are some issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4072.782s">Counsel</a> Lungo-Koehn is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4074.583s">You</a> don't have any report in front of you that talks about dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4077.628s">places,</a> people that you met with, whoever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4080.33s">And</a> if some of the landowners that were supposed to have met with the city did not want their names mentioned, you could go into an executive session and that would protect it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4089.175s">At</a> least you would have an idea who they were, where the locations might've been. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4093.778s">There</a> wasn't one police union representative committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4098.381s">So</a> what does that tell you there? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4099.822s">Where</a> was their involvement on this particular location for whatever it might be? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4105.08s">The</a> other part about it is the city council, you folks had no involvement at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4108.463s">You're</a> hearing about it for the first time last week and at 10 o'clock last week, you get a phone call or an email saying there's a press announcement the next day. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4116.349s">That's</a> great for transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4118.35s">This</a> administration was going to be so transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4121.353s">It's</a> about as transparent as this rug on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4124.996s">More</a> importantly, going forward, the fire chief not being involved, not even being consulted. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4130.82s">I</a> can't answer for the chief of police because I did speak with him last Tuesday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4134.767s">at</a> the council meeting and there was going to be an announcement the next day, whether he knew what the announcement was or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4140.949s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4141.789s">We</a> didn't get to the finality of it, but if the fire department, like I have a particular purpose to this thing, then it should be brought into play. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4151.052s">Now</a> let's talk about the bonding, because if you get into the Dun and Sweeney report, which is dated January, 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4157.767s">as</a> Councilor Marks has alluded to, there is a funding mechanism here that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4162.369s">And</a> the funding mechanism that needs to be addressed is that if you leave that fire department alone, the way it is right now, and just go with a police department, you have a bonding situation for which this city council is going to be paying for whatever the rate's going to be to bond the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4177.795s">But</a> over the next 20 years in the life of the bond, that Medford Fire Department and its headquarters are not going to be up to code. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4184.138s">mechanically,</a> electrically, and whatever else is needed by the standards as we go further in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4189.9s">So</a> to take into consideration the possibility of having a police and a fire department put together or mixing the two together, how these two buildings can merge themselves together, how you can add or subtract to it, that should be the discussion before you say the final, the police department, that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4208.21s">Isn't</a> it best to sit down and discuss these things rather than she made the decision? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4213.581s">Who</a> is she to make the decision with the taxpayer's money and that she puts you guys in a corner and girls in a corner? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4220.421s">boxing</a> you in, like a rubber stamp. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4222.543s">If</a> you don't vote for it, that means you're against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4224.384s">That's</a> not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4225.845s">What's</a> true is you should be a part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4228.027s">We're</a> all part of this, whether we're a taxpaying citizen, an elected official, the mayor, whoever we're be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4235.133s">But</a> more importantly, you have fire and police out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4238.276s">And</a> to some degree, they are divided. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4240.037s">Because</a> you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4241.178s">The</a> fire department is starting to realize things that they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4244.241s">Just</a> because there's a $2,500,000 inclusion in the capital <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4248.524s">program,</a> what does that say? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4250.247s">Where</a> is that going? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4251.329s">How</a> does that affect them on their side of the building? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4254.615s">You</a> just gave over $300,000 a few weeks ago for their turnout gear, but they've only got one set of washing machines. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4262.243s">6,</a> 3, and 2, if I understand those bond houses, 6, 3, and 2 would like to have washing machines that are very expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4270.489s">Well,</a> why wasn't that brought up as a subject matter? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4273.491s">Is</a> that going to be something that's going to be a challenge? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4276.092s">Well,</a> I would hope not. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4277.553s">You</a> pay for one thing, but you don't pay for another. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4280.575s">Another</a> thing is there is absolutely no detailed analysis. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4285.488s">The</a> city treasurer is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4286.909s">She</a> has not presented, neither has the mayor presented you a detailed analysis of bonds that are going to be terminating. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4293.772s">And</a> by those bonds terminating, the city can just transfer themselves over to paying the same amount that those bonds were paying that would pay for this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4303.077s">I</a> want to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4304.558s">As</a> a taxpayer and as an elected official, you need to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4308.9s">Because</a> is the city saying your taxes won't go up? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4313.462s">Your</a> rates won't go up because of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4316.207s">And</a> where is all the grants from the federal government and the state? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4320.831s">The</a> city of Malden got $9 million in grants before they started their project to build an $18 million building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4327.016s">Where</a> is the one grant from the federal government or the Commonwealth of Massachusetts? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4330.959s">Has</a> anyone received one? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4332.381s">Have</a> you become aware of it? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4334.282s">You</a> don't even know if they've even applied for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4336.723s">It</a> would have nice to know that if you had a sense of conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4340.285s">And</a> if you, Mr. President, being the leader of this body, had the mayor invited you in at least at minimum to have a conversation about this, you could at least bring some information back. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4350.072s">But</a> she shut you out too, which is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4353.435s">You</a> can't do it by yourself, your own way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4357.497s">You</a> know, you get elected to do a job. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4361.982s">transparent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4362.783s">You</a> talk about being independent voices. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4365.424s">How</a> can you be an independent voice if you shut out, if you're not part of the situation, you're not part of the process? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4372.49s">You</a> know, we spent dollars for a Denham and Sweeney's report in January of 2013 that was presented to the council in 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4382.056s">You</a> had a committee of the whole meeting where there were a lot of issues that were brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4385.479s">And</a> I don't think any one fireman or any one policewoman <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4389.539s">police</a> man or lady, excuse me, or a fire lady and a fireman. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4393.2s">I</a> don't think they want to see any division between and amongst themselves, because I certainly don't want it, and I don't think the city needs it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4399.082s">But</a> this is crunch time right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4401.043s">You're</a> talking about a subject matter that's now involving both fire and police. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4406.565s">And</a> unless the city administration says that the fire department is not going to be involved in this, this is just a police issue, a police building issue, and a police department issue, then I think you have a problem, because the problem is now presenting itself before you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4421.075s">The</a> report talks about a merger of the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4424.157s">It</a> talks about the irregular space that you have over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4426.999s">It</a> also talks about having a minimum of three and a half acres to have a modern, up-to-date fire and police department that can take you into the next generation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4435.712s">You're</a> only dealing with more than two and a half acres of land. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4438.633s">So</a> your space requirements are already confirmed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4441.434s">And</a> to build a three and a half story building, who made that determination? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4445.036s">Where's</a> the parking facility going to go? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4447.097s">And</a> if you're going to have a schematic design, you talk about something that's going to take place over the next six to eight months. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4452.659s">Six</a> to eight months are going to prove to be what? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4454.339s">You're</a> going to go out there for a design. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4455.62s">But</a> to get to the six to eight months, you guys have to make a decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4458.641s">You're</a> going to have to agree and disagree on things. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4460.582s">And</a> you're going to have to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4461.742s">And</a> you're going to have to have people input, your input. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4466.296s">Taxpayers'</a> input. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4467.677s">It's</a> their money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4469.478s">It's</a> the taxpayers' money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4471.158s">And</a> I can guarantee that every single police officer and every single fireperson can come up to this podium and say that they need what they need to do their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4480.243s">They</a> should not be denied, but they should have the option of knowing that every conceivable option was presented and discussed and voted upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4488.627s">It</a> wasn't squirreled into a particular corner, a particular group, on a particular day, and then we'll talk about the next issue on another day. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4496.432s">The</a> stupidest way to waste money is to spend it recklessly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4500.614s">And</a> right now, I think you would be doing that before you sit down and take into consideration all the needs that are out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4507.256s">Why</a> would the capital improvement program have a $2.5 million inclusion in the fire department? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4513.05s">without</a> you folks knowing about it, but you're dealing with a $2 million requirement to go out there and have a schematic design, and then a $20 million to build a building, and how do you know if that building, in effect, is gonna have any effect at all on the fire department, or vice versa? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4526.914s">You</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4528.495s">You</a> know, we live in a great city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4530.355s">We</a> have a great group of people in here, and we all wanna do the right thing, the best thing for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4535.637s">But</a> we need to be smart, and we need to be inclusive, and we need to be, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4540.197s">understanding</a> that we all can't think the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4543.199s">But</a> if you can't think the same way without having an opportunity to talk about it, you'll never be able to accomplish anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4550.062s">Today</a> is Valentine's Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4551.943s">And</a> I wish you all a happy Valentine's Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4554.524s">But</a> with the white Christmas lights outside, I'm a little bit confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4558.026s">OK?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4561.407s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4562.248s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2552.378s">My</a> name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of the Saugus party. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2557.86s">I</a> don't have any problems with the requests that are being made, but my problem is in the process that's being presented here to you this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2565.735s">What</a> seems to be unfamiliar is the fact that this present administration talked about this issue of inclusion and being a part of what's taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2574.917s">You</a> have the police, the forestry, the engineering department, the cemetery, the highway, and the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2580.618s">Six</a> departments that you folks, during budgetary time, have heard all of these concerns that are being presented here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2588.06s">And</a> as a matter of fact, it goes back to the times when I served in this body where some of these issues were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2593.283s">This</a> money is coming out of free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2595.445s">And</a> because it's coming out of free cash, which was asked for before, you folks were told, or we were told, as well as you folks were told, at some point in time, we can't use it because it might have an effect upon the bond rating here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2607.315s">Now,</a> all of a sudden, it's coming out as a $1,100,000 transfer of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2613.2s">And</a> tomorrow night, Madam Mayor is going to be making her presentation for the State of the City's Address. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2620.357s">My</a> concern would be if there are more things that are going to be coming that's going to have a cost impact upon not only free cash or maybe even bonding, I think before this vote takes place, I think it probably should be laid on the table for one week, as Councilor Lungo-Koehn rightly did some weeks ago on the request of the $900,000 to have some transfer of money from the Water and Sewer Account to pay for the remediation of the West Medford parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2646.471s">Now,</a> you folks have your own rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2648.805s">and</a> it's rule number 20, section number four, which states that any finance paper appearing on the council agenda for the first time shall be automatically laid on the table for one week when such action is requested by any councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2662.451s">I</a> would think it would be wise by this city council, I'm not saying for you to not vote for it or vote for it, I think it would be wise to lay it on the table for a week and just see what's going to be presented tomorrow night in the state of the city's address. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2674.396s">You</a> folks, unfortunately, have been kept not in the loop. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2678.427s">Everything</a> that's being presented here has nothing to do with you folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2681.829s">You</a> folks have never met with all the department heads to go through their wish lists. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2686.332s">That</a> was something that was discussed during this past election, and it still hasn't taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2691.235s">A</a> magnificence of $1 million here tonight, and the mayor's representative is not here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2697.239s">That</a> doesn't speak well. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2699.32s">One</a> information council tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2700.501s">I</a> believe the mayor has four representatives here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2703.372s">The</a> mayor's liaison to the City Council is not here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2706.974s">Department</a> heads might be here, but they're not the ones that bring the message back. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2710.675s">You</a> know, when you go back and you look at some of these things and you say to yourself, the chief of police just thought through saying six cruises, six new, six regular cars and six cars that are going to be unmarked. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2722.001s">I</a> think this council in the past has asked for each and every year, <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2725.046s">Chief,</a> you can correct me, for a minimum of two new cars each and every year in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2729.427s">This</a> should have been, you folks should have been dealing with this within the past year, if not more. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2733.948s">And</a> you're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2734.908s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2735.528s">My</a> opinion, and it's election year. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2737.308s">And</a> you're getting all this confronted in front of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2739.469s">You're</a> gonna be getting sidewalks, you're gonna be getting streets, all done. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2743.269s">But</a> where was this money not being used during this past year? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2746.99s">During</a> a year which people had to suffer to go through this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2750.131s">Why</a> should the fire department have to wait? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2752.663s">on</a> their turnaround gear that they were promised not only last year but the year before. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2756.628s">And</a> now all of a sudden it's found in a free cash supplement when it could have been at the same time taken out of free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2763.075s">It</a> could have been taken out as of January 1st with the new administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2767.24s">The</a> politics behind this is quite obvious. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2769.783s">But</a> even more to the politics of it is tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2773.157s">My</a> suggestion would be to wait until tomorrow night, see what this address is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2777.222s">And</a> if the address has inclusions of other transfers of money or monies that have to go out for the purposes of being bonded, I think you really need to have a discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2786.833s">And</a> you, Mr. President, you know, amongst this council, there's $210,000 a year paid in salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2793.367s">The</a> executive office, the mayor only gets paid $140,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2797.67s">So</a> there's more power strength here by what you are getting paid than what that corner office is getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2803.874s">And</a> you should put that to use. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2805.615s">And</a> if four of you get together and saying, hey, before we start expending these monies, just right off the hat, Councilor Marks, you've asked for two years in a row for a truck division within the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2816.443s">Nowhere</a> is that found here, and nowhere is it found in the capital improvement plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2821.246s">Think</a> about it, in today's day and age, you're talking about email now being in the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2826.85s">I</a> don't even know if they have email in the police department, but if the fire department is now getting email, and they're supposed to be technologically up to snuff here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2835.096s">We</a> should have the gentleman who runs your computer system down here, and he should be questioned as to what are the problems, and what is the technology needed within this city of Medford, whether it be the fire department, school department, or the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2847.91s">You</a> haven't had that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2850.031s">There's</a> a wishlist that goes out every single year. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2852.273s">The</a> wishlist is never even addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2854.474s">You</a> just got through, Mr. President, talking about the scanner to the OCD, I mean, excuse me, the engineering office asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2860.597s">It's</a> a simple little request that could have come right out of free cash last year, two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2865.66s">As</a> a matter of fact, when the lady was there and she made her presentation before the council, she showed you emails that were sent, emails that were sent. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2874.755s">that</a> the administration wouldn't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2876.976s">So</a> what's being obvious is the fact that you're being asked to do something tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2881.558s">To</a> me, it looks like you're being squirreled into a corner, that if you don't vote for it, you're bad, and you're not doing what you've all been asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2888.462s">That's</a> not what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2889.742s">What</a> I'm saying is you have one more night to wait and see. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2892.864s">I</a> don't see this as being such an emergency that it needs to be voted on tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2897.046s">Your</a> own council rule says the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2899.847s">Lay</a> it on the table for one week, and if it comes out to be the same when you want to vote for it, go right ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2904.9s">But</a> tomorrow night, if the State of the Union address is going to have something that has another financial impact within this community, whether it's coming off of your free cash or a bond or whatever it might be, don't you think you owe it to yourselves as legislative representatives and to the people of this community to wait and see? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2924.125s">You've</a> waited all this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2926.567s">Pieces</a> have been taken out of a capital improvement program. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2930.029s">All</a> of a sudden, things that you've been asking for just coincidentally happens to be in your agenda tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2935.833s">Well,</a> I don't think that's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2937.174s">And</a> I think all seven of you should have been brought in to fold, whether you agree with the mayor or you don't agree with the mayor, whether she agrees with you or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2944.536s">This</a> is an important issue, many important issues here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2947.678s">This</a> isn't $10,000 or $15,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2950.08s">This</a> is a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2951.4s">And</a> the remaining balance of $8,600,000 is still there to be played with. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2957.184s">And</a> you have no idea what she's going to do with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2959.686s">That's</a> up to you folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2961.127s">And</a> if you folks can't put the mayor together and force that lady to sit down and talk with you, to turn around and say, hey, you may be picking out things that you need, but that's not what this council sees and hears from Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2974.593s">I</a> just respectfully state to you, follow your own council rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2978.075s">Hopefully</a> one of you will lay it on the table for one week, see what comes out tomorrow night, and recognize the fact that whatever your issues might be, they're addressed before this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2987.641s">You</a> know, you have a capital improvement program here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2989.822s">There's</a> a lot of things in this capital improvement program that also relates back to the fire department, the police department, some of them are in the school department, and what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2996.927s">It</a> would be nice to know <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2999.538s">Whether</a> a new police department is going to end the offering for tomorrow night, there's $2 million in there to figure out where they're going to put it, draw it, and all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3007.302s">If</a> you have sat down and talked with her or her people, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3010.503s">And</a> I think you should. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3011.924s">It's</a> the most pressing issue, the biggest, most pressing issue here financially for the city of Medford, and no discussion on it. <a

repeat. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3024.04s">I</a> am not against any of these transfers. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3025.781s">What</a> I'm against is the process, how it's

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2619.989s">My</a> name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of the Saugus party. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2625.471s">I</a> don't have any problems with the requests that are being made, but my problem is in the process that's being presented here to you this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2632.554s">Um,</a> what seems to be unfamiliar is the fact that this president administration talked about this issue <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2639.088s">of</a> inclusion and being a part of what's taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2642.53s">You</a> have the police, the forestry, the engineering department, the cemetery, the highway, and the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2648.235s">Six</a> departments that you folks during budgetary time have heard all of these concerns that are being presented here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2655.68s">And</a> as a matter of fact, it goes back to the times when I served in this body where some of these issues were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2660.903s">This</a> money is coming out of free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2663.085s">And</a> because it's coming out of free cash, which was asked for before, <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2666.52s">You</a> folks were told, or we were told, as well as you folks were told, at some point in time, we can't use it because it might have an effect upon the bond rating here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2674.925s">Now,</a> all of a sudden, it's coming out as a $1,100,000 transfer of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2680.809s">And</a> tomorrow night, Madam Mayor is going to be making her presentation for the State of the City's address. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2687.973s">My</a> concern would be, if there are more things that are going to be coming that's going to have a cost impact upon not only free cash or maybe even bonding, <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2696.524s">I</a> think before this vote takes place, I think it probably should be laid on the table for one week, as Councilor Lungo-Koehn rightly did some weeks ago on the request of the $900,000 to have some transfer of money from the Water and Sewer account to pay for the remediation of the West Method parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2714.09s">Now,</a> you folks have your own rules, and it's rule number 20, section number 4, which states that any finance paper appearing on the council agenda for the first time shall be automatically laid on the table for one week <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2726.916s">when</a> such action is requested by any Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2730.058s">I</a> would think it would be wise by this city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2732.48s">I'm</a> not saying for you to not vote for it or vote for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2734.702s">I</a> think it would be wise to lay it on the table for a week and just see what's going to be presented tomorrow night in the state of the city's address. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2742.007s">You</a> folks unfortunately have been kept in the loop, not in the loop. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2746.05s">Everything</a> that's being presented here has nothing to do with you folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2749.472s">You</a> folks have never met with all the department heads to go through their wishlist. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2753.933s">That</a> was something that was discussed during this past election, and it still hasn't taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2758.854s">A</a> magnificence of $1 million here tonight, and the mayor's representative is not here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2764.856s">That</a> doesn't speak well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2766.916s">One</a> information, Councilor Knight.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2771.697s">The</a> mayor's liaison to the city council is not here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2774.598s">Department</a> heads might be here, but they're not the ones that bring the message back. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2778.299s">You</a> know, when you go back and you look at some of these things, and you say to yourself, the chief of police just thought through saying, <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2783.507s">Six</a> cruises, six regular cars and six cars that are going to be unmarked. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2789.618s">I</a> think this council in the past has asked for each and every year, chief, you can correct me, for a minimum of two new cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2795.3s">each</a> and every year in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2797.042s">This</a> should have been, you folks should have been dealing with this within the past year, if not more, and you're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2802.528s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2803.148s">My</a> opinion, and it's election year, and you're getting all this confronted in front of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2807.093s">You're</a> gonna be getting sidewalks, you're gonna be getting streets, all done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2810.917s">But</a> where was this money not being used during this past year? <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2814.618s">during</a> a year which people had to suffer to go through this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2817.761s">Why</a> should the fire department have to wait on their turnaround year that they were promised not only last year but the year before? <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2824.247s">And</a> now all of a sudden it's found in a free cash supplement when it could have been at the same time taken out of free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2830.713s">It</a> could have been taken out as of January 1st with the new administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2834.856s">The</a> politics behind this is quite obvious. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2837.399s">But</a> even more to the politics of it is tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2840.795s">My</a> suggestion would be to wait till tomorrow night, see what this address is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2844.838s">And</a> if the address has inclusions of other transfers of money or monies that have to go out for the purposes of being bonded, I think you really need to have a discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2854.445s">And</a> you, Mr. President, you know, amongst this council, there's $210,000 a year paid in salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2860.988s">The</a> executive office, the mayor only gets paid $140,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2865.31s">So</a> there's more power strength here by what you are getting paid than what that corner office is getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2871.513s">And</a> you should put that to use. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2873.234s">And</a> if four of you get together and saying, hey, before we start expending these monies, just right off the hat, Councilman Marks, you've asked for two years in a row for a truck division within the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2884.079s">Nowhere</a> is that found here, and nowhere is it found in the capital improvement plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2888.881s">Think</a> about it, in today's day and age, you're talking about email now being in the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2894.485s">I</a> don't even know if they have email in the police department, but if the fire department is now getting email, and they're supposed to be technologically up to snuff here, we should have the gentleman who runs your computer system down here, and he should be questioned as to what are the problems, and what is the technology needed within this city of Medford, whether it be the fire department, school department, or the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2915.545s">You</a> haven't had that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2917.666s">There's</a> a wishlist that goes out every single year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2919.908s">The</a> wishlist is never even addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2922.109s">You</a> just got through, Mr. President, talking about the scanners or the OCD, I mean, excuse me, the engineering office asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2928.232s">It's</a> a simple little request that could have come right out of free cash last year, two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2933.295s">As</a> a matter of fact, when the lady was there and she made her presentation before the council, she showed you emails that were sent, emails that were sent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2942.39s">that</a> the administration wouldn't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2944.611s">So</a> what's being obvious is the fact that you're being asked to do something tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2949.194s">To</a> me, it looks like you're being squirreled into a corner that if you don't vote for it, you're bad and you're not doing what you've all been asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2956.097s">That's</a> not what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2957.378s">What</a> I'm saying is you have one more night to wait and see. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2960.499s">I</a> don't see this as being such an emergency that it needs to be voted on tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2964.682s">Your</a> own council rule says the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2967.463s">Lay</a> it on the table for one week, and if it comes out to be the same when you want to vote for it, go right ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2972.528s">But</a> tomorrow night, if the State of the Union address is going to have something that has another financial impact within this community, whether it's coming off of your free cash or a bond or whatever it might be, don't you think you owe it to yourselves as legislative representatives and to the people of this community to wait and see? <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2991.765s">You've</a> waited all this time <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2994.202s">Pieces</a> have been taken out of a capital improvement program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2997.664s">All</a> of a sudden, things that you've been asking for just coincidentally happens to be in your agenda tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3003.466s">Well,</a> I don't think that's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3004.807s">And</a> I think all seven of you should have been brought in to fold, whether you agree with the mayor or you don't agree with the mayor, whether she agrees with you or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3012.171s">This</a> is an important issue, many important issues here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3015.313s">This</a> isn't $10,000 or $15,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3017.715s">This</a> is a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3019.036s">And</a> the remaining balance of $8,600,000 is still there to be played with. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3024.82s">And</a> you have no idea what she's going to do with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3027.322s">That's</a> up to you folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3028.763s">And</a> if you folks can't put the mayor together and force that lady to sit down and talk with you, to turn around and say, hey, you may be picking out things that you need, but that's not what this council sees and hears from Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3042.228s">I</a> just respectfully state to you, follow your own council rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3045.709s">Hopefully</a> one of you will lay it on the table for one week, see what comes out tomorrow night, and recognize the fact that whatever your issues might be, they're addressed before this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3055.272s">You</a> know, you have a capital improvement program here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3057.452s">There's</a> a lot of things in this capital improvement program that also relates back to the fire department, the police department, some of them are in the school department, and what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3064.554s">It</a> would be nice to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3067.153s">Whether</a> a new police department is going to end the offering for tomorrow night, there's $2 million in there to figure out where they're going to put it, draw it, and all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3074.938s">If</a> you have sat down and talked with her or her people, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3078.1s">And</a> I think you should. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3079.521s">It's</a> the most pressing issue, the biggest, most pressing issue here financially for the city of Medford, and no discussion on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3086.406s">But</a> you're getting over $1 million worth of transfers being asked for tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3090.548s">Again,</a> I repeat, I am not against any of these transfers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3093.39s">What</a> I'm against is the process, how it's being presented, <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3096.279s">and</a> the opportunity you have to make sure that before you vote for this, you see the complete and total picture, which I believe will be presented tomorrow evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3103.605s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2017-10-05_u7r73CCT980/2017-10-05_u7r73CCT980.html">Medford, MA City Council - Jan. 31, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4410.953s">Name</a> and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4412.134s">President,</a> my name is Robert Pence, zero summit road, and that's what mass from a member of the sluggish party. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4416.737s">Uh,</a> there might be a compromise to this situation that's being presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4420.24s">So</a> I know the committee did some hard work and I know this has been a subject matter of concern when I was serving on the council, but maybe rather than having the idea of submitting a document to the city clerk, um, I think you need to look at this at two points. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4435.111s">Number</a> one, what the university does on its own land, <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4438.905s">with</a> its own campus provisos for the students, it's no interest of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4443.927s">But</a> what they do off-campus by having off-campus locations for people to provide those locations is a concern to the city, and I believe the concern to the city should be placed on the homeowner or the landowner of where these students might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4458.674s">Councilor</a> Marks alluded to the idea of a violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4461.555s">If</a> in fact you get a document that gives you these locations of where these students are, I think it's incumbent <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4467.805s">for</a> the purposes of enforcement and having your teeth on the landowner who's collecting the rent from that student to have that student who's going to Tufts University be one of the students that's sitting in an off-campus position. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4481.511s">I</a> think that could bring you to the compromise of saying, rather than having your code enforcement officer go out, it's upon the landowner. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4489.715s">And</a> once that landowner is found in violation, then the city has its own teeth. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4495.051s">I</a> don't think anybody of you were on the council at the time, but we can go back a few years ago, and I think Barbara will remember this, where there was a student living in the garage roof in a particular location off campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4507.26s">And</a> I think that there was a huge settlement, and to the hundreds and thousands of dollars, I believe to the family of the student, unfortunately, who died there, but it was the city's responsibility, or should have been the city's responsibility, if we follow this train of thought, that the location did not provide <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4522.872s">the</a> safety and the security for that particular person. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4525.933s">I</a> offer that out as a compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4527.653s">I</a> think it would work, and I think it would be beneficial not only to all you folks, but to the community as a whole, because you're now putting everybody on notice that if you are going to take in campus students or off-college students off-campus, it's going to be their responsibility to adhere to all the rules and the regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4544.376s">And</a> any violation would be found right in the teeth of the, excuse me, in the teeth of the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4549.356s">And</a> I think that's satisfied making the presentation before the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4552.737s">They</a> make the presentation to the city building department on an annual basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4556.8s">And</a> from there, the city is on notice where these locations might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4560.362s">And</a> then it doesn't become a, a matter of public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4563.264s">It</a> becomes a matter of a public safety issue that the building department has the responsibility for. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4569.287s">So</a> I offer that out there as a compromise.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4981.635s">Name</a> and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4983.196s">Robert</a> Pinto zero summit road metron mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4985.418s">It's</a> quite obvious that this is not a new topic before this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4988.571s">When</a> I had served on this council some years back, I mean, this topic when Park Method first came in, had many, many flaws and many, many, how can you say? <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4997.694s">Many</a> things did not make people happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5000.756s">We</a> have heard week after week that there are concerns that need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5005.157s">Councilor</a> Lungo-Koehn has just brought up a few. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5007.438s">But</a> you also have the ones that basically tell you that common sense needs to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5014.121s">Two</a> particular instances, a gentleman with a handicapped plate <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5018.49s">gets</a> parked in the spot, provided for handicap and gets a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5023.674s">And</a> the argument is you were there more than the two hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5026.796s">Now</a> there is nothing in any of these rules that say a handicapped person is relegated to two hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5033.481s">Person</a> goes down to Park Medford, explains the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5036.142s">It</a> doesn't make any difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5037.704s">You</a> have to go and do an appeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5039.945s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5041.006s">Number</a> two, something similar to Councilor Lungo-Koehn alluded to, <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5044.323s">There</a> was a lady in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5045.544s">She</a> came with her baby, parked her car. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5048.606s">Now,</a> in some of these locations, you'll know there may be two or three or even four car lengths apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5053.849s">So</a> she parked maybe approximately four car lengths ahead of where the meter stand was. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5059.592s">She</a> gets out of the car. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5061.614s">She</a> hasn't even got to go get her ticket and come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5065.476s">And</a> the gentleman is there giving her a ticket, OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5068.378s">And</a> while she's giving the ticket, she said, I'm just, I had to go get the, <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5072.584s">had</a> to go pay the meter to park the ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5074.305s">Doesn't</a> make any difference, you don't have a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5076.286s">Now,</a> it's the common courtesy of common sense understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5079.709s">And</a> I think it was you, Councilor Marks, that might have alluded to in the beginning, there should be some sense of maybe of a 15 minute leeway when somebody goes to go and park, by the time they go park their car, go get a ticket and what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5091.916s">I</a> don't see anywhere, anything that even says that. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5097.04s">The</a> position that I think you folks have should be the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5099.541s">You</a> know, the company's been sold, <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5102.43s">It's</a> a new company that's come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5104.772s">I</a> think you folks have asked for a copy of the contract and I don't think you've gotten the contract yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5109.756s">It's</a> been well over a year and you haven't even gotten a copy of the financials. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5113.919s">How</a> many tickets have been issued? <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5115.12s">How</a> many tickets have been resolved? <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5116.962s">You</a> know, how much money's coming in? <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5119.844s">Where</a> did the $250,000 in the first year, where did that go? <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5122.786s">City</a> hasn't even reported back to you on where that might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5126.049s">I</a> think Park Method has done quite a bit on this new parking scheme to really hurt <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5132.079s">to</a> hurt the taxpayers and the business people of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5135.541s">We've</a> been told that seniors can park for nothing, but you have to pay $25 to park for nothing to get the permit for once a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5142.726s">And</a> you can't transfer it from one car to another, which, again, doesn't help a senior in that particular case. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5147.889s">You</a> can go down to Haines Square any time in the morning, and you can see just many, many more blank spaces than there have ever been before. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5153.453s">Go</a> to Medford Square in the morning, and the same situation happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5157.055s">I</a> think the problem here is that Park Medford is just not doing <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5160.831s">for</a> the city as what the city thought it would do for its taxpayers and more importantly for its business people. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5167.708s">So</a> I would suggest when you folks have your Committee of the Whole next meeting, I think it would be more appropriate to have a subsequent meeting here before the council where all the taxpayers can hear and see what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5178.055s">Because</a> a lot of people can't come to a Committee of the Whole meeting or a subcommittee meeting for whatever you want to call it. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5183.438s">This</a> is their public forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5184.519s">This</a> is something that has an impact on the entire city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5188.021s">Every</a> single business person and every single person that drives through this community has to be confronted with those stupid kiosks where you're supposed to go and pay, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5197.467s">with</a> situations as Council Member O'Connor had. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5200.248s">You</a> had a lady who gave me her ticket, and she had 10 minutes left on her ticket, and she still got a parking violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5207.31s">And</a> having to go, having to go give up her time, having to take time off from work, which means it could possibly be paid, vacation time, what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5215.772s">This</a> isn't right. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5216.752s">And</a> with the age of computer technology that we have here right now, if they can't resolve something that simple by going into the Park Medford office that can be resolved, this doesn't make any sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5227.896s">I</a> think it's an insult to the taxpayers and it's an insult to this council who unfortunately has to bear the burden of all these complaints because this is the situation that you're in right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5238.82s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2017-02-01_l57EqMhB2JU/2017-02-01_l57EqMhB2JU.html">Medford, MA City Council - Jan. 31, 2017 [Livestream] (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=758.25s">My</a> name is Robert Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=759.27s">I</a> live at Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., a former member of this august body. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=763.712s">In</a> May of 2016, when this issue appeared itself before the council, I came and I spoke and I relayed information for which I will again <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=771.171s">reaffirm</a> with you after speaking with Bond Council for the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=775.334s">The</a> City of Medford engages in a tax-exempt IRS status which provides for certain exemptions for the purposes of being excluded from tax for tax particular purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=786.602s">And</a> there is a specific section on 2.2 called government bond status for which the City of Medford has three delineations for which it has a requirement for which it cannot engage in this type of a for-profit private business <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=801.212s">using</a> a municipal piece of property, which would be for profit, even though some of the time would be allotted for the purposes of using the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=809.179s">It's</a> very specific in 2.2 of the section of the IRS tax exempt certificate, specifically for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=815.964s">It</a> clearly states that a non-governmental person will be treated as using proceeds of the bonds and proceeds of each issue of prior obligation of the projects in one of three areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=825.932s">One</a> uses any portion of the projects as owner, lessee, <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=829.746s">service</a> provider, operator, or manager, two, acquires the output of the projects, and four, section four, enters into any other arrangement that provided a special legal entitlement or special economic benefit to the non-governmental person. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=844.737s">That</a> would happen as what's being presented or potentially could have been presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=848.88s">And</a> accordingly, it says that the city will not enter in any contract or other arrangement after the closing date for the operation or management of any component <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=856.919s">of</a> the project by any party other than a governmental unit in which the governmental unit is the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=863.421s">The</a> city of Medford has a tax certificate. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=865.642s">It's</a> an 11 page document. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=867.443s">It</a> specifically outlines subject matters such as this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=870.924s">Spoke</a> to bond council last year, spoke to office again today, and there happens to be no re-interest in issuing this particular bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=880.587s">Also,</a> it has to have a legal review as required by the IRS on any exemption or exception. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=887.409s">And</a> I don't believe any exception has been offered to you by any legal writing or offering or request for one. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=893.713s">And</a> I would say at this point in time, uh, thank you for bringing it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=897.074s">Counsel</a> Lungo and uh, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=899.436s">Method</a> school committee for being so cooperative and transmitting that information back to the council, knowing that it was on the agenda this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=907.46s">It's</a> a shame that the communication isn't much better. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=910.242s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2291.625s">Name</a> and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2292.606s">Robert</a> M. Penta, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass, former member of this board. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2296.068s">You</a> know, one of the things that are interesting on the petition that's before the Community Development Board tomorrow night is the fact that the gentleman who was making the petition owns the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2304.313s">He</a> didn't buy the property on any contingencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2306.655s">He</a> came in there originally, because I went to the meeting in August, I believe he came in there originally looking for a five-story building. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2312.458s">Then</a> he's now downsized it to a four-story building, and he secured through the neighborhood another piece of property for which, I don't know if he bought it, it's under a P&S agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2320.279s">But</a> the fact of the matter is, it's no more than a three story allowance on that piece of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2325.624s">The</a> then Medford City Council made that discretion that three stories would be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2329.967s">And</a> if we keep breaking these rules, so to speak, without having a public hearing or a discussion as to why it should go from three to four to five, whatever it might be, then you've lost your impact, you've lost your legislative authority and your ability to understand why you need to change zoning and for what particular purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2348.807s">If</a> you let this, or if they let this go through tomorrow night, through the Community Development Board, and subsequent to that, to the Zoning Board of Appeals, what you're gonna be doing is you're technically, you're spot zoning the entire city over there, and if you allow one, come in, the past practice has already been established, and it's just gonna keep going on down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2366.578s">As</a> Cheryl just alluded to, you have the Roberts Junior School over there, the middle school, the elementary school, for kids that are going there, they're already maxed out, the parking is horrendous on any one particular day. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2377.88s">Unfortunately</a> for the developer, he probably should've sat down and thought this thing out first. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2383.004s">But</a> as it was said, this administration, as I've heard it said myself, is looking for high density because the more they bring in, it's the more money coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2391.531s">And</a> what you're doing is you're ruining the neighborhoods of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2396.135s">And</a> you just cannot continue to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2398.317s">Locust</a> Street is the perfect example. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2400.319s">The</a> council has stepped up to the plate. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2402.46s">You've</a> gotten your own attorney as well as the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2405.18s">Don't</a> let these little inconsistencies bog you down by making you feel sorry or bad for the person because he's spending the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2412.782s">If</a> a person is going to be that foolish to spend his money and buy a piece of property not knowing that the zoning is not in hand, then the problem is on his hand, not yours. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2422.604s">And</a> I really think, Mr. President, this would be the year to have a complete zoning review. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2426.825s">I</a> think it hasn't been. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2427.894s">since</a> the 70s that has taken place, I think now's the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2431.156s">You</a> couldn't have any better of examples, whether it be Locust Street, whether it be here, go on the Fellsway on the corner, I think of the Fellsway, I can't think of the name of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2440.363s">They're</a> building an apartment building where there was a two-family house. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2443.445s">It</a> just continues to go on and on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2446.007s">City's</a> not meant to be made out of bricks and stones. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2449.009s">Medford</a> is meant to be made of people living in a neighborhood that they get along, it's compatible, it reflects the zoning, <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2456.855s">And</a> it reflects the temperament of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2458.737s">It</a> doesn't reflect big business coming in, sucking up the money, and then leaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2464.103s">You</a> couldn't get a better example of that than Lumineer on Locust Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2467.667s">They</a> build 160 units. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2469.389s">He</a> was there for less than one year. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2471.071s">He</a> sold it for $160 million, and he's gone, and he's out of town. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2475.597s">And</a> that's what we're getting, people coming in, taking advantage of the property, building it up, and then leaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2481.459s">That's</a> not what Medford's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2482.98s">But</a> if that's what this administration wants, well then shame on her. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2487.261s">She</a> should understand, and she's lived in this community long enough to know that that should not be the direction of how this city goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2494.584s">Building</a> is not always better. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2496.805s">Better</a> is being smarter. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2498.705s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2502.387s">Councilor</a> Lungo-Koehn.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=5085.662s">Name</a> and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=5090.085s">Robert</a> Pantaleo, Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=5092.546s">A</a> quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=5093.847s">The</a> contract that the city of Medford has with Republic <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=5096.692s">has</a> an inclusion there on an annual basis of $250,000 is supposed to go back to this.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=5111.575s">I</a> think if you read the contract, it says it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=5123.352s">Well,</a> I would question the fact whether it's annual or not, so we won't dispute that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=5126.974s">The</a> fact of the matter is $250,000 was supposed to come back to cities and towns.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=5133.697s">But</a> what's it being used for? <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=5134.877s">It</a> can be used for the lakes, the Council of Lakes is alluding to.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=5148.923s">Councilmarks,</a> can it be recommended to Councilmarks, since it's gonna cost us money to save money, that that money come from that particular account, since his resolution, I'm assuming, is a citywide, has a citywide impact?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=5169.818s">For</a> the five business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=5172.0s">And</a> they have a right to be included in the LED approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=5175.622s">All</a> right, thank you.

the new changing of GIC insurance to cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7031.141s">Quick</a> history. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7031.702s">The</a> reason why I'm here tonight, I was edified by a union representative as it states, as this gentleman stated that on February 1st, there will be a public hearing in Boston as it relates to these new GIC changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7046.975s">And</a> he was, he was encouraging his membership, which includes city of Medford employees to go there and to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7054.081s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7054.597s">I'm</a> speaking in behalf of all City of Medford employees and retirees, as well as myself, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7062.223s">Quick</a> history, back in January 14th of 2015, before this Medford City Council, it was shown and it was presented to you that GIC, for which the City of Medford became a member on January 1st, 2012, <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7077.865s">was</a> at a deficit of approximately $160 to $190 million in deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7084.63s">And</a> that was a result of three prior years of not being funded by the state legislature to meet the needs that GIC needed to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7093.237s">That</a> presented, at that point in time, a $120 million deficit that was below the, at present then, funding level. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7101.383s">And</a> that was due to the statewide underfunding, and it was also due to the misprojected increased claims costs <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7107.881s">regarding</a> health care here in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7111.582s">So</a> what happened at that point in time some two years ago? <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7114.623s">Rates</a> increased, deductibles increased, and office visits increased. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7121.486s">When</a> the city of Medford went from bargaining from a PPO to a POS, for cities and towns required union support. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7129.408s">And</a> the union support came from the city of Medford as well when they signed that contract in August of 2011 by 14 signatories <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7138.212s">of</a> people, representatives here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7141.936s">Now</a> we have a GIC proposal that is pending before the legislature and it'll be pending before GIC. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7147.902s">Strike</a> that, it's before GIC, not the legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7150.945s">And</a> the proposal is going to make a request that a unilateral <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7156.869s">implementation</a> for an additional cost shift and plan design be proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7162.672s">We</a> here in the city of Medford are under the GIC plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7165.914s">And</a> under the GIC plan, we agreed by subscription and definition and signatory signing off in August of 2011 that we would accept whatever GIC was going to present, whether they be for the cost, whether they be for the, for whatever the costs were, <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7180.907s">that</a> people chose in their health plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7183.648s">Now,</a> if we go to this unilateral change, the question, and the question still hasn't been answered, and GIC has yet to answer it, does the unilateral change mean that the manager or the mayor of a community can unilaterally make that change, or do they need the confirmation support by the local legislative body? <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7204.012s">In</a> this case, it would be the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7206.678s">That's</a> what we had to do years ago when Mayor McGlynn accepted GIC. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7210.88s">It</a> was presented before the Medford City Council for a vote of support. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7215.861s">Now,</a> the ludicrous part about this whole thing is you're asked to vote on something, but you can't discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7221.503s">That</a> makes no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7223.464s">Absolutely</a> no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7225.185s">And</a> again, I don't know where you're going to be going, but I think those of you that aren't on GIC and have an opportunity to speak <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7232.584s">and</a> make your representation known to the employees and the retirees of the city, this is going to be huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7239.029s">And</a> the reason why it's going to be huge, because the state's use of this increase is projected at approximately 3.6%. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7247.935s">But</a> it also provides that these costs are running at large because of MassHealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7256.201s">MassHealth</a> is a $14 billion item in the state's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7260.984s">It</a> represents approximately <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7262.902s">40%</a> of the state's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7264.843s">And</a> because it represents 40% of the state budget, whatever those cost overruns have been over the past two or three years, they are now being shifted over, as in the administration and finance report the other day came out and said that everyone's going to have to bear the cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7280.648s">Well,</a> I don't think everybody should have to bear the cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7283.069s">I</a> don't think an active working employee and more importantly a retiree should have to pay for that cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7288.371s">They</a> didn't cause that cost increase to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7291.433s">I</a> think the legislature on Beacon Hill, they need to do their work and they need to get into reading what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7297.496s">They</a> need to understand that the cost of health care and drugs and prescriptions <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7304.205s">is</a> huge here. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7305.566s">We</a> are the most expensive country in the world, and we are the most expensive state in the country as a result of health care costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7313.59s">In</a> January of 2017, this month, there was a Freedman health care report that came out that so describes the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7324.128s">in</a> the position that it's in. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7325.968s">We</a> pay an awful lot for health care in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7328.789s">Yes,</a> we do have probably the best hospitals in the world, but that should have nothing to do with how we in cities and towns went out of our way six years ago to negotiate our health care costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7340.772s">As</a> of January of this year, according to the contract and the memorandum of understanding between the city of Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7346.74s">its</a> retirees and its active employees, as of January this year, we have until January to October 1st to make a definite decision whether we stay in the GIC plan or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7360.31s">And</a> if we don't stay in that plan for GIC, we have between October 1st and June 30th of 2018 to make that final decision where we go, whether we go back to competitive bidding, other insurance companies come in and what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7376.282s">The</a> contract that Mayor McGlynn signed brings us to 2018, that's six and a half years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7381.644s">The</a> city of Medford was told we would be saving over that six and a half year period of time approximately 25 plus million dollars in health care costs and the rates that were set by GIC would be the rates that would be set for those people who are members of GIC. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7398.746s">This</a> change to go to a unilateral decision, if GIC were to accept it, and the city of Medford were to engage in a unilateral decision, could have an absolute financial devastating effect on retirees and active employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7414.595s">That's</a> not what it was meant to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7416.656s">This</a> proposal, unilaterally, is going to shift the cost <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7422.457s">to</a> GIC employees, because if GIC employees go to a unilateral determination, those people who don't have GIC, as compared to those that do, will bear the additional cost as it relates to making the bill be paid here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7441.573s">The</a> other part we should take into consideration is the question, how do we get this question answered? <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7451.413s">You</a> folks, those of you that are out there right now, that are not sitting here, but are members of GIC, I think you need to ask the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7460.846s">because</a> it's not expressing a financial interest, it's expressing a need to know whether in fact the city of Medford is going to continue on with GIC. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7469.59s">And</a> if the city of Medford is not going to continue on with GIC, you as a legislative body, I'm assuming we'll have to make that decision by choice of change. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7479.494s">And</a> the mayor should be making this type of representation before you, this type of consideration before you as to where and what effect it's going to have here within your budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7490.998s">Let's</a> see. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7495.001s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7496.022s">This</a> brings us to the matter of how do we pursue section 13, 14, and 15 and the memorandum of agreement between the city of Medford and its retirees and <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7514.736s">and</a> it's retirees and everyday workers, regular workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7518.697s">These</a> action alerts coming from the Commonwealth of Mass, coming from the Office of Administration and Finance, participating municipalities such as we, and the memorandum of understanding that we have over here, it's very important, it's very important to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7532.36s">And</a> it's very important to understand that by June 30th of 2018, you folks are gonna have to know where you're gonna go. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7540.022s">But</a> it's the retirees, <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7542.332s">who</a> are the important component of all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7544.393s">Because</a> they should not have the shifted burden of having the increase in cost for medical services through the insurance company for which they are represented by people who negotiate here with the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7557.959s">You</a> know, we talk about a lot of things around here. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7561.384s">But</a> this is equally as important as maybe to zoning, because we're talking about our municipal employees, we're talking about our school department employees, we're talking about union and non-union members, because they all come under this insurance situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7574.748s">But</a> when you think about the increase in cost, your cost in your food, your cost in your taxes that just went up, your water and sewer rates that have just gone up, you have a Community Preservation Act tax that went up, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7587.631s">All</a> types of insurances that have gone up. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7590.192s">And</a> most recently, since January 11, you have people concerned over whether their employment as it relates to vacation time was going to be an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7600.382s">That's</a> gone back and forth as to what it's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7603.926s">It's</a> making it harder and harder for our municipal employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7607.069s">They</a> don't make an awful lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7608.591s">They</a> work for their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7609.552s">They're</a> good employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7611.173s">99%</a> of them are good employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7613.207s">But</a> they have a right to know where they're going and to shop around, if need be the case, to pick out a health care provider. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7619.349s">But</a> the city owes it to every single municipal employee and retiree to let them know whether they're going to be on board or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7625.751s">So</a> Mr. President, through you, I would respectfully ask that, since you're not a member of JIC, that I would respectfully ask that you ask of the president administration, however the answer needs to come in, <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7637.696s">whether</a> the unilateral proposal, if approved by GIC, empowers the mayor of this community to make independent decisions, that for which GIC, for which we are presently under, would not, I mean, that's the whole issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7653.439s">February</a> 1st, there's a huge hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7656.1s">They're</a> asking many, many people to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7658.501s">Last</a> time when this issue became a fact, 80,000 emails, 80,000 emails were sent to GIC. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7665.374s">And</a> unfortunately, they didn't listen to them and they didn't adhere to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7668.635s">But</a> I would hope in this situation... Excuse me, Council Member.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7675.838s">At</a> this particular time, Mr. President, this is an important issue, but this is an issue to talk about now, well in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7681.86s">As</a> the memorandum of understanding indicates, it indicates here as of January, <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7686.583s">I</a> believe January of this year, 2017, between January and October 17th, the city has to make its decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7693.945s">They</a> should be talking right now with the bargaining units of all 14 signatories that signed up on this memorandum of understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7701.387s">So</a> I would hope, Mr. President, that when February 1st comes at 1230 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7707.089s">at</a> 19 Standover Street in Boston, we can get as many people as we can there to tell them we do not want to go to this unilateral <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7713.715s">this</a> unilateral allowance because that's going to basically cost shift, cost shift, whatever the deficit is running in mass health as part of it over to the GIC people. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7725.019s">They</a> didn't cause it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7726.54s">They're</a> willing to pay their fair share, but it's going up and it's, and it's just not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7731.642s">And</a> it's just not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7733.322s">And</a> just as a side note, and I don't mean to be humorous, but Christmas is over, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7740.665s">It</a> is. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7741.173s">Is</a> there any reason why the Christmas lights are still up on the building outside? <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7744.074s">I</a> do not have that answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7747.114s">That's</a> not the main to the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7749.235s">I</a> understand that, but we got to move on unless they're up early for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7753.495s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7753.956s">Maybe.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7754.356s">But</a> the question is simply this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7757.056s">I</a> would hope you folks and through the chair, Mr. President, you get that answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7760.417s">That's</a> an important answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7761.697s">And</a> if you can get it before February 1st, it would be great because somebody has to have that answer as it relates to <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7767.038s">your,</a> well, it's not yours. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7768.118s">You're</a> on your private one, you know, but those who are retirees, those who are employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7771.98s">And</a> I want to thank that union representative who put that out there on Facebook, who made the request. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7776.621s">Cause</a> that's what got me on this particular kick to go forward and make this presentation.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7781.603s">You're</a> welcome.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7986.746s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7988.507s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7989.287s">Name</a> and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7990.448s">Bob</a> Pinter again, Zero Summit Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7992.229s">A</a> quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7993.07s">He</a> just jogged my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7994.271s">I</a> asked you, and hopefully through your chair, you will ask that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7997.073s">The</a> second part of the question should have been as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7999.294s">If,</a> in fact, we go to this unilateral, if GIC goes to unilaterally, does that mean the local legislative body <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8005.503s">has</a> to make an approval on what the mayor, the executive officer would do. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8009.085s">Cause</a> that's going to be extremely important. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8010.846s">That</a> was the requirement back in 2011 when we accepted it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8014.289s">But</a> now the six and a half year contract is going to be over. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8017.33s">Nobody</a> knows what that language is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8019.332s">So</a> I think it would be incumbent, hopefully upon you, Mr. President, to ask both of those questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8023.854s">If</a> GIC goes to a unilateral program and if the city of Medford were to go in that direction, does the mayor unilaterally do it or does she need support? <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8032.962s">from</a> all 14 union people for approval before the council.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8051.451s">So</a> could you ask that question? <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8052.612s">Could</a> somebody put that question forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8055.213s">The</a> question is if the city, if GIC adopts the unilateral program, <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8060.547s">does</a> that mean the chief executive officer of a city be in this case of mayor? <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8064.788s">Can</a> she independently make changes which could possibly be cost shift changes to retirees as well as employees if the city opts out to go to a different union type of a different healthcare provider? <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8080.433s">Hopefully</a> we'll have all that information for you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8374.71s">Wait</a> a minute, I asked for a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8377.623s">It</a> should be placed on file, because that's the problem around here. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8380.344s">Just</a> take everything and place it on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8382.145s">There</a> was a motion to ask, and you said you were going to pursue it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8416.39s">Well,</a> you were asked to make a motion.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8419.811s">Yes,</a> you can. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8420.291s">You're</a> not the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8421.032s">You're</a> not allowed to make a motion.<h2><a href="../2017-01-13_HLZVJwxP68w/2017-01-13_HLZVJwxP68w.html">Medford, MA City Council - Jan. 10, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=694.83s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=696.137s">Name</a> and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=697.078s">My</a> name, my name is Robert Penter, zero summit road method, Massachusetts, former member of this board. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=702.701s">Um,</a> I have no question about remediate, uh, remediating the land, but there are some issues here that haven't been resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=709.265s">And</a> two of them in particular were brought up at the December meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=712.286s">Um,</a> where's the law that allows for this number one and where was, and where's the public hearing on a March 14th of 2014 in a meeting that took place with the Medford office of environmental affairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=726.607s">There</a> were a host of folks that were there, including myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=729.848s">And</a> in there, there was an EPA rules and regulation that basically states the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=734.349s">EPA</a> regulation states that there will be a public meeting that will be advertised through the standard public meeting notification channels. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=745.171s">And</a> that was in reference to the fact that just what you asked about, Mr. President, and for the public, there is yet to be a public hearing meeting regarding this amount of money of $900,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=756.777s">for</a> this particular transfer. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=758.937s">It</a> was stated and quoted at the last meeting, there would be anywheres from between 75 to 100 injection points that would be placed into the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=766.959s">Brown</a> and Caldwell, who we spent well over $100,000, indicated that that would take two drilling rigs in no more than 10 to 15 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=776.481s">You</a> were told this past December it would take approximately a month of disruption. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=781.122s">That</a> goes to your point, Councilman Longs. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=783.822s">Also,</a> the soil depth of 20 to 25 feet, <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=787.573s">which</a> is found on the GZA report, indicates that their cost, their estimation, and they were the people that reviewed the Brown and Caulfield, their cost was between $2.4 to $2.9 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=801.879s">Brown</a> and Caulfield said it would cost the city approximately $1.8 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=806.381s">And</a> you're looking at $900,000 that's now being presented before you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=810.643s">So</a> these are issues that I think that still needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=815.125s">And</a> also, <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=817.273s">The</a> city of Medford had a projected analysis that took place in August, July of 2015, for which I have here. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=824.318s">It</a> talks about the cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=825.419s">It</a> talks about the remediation. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=828.121s">Now,</a> I spoke to the Bureau of Accounts at the Department of Revenue, and they have a rule and regulation that is very specific as it relates to what you can and cannot do as it relates to this particular thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=840.19s">It's</a> guideline 08-101. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=843.632s">And</a> it says, for what services can a community adopt an enterprise fund? <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=847.874s">It</a> goes into all the issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=849.814s">Yes,</a> no, we're different. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=850.935s">But</a> then it says the community may not, may not establish enterprise funds for normal government operations or services, such as public safety, inspectional services, or cemeteries. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=865.458s">We're</a> talking about something here that's remediation of land, dirty soil, before you even get down to 20 to 25 feet of wherever that water might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=876.401s">You</a> cannot. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=878.297s">and</a> I defy anyone here to show me a case or an authorization where enterprise funds money, water and sewer enterprise funds money were used to remediate dirty soil that's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=890.981s">You</a> were there right from the beginning, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=893.162s">You</a> heard the commentary. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=894.943s">You</a> saw the businesses that have been affected. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=897.884s">If</a> you go forward with this vote tonight without having a legal determination that it can be done, and also without contacting the Department of Revenue, Division of Local Services, <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=907.642s">and</a> explain to them this is the reason why you want to spend your $900,000 out of an enterprise fund for which they can give you an opinion whether you can or cannot do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=916.968s">And</a> we had this conversation in December. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=919.03s">I'm</a> a little bit shocked that both of these young ladies that work for the mayor haven't brought any of that information forward that would justify. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=925.915s">So</a> all that seems to take place that took place in December and now, nothing has changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=930.458s">It's</a> just sat on the table, and whatever packet of information you got, <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=934.176s">over</a> the weekend, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=936.117s">But</a> you have a legal quandary here. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=937.658s">And</a> you're talking about the taxpayers' money. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=939.879s">You're</a> talking about approximately $8 million that's in free cash that could be used for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=944.622s">And</a> as the law so states, unless there's something on the boards, on the boards within 90 days for water and sewer street reconstruction, that money has to go back to the ratepayers because it's a surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=956.009s">That's</a> a surplus that the ratepayers have been overcharged with. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=960.051s">The</a> intent of the project sounds good. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=962.365s">cleaning</a> up the property and moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=964.446s">But</a> there's a process that needs to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=967.027s">And</a> I would strongly suggest to you, since you don't have any legal determination, nothing from the Department of Revenue, a Bureau of Accounts standard that's operational each and every day for all cities and towns as it relates to enterprise funds, I would suggest that you, instead of take the money out of the enterprise fund, you take it out of your free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=987.416s">Or</a> before you even go one step further, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=991.241s">To</a> say that, you know, it's, it's three years overdue and now we're going to get an extension. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=996.663s">Whose</a> fault is it for three years overdue? <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=998.444s">I</a> think the council has been asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1000.304s">I</a> know when I was on here, I went to all those meetings and there was supposed to be updated meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1004.886s">You</a> haven't had the public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1006.827s">That's</a> an EPA regulation and rule requirement for the community as a whole, for the businesses, so they can understand what's going on and to get some input. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1016.911s">Where's</a> the input from the community? <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1018.912s">Where's</a> the public hearing? <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1020.837s">And</a> why, at this point in time, would you even want to take a chance in having the State Department of Revenue question you when it comes to do your annual assessment on money and budget projections coming back to the city of Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1033.54s">I</a> say this with all due respect to the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1035.66s">Sounds</a> good that people are going to say, well, all of a sudden we're going to get the land, we're going to get the West Medford parking lot, and the brownfields remediated for $900,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1044.022s">You</a> have two figures from two outside concerns, $1.9 million on one, <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1049.763s">anywhere</a> from 2.2 to 2.5, 2.6 on another. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1054.685s">So</a> I think somebody needs to explain to you the difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1057.847s">I've</a> got everything right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1058.888s">I'd</a> be more than happy to spend hours with you to explain and tell you what the differences are. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1063.69s">But</a> I think that's your job right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1065.951s">And</a> your job is to make sure that you make an intelligent decision, not a decision that's been hanging around since December. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1071.534s">And</a> you still, you still don't have the appropriate information to make this vote this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1077.557s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3784.735s">Name</a> and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3785.836s">Uh,</a> Robert Pinto, zero summit road method, mass from a member of the sport. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3789.754s">The</a> part that I think should be established before this board, you folks are the only ones that can actually change a bus stop for whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3799.856s">For</a> the MBTA to turn around and change the bus stop arbitrarily for whatever their reasons allegedly are, I don't think you can do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3806.318s">I</a> think one of the problems you're going to have is the fact that they're going to tell you they don't come out to nighttime meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3811.439s">They're</a> not getting paid to do that anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3813.479s">You</a> know, you're talking about a public safety issue, but you're also talking about an issue <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3817.51s">where</a> you have a bridge here in Medford Square, and they're allegedly only halfway through a year and a half into the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3822.371s">For</a> the last three weeks, they've had nobody working there. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3824.711s">And</a> by having nobody working there, they've completely or could have helped out a couple of the businesses on that right-hand side of the street, but instead they just left the place a total mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3834.233s">So</a> it's just a shame to think that the state can grant out these contracts to these contractors that'll probably be running two or three jobs at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3843.805s">to</a> the demise of the Medford taxpayer and the Medford taxpaying business person here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3850.389s">My</a> suggestion would be that not only you get your state delegation and your state senator, I mean, they're the ones that control the purse strings for the Department of Transportation and for the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3859.873s">And</a> there is no reason for something like this to happen without you folks being notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3864.376s">And</a> by doing that, hopefully, by bringing, I would suggest that you have a meeting right here before the Medford City Council and have it discussed in the open unless anyone who has a concern about it, they should be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3876.626s">And</a> the people that really should be behind all of this is the Chamber of Commerce. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3881.009s">It's</a> their business that's being affected. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3883.691s">And</a> if their business is getting affected, it's also, <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3886.535s">the</a> people who patronize those businesses in the area of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3890.679s">So</a> for the MBTA to make their decision without consulting with you, I think they have it in the opposite way. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3896.043s">And</a> I think, I think it's upon you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3898.005s">It's</a> your responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3899.426s">Like</a> it was mine when I was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3900.988s">You</a> guys are vested with the fact you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3902.869s">Nothing</a> is grandfathered in. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3904.411s">I</a> think you should just need to take the bull by the horns. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3906.352s">And</a> if in fact, if in fact they don't want to come at a nighttime meeting, I would suggest that you send a certified letter to Charlie Baker, the governor of this Commonwealth and just tell him, <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3914.086s">that</a> you're not doing the right thing by your department heads by saying that they refuse to come to a nighttime meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3919.407s">This</a> is not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3920.188s">It's</a> not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3921.148s">And</a> it doesn't make sense for public safety and for the bus stop locations.<h2><a href="../2017-01-08_Yqa0Po2dZcA/2017-01-08_Yqa0Po2dZcA.html">Medford, MA City Council - Jan. 3, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3702.073s">Good</a> evening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3703.153s">Congratulations</a> on your term. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3705.243s">My</a> name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, former member of the Saugus Party. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3709.705s">On</a> the issue of branding, I'll get to that first. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3711.926s">Alan,</a> maybe just an idea that you can call it the Lawrence Memorial Hospital slash the division of the Welfare, Welforce Group, because I think the community would respect the idea that the merger is taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3722.53s">It's</a> a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3723.451s">It's</a> a great place to have an opportunity to move forward, but at the same time, this community knows the hospital is the Lawrence Memorial Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3729.885s">And</a> as a division of welfare, that might be the catalyst to get other communities to be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3734.989s">But</a> my concern is, you folks have all mentioned it, but there's a debt obligation to the Malden Hospital, to the Lawrence Memorial Hospital, or Hallmark has. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3743.635s">And</a> there hasn't been any comment as it relates to the fact is how does that debt obligation work when the three hospitals get together and I don't just know if it's a third, I don't know how it's going to be proportioned out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3755.035s">at</a> who has the majority vote and how the vote's going to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3758.296s">But</a> whatever the multi-million dollars that are left on that hospital debt obligation that's needed, how is that going to interact, number one? <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3764.899s">And</a> number two, when something needs to take place as far as development, for which all of you folks have talked about the development, who's going to come first in line for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3773.123s">I</a> mean, if two hospitals have the same idea, is wellness going to allow both hospitals to do the same thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3779.045s">Are</a> you going to split up the types of developments that you're going to have? <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3782.847s">And</a> I think that would be beneficial for <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3785.358s">A,</a> the community to know, but also the doctors, the nurses and the programs that you're going to be having here at the, uh, at the Lawrence. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3792.561s">Um,</a> so with that being said, and I know it's a financial consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3797.323s">The</a> last part of the question would be on an annual basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3800.404s">I'm</a> quite sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3801.725s">Is</a> this merger independent or is it conclusive of all together? <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3806.106s">And</a> the profits are split three ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3808.387s">And</a> then the Lawrence can go on its merry way and take whatever that money is for whatever its purpose is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3813.467s">I'm</a> assuming, and they would assume, cause you said, um, Mr. McDonald, you said we will be responsible for our own obligations and that's an outstanding obligation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3823.032s">So</a> I think we need to have, I'd like to have that question answered as a taxpayer in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3827.995s">Um,</a> I think it's great that the merger is taking place, but I still think these are a couple of questions that need to be answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3834.259s">And</a> I, and I think it would be good for the community to know where we're going because I know it was council Falco has and council Longo current and some members of the council have attended meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3842.576s">as</a> to what's going to be the development of the Malden Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3845.498s">Once</a> that sale takes place, does that money go into the pot of the kitty or does that go just strictly to the Lawrence Memorial Hospital? <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3852.164s">So</a> I would appreciate it through the chair, Mr. President, if Mr. McDonald could answer those questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3857.188s">Alan,</a> can you answer Councilor Penter's concerns?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7757.785s">Um,</a> well, it sounds like it's a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7761.627s">I</a> mean, for the city to go out of its way to get this grant, to put a piece of parkland in a position where you could probably do something else. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7769.73s">I</a> just don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7770.935s">You</a> know, the part that seems to be very disturbing, they can go out of their way to find money, whether it be for this park land. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7776.636s">And</a> this past week, an application went in for the Medford Public Library, which is all good. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7780.597s">These</a> are all good causes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7782.058s">But</a> you have a Medford police station that's completely coming apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7785.979s">It's</a> lost its value. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7787.139s">You</a> go back to 2009, Councilman Marks brought forward a complaint from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts saying that the building was unfit for its habitation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7794.961s">The</a> city did nothing on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7796.041s">The</a> city refused to condemn it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7797.681s">And</a> it's in a state of disrepair. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7799.522s">There</a> is nothing going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7801.245s">And</a> you try to explain this to the people in the city of Medford, you're spending $250,000, almost $500,000 to rehabilitate a place in Medford Square that you would have to leave like that ad infinitum. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7812.737s">It</a> just doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7813.958s">It</a> doesn't relate to not only development of Medford Square, it just doesn't relate to spending your money in the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7821.446s">There</a> are so many things that need to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7824.372s">And</a> I just don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7825.132s">And</a> I think today, most recently, the administration just hired another assistant in one of the departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7831.193s">You</a> know, it would be nice if you folks and ladies, you know, were advised as to what's going on when the hiring takes place here and to have some kind of an opportunity to really need all these people at these expensive salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7842.636s">You</a> know, you just got through, unfortunately, insulting the kids from the vocational school, not you as a Councilor, but the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7848.985s">by</a> trying to hide and not use the Christmas gifts of building these things that they had around here for City Hall, and then you go put them down at Hormel Stadium, and the city administration says we're gonna have another dedicating ceremony for which never took place for that, but you're standing here, but you're standing here as it relates to spending $250,000 and accepting a grant that you'll have no control over the use of the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7872.497s">It</a> makes absolutely no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7874.238s">So</a> I agree with you, Councilman Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7876.159s">It</a> was your idea in the beginning just to refurbish it, <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7878.952s">But</a> for that kind of money, try to explain that to the guy in the street who's trying to save money to buy a new refrigerator or a washing machine and do some upgrading in his house.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7888.058s">The</a> city should change its priorities as it relates to how they want to spend their development money and for its future.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8416.056s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8417.678s">Just</a> one point. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8418.278s">Maybe</a> I misunderstood something. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8420.338s">Did</a> you just say that this is the beginning of the starting of the building of the square? <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8424.2s">It's</a> a starting point. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8425.441s">Where's</a> the report on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8426.521s">And</a> who presented that? <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8427.542s">And</a> where is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8429.263s">It's</a> no one presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8429.983s">It's</a> a starting point. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8431.184s">Who</a> said it's the starting point? <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8432.184s">I</a> said it's the starting point. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8433.985s">So</a> don't let's mislead the people by saying it's the starting point.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8440.428s">The</a> starting point of the building in the square is those poor businesses that are being affected by a bridge that's got another year and a half to go over there, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8447.631s">And</a> they can't get the right of day. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8448.972s">And</a> no one from this city, hall, has gone down to any one of those businesses and asked them, how is their business, how has it been affected? <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8455.194s">They</a> have a bus stop issue they can't even get resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8457.696s">And</a> you're talking about taking $250,000 and putting it on a piece of property.

put our political principles aside, and we do unify amongst ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3219.097s">This</a> gentleman, 28 years old, was hit by a bomb, pipe bomb, four days after the incident that took place at the Boston Marathon. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3227.96s">He</a> was one of the first officers on the scene. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3230.461s">And</a> as a result of that, he received a head injury. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3233.022s">And</a> he died subsequently one year later. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3235.543s">And</a> as a result of that, <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3237.553s">His</a> mother, Roxanne Simons, and father, who lived down in the Cape, were never notified of this story called Patriots Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3245.916s">They</a> called up the producers, Peter Berg, Mark Wahlberg, and they have yet to receive a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3252.339s">Fellow</a> Boston police officers are aware of what took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3257.901s">A</a> state representative up on Beacon Hill named Tim Whelan <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3262.032s">made</a> an application to the, um, the board of the directors and the film director, uh, for, uh, Patriot's day and asked them if they would consider doing a post script somehow of putting it in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3274.455s">Never</a> got a response back. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3276.675s">The</a> part that was hurting and disturbing according to Mrs. Simons is the fact that when they can't at the end of the movie, the postscripts of the movie had the four pitches and the four names of the folks that we have in our peace garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3288.998s">But</a> Mr. Simon's name was, was not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3291.722s">This</a> gentleman is 28 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3293.422s">He's</a> a college graduate. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3295.143s">And</a> subsequently, on graduating college, he went to the Boston Police School to become a Boston police officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3300.424s">He</a> was originally stationed in Brighton, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3302.904s">But</a> he was more of wanting to be not a Boston police officer who hands out tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3307.145s">He</a> wanted to get into the inner city youth, and that's where he did. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3310.546s">He</a> went into the inner city youth where the problems were, and he loved it. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3314.467s">He</a> was a good police officer, loved by many policemen, and loved by his community. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3320.534s">He</a> unfortunately has not even received any kind of recognition throughout this whole program called Patriot's Day, which is a great movie if you want to look at it like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3329.561s">And</a> as they do say, sometimes there are some errors and there's some slips to get through. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3334.365s">But</a> they were notified well in advance, and they're still notified as of now, that maybe to have him recognized as being an unsung hero who died, unfortunately, one year after the tragedy. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3345.573s">He</a> was one of the first people, one of the first people <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3348.175s">of</a> Boston police responders to Watertown Mass on the night of that incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3353.017s">Mr.</a> President, all my council colleagues, you folks do many resolutions for many people, whether they are for sports, whether they are for someone who might have passed away, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3365.083s">But</a> for the family of this police officer, I think it would be outstanding that this Medford City Council recognizes the fact that this gentleman, DJ Simons, <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3375.402s">who</a> didn't get recognized, is recognized by the city of Medford, its city government. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3381.123s">For</a> the gentleman did give his life. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3382.924s">He</a> did respond and he was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3386.125s">And</a> for his parents not to have any recognition to that at all, it's just not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3390.966s">And</a> I don't think it's fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3392.706s">So</a> I ask of you, seven of you collectively, for one of you to offer the resolution, or if jointly, to send a note of condolences and of appreciation and of thanks to the Simons family, thanking them for their sons. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3405.776s">efforts</a> as a result of the Boston Marathon. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3409.018s">And</a> maybe there is something, somehow, some way, a plaque of postscript can find its way to that Peace Garden as well here in the city of Medford to let the entire world, to let the entire people know and to let the Simons family know that the city of Medford will not forget and they're most appreciative of what their son did. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3428.033s">So</a> I offer, I ask one of you to come forward and do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3431.815s">Mayor</a> Marty Walsh of Boston, as of today's paper, <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3435.683s">has</a> he himself has taken it upon himself to seek out through the producers and the directors of that show who have refused, I shouldn't say refused, who have yet to respond back to him to have him included. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3447.709s">What</a> the reason is, nobody knows. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3450.29s">But</a> it's a known fact, it is a known fact that that gentleman died in the line of duty protecting the citizens, doing his job as a police officer in behalf of the citizens of this commonwealth and the citizens of Boston and for the people who participated in that Boston Marathon.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5710.491s">My</a> name is Robert Penter. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5711.471s">I</a> live at zero summit Road method mass at the outset I'd like to congratulate councillor Caraviello and coming the incoming president for next year and councillor marks I believe you the incoming vice president <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5722.397s">I</a> have some concerns over this subject matter, because having served on the city council, I've been a part of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5728.499s">And</a> some of my concerns reflect upon the following issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5731.62s">Number</a> one, when we talk about the $900,000 that you folks are being asked to appropriate here tonight, first $200,000 supposedly is coming from the remaining amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5740.983s">There</a> is nothing in here that talks about change orders or this being a fixed fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5745.865s">So</a> you really don't have anything in front of you that tells you that this is going to be a definitive number, because this number could escalate. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5752.627s">if,</a> in fact, things were to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5755.428s">And</a> if, in fact, this is a $900,000 project, why are you folks paying for it up front at 100%? <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5761.149s">If</a> this is going to be a two-, three-year project, why wouldn't you be paying for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5764.829s">Why</a> wouldn't the city be proposing to make a payment over a three-year period of time? <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5769.41s">That</a> way there, according to the engineer, she's not guaranteeing anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5773.211s">But</a> the fact of the matter is, if this thing doesn't work out, at least you have some leverage to go back to make sure that they do what they're supposed to do, or something needs to be changed to correct the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5782.546s">That'll</a> take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5784.147s">And</a> also taking into consideration this is an excessive $1 million project, there doesn't seem to be any bond performance that seems to be being presented here, protecting the city's asset, which is its cash, which is that of the Medford public taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5799.117s">So</a> you're looking at a cost factor. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5801.599s">You</a> don't have anything in front of you that tells you that a bond performance is going to be had here. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5806.122s">There's</a> nothing telling you as to why you're paying it up front rather than over an extended period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5811.78s">That,</a> to me, would present a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5815.082s">Also,</a> I don't know if there was an enviro-forensic analysis that took place relative to the composition of what the problem is in the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5827.608s">These</a> are specialist people who come in, and I'm quite sure that our city engineer is aware of these type of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5832.833s">They're</a> experts, and they can tell you that what and if the city is using is the right treatment to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5838.577s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5839.638s">The</a> last time I know of a public hearing on this matter, because I attended it, was in August of 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5845.043s">And</a> in that report that took place and presented in August of 2015, a public hearing was supposed to take place before this Medford City Council <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5855.908s">and</a> for the people of Medford and for the people affected in the West Medford area to come forward to listen to what's being presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5864.093s">You</a> are being presented the lowest of the numbers as compared to the highest of the numbers to resolve this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5870.617s">And</a> I think you're aware of this, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5872.558s">I</a> think you're aware of the fact, because you were there with me at the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5875.359s">This</a> 900,000 figure is the lowest of whatever it's going to cost to remediate this particular project. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5881.463s">The</a> city of Medford and the taxpayers <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5883.236s">And</a> those business owners, as Councilman Max has alluded to, deserve more and deserve better. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5887.258s">To</a> wait almost three years and hold your property up for almost three years cancels out any idea of the fact that the property can be sold and somebody would have to come in and deal with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5898.104s">And</a> if you're going to go out for a bid, maybe the bid should go out and be inclusive of the fact that if somebody's going to come in and make a bid, <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5904.928s">to</a> do this project, maybe the bid should include somebody wanting to buy the product, buy this particular subject matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5911.997s">And</a> maybe that person who buys it will have to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5915.341s">Therefore,</a> if we are going to go out of our way to pay to remediate this piece of property, <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5920.996s">And</a> then once it's remediated, and if it's corrected properly, the business owners then go out and sell the property at a much higher rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5928.459s">Who</a> loses out on that particular deal? <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5930.52s">And</a> that particular deal, the city loses out. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5932.881s">So</a> I think your options need to be put both ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5935.502s">Maybe</a> somebody coming in who wants to buy the property, or somebody coming in to remediate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5940.044s">Let's</a> just see what's out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5941.504s">Who's</a> offering whatever needs to be offered? <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5943.705s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5945.026s">You</a> also talked about the fact that you want to take this money <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5951.588s">And</a> you want to take it from the Water Enterprise Retained Earnings Account. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5956.192s">Now,</a> we all know that the enterprise account here in the city of Medford dates back to 1983, 1984, when the city of Medford first entertained it. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5964.219s">And</a> we know that the city of Medford's enterprise fund, its enterprise fund, is one that's considered, for its best practice, and for this fund, it's for water, sewer, and stormwater systems, period. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5978.271s">The</a> law is very specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5980.312s">when</a> it turns around and tells you what it cannot be used for. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5984.115s">The</a> community may not establish enterprise funds for normal government operations or services such as public safety, inspectional services, or cemeteries. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5995.005s">This</a> is a public safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5996.866s">This</a> public safety issue wraps itself around an environmental issue and maybe a public health issue, but it's a public safety issue first. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6003.822s">This</a> has got nothing to do with your infrastructure of water, stormwater, or infrastructure for any of these pipes that are going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6012.368s">The</a> City of Medford presently sits on over, I believe, close to $9 million in your free cash account. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6018.313s">If</a> the City of Medford wants to go forward and pay for this without disturbing that process of profit that you have almost $8.5 million in your water and sewer account, <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6027.092s">You</a> have nothing presented before you tonight that talks about any kind of major infrastructure in this community, nothing more than fixing a parking lot that's been there for many, many years that the city's had control over. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6039.997s">I</a> think you're doing a disservice not only to yourselves, but to the enterprise fund account, because that money is there for a specific purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6048.84s">Plus</a> the fact enterprise account, on an annual basis, <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6052.148s">The</a> accounting needs to come forward as to tell you what they're going to spend their money on. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6056.691s">And</a> now you're getting a hit for $900,000 right now that was not put in any part of the budget, no public hearing has taken place, and the city administration wants you to go forward and spend this money on something that's going to take almost a three-year process, and you're paying up front. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6074.353s">something</a> that's not even going to be guaranteed by any kind of a bond performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6078.054s">What</a> if the contractor goes bust, goes, becomes bankrupt? <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6082.356s">Where</a> does the city go then? <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6084.357s">You</a> know, you've got to protect your assets here and the assets is the taxpayer's money for what needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6092.3s">More</a> importantly, you know, when you sit here and you think about all the things you talk about on a daily basis, you know, things that you might, you may want to call this environmental. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6101.403s">You</a> may want to call it public health. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6102.543s">You</a> may want to call it public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6104.599s">But</a> you're taking money from an account that it shouldn't be coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6108.58s">Unless</a> somebody can come up before this podium and explain to you that Medford's Water and Sewer account, its Water and Sewer Enterprise account, can legally transfer this money, for which the law under Chapter 44, Section 58, F and a half, and 44, Section 38 and 43 says that you can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6129.924s">And</a> the Department of Revenue also says that you can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6134.069s">under</a> the Bureau accounts under the guideline release of 08-101. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6139.071s">You</a> cannot transfer this money.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6148.674s">You</a> know, when we had this discussion a few years ago and then keep bringing it forward and we're going forward and we're bringing it forward for the next three years or whatever it might be, there's no guarantee here. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6157.557s">There's</a> no guarantee here that this is going to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6159.558s">And</a> I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6160.32s">with</a> the city engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6161.12s">Nothing's</a> guaranteed in life. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6162.381s">Maybe</a> the only thing that's guaranteed is we're all going to die someday. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6165.361s">But</a> while we're alive and while we're elected to do the people's business, maybe we should look at all our options that we need to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6172.403s">You</a> need to have that public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6174.183s">You</a> need to present it before the city, the people of the city, to the public, to the taxpayers over here, and to yourselves as to know what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6181.405s">You</a> need to know all your financial options and how we're getting to them and how you are getting to them tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6186.266s">Right</a> now, you've got $900,000 being asked to transfer. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6189.855s">I</a> would respectfully state that I would put that on hold. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6192.517s">I</a> would request if you want to take it out of free cash, if in fact it's that important. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6197.66s">But</a> I really think you need to have that public hearing and to hear all the comments from all the people and to understand what the valuation is. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6203.725s">And</a> you need your city assessor down here because you're going to take the evaluations of the property today, right now, which can't be sold. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6209.929s">Some</a> of them can't be sold. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6211.73s">And</a> as it's going to be in three years, if in fact it is remediated, whether it can be sold, <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6216.152s">So</a> that means the city of Medford is going to spend in excess of a million dollars, if not more, to make somebody else's property beneficial to be sold. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6223.86s">True,</a> they did not cause the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6226.342s">But</a> we need to look. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6227.123s">You're</a> looking at the short term. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6228.364s">I'm</a> looking at the long term. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6229.465s">And</a> the long term tells me you need to have more of a discussion on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6232.808s">This</a> has been hanging around for a long period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6235.991s">I</a> think you need another committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6237.552s">You</a> definitely need that public hearing because that was part and parcel of the $100,000 cost that the city paid to have an outside consultant come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6246.756s">And</a> if you remember correctly, they also paid $5,000 for another company to come in to check over the $100,000 consultant's report. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6254.539s">So</a> you really need to take a look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6256.72s">And</a> you really need to understand that you're buying the lowest of whatever was proposed to remediate the problem, hoping that it would resolve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6269.885s">Nice</a> to meet you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6464.202s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6469.673s">Quick</a> correction here, I want to make my point clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6473.776s">The</a> Department of Revenue through its Bureau of Accounts indicates that every community with an enterprise fund establish a written internal policy regarding indirect cost allocations and should review this policy annually. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6487.124s">That's</a> an annually written report. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6489.365s">This</a> is an indirect cost to the normal water and sewer account. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6494.788s">And</a> if in fact the new city auditor indicated that it's legal <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6499.419s">Show</a> me a case. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6500.3s">Show</a> us a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6501.121s">Strike</a> that. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6502.302s">Show</a> you folks a case and a city where this has taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6506.486s">This</a> is not within the guidelines as provided under the Massachusetts General Laws, and it's not provided in the Department of Revenue Bureau of Accounts guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6515.774s">Now,</a> if she can produce a case that says that you can take that money from there, that's all well and good. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6520.299s">As</a> I said, I've yet to find it. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6521.9s">It's</a> yet to be proven to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6523.422s">But</a> I think it needs to be proven to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6525.34s">Because</a> $900,000 is a lot of money to take out of a surplus account. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6529.143s">And</a> if you take that money out of your water and sewer account, the better question is, why are you sitting on $8.5 million when people throughout this whole community talk about water pressure problems up in the heights? <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6540.131s">They</a> talk about groundwater problems in certain parts. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6543.974s">You</a> have storm drains that can't hold water. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6546.817s">These</a> are the projects you should be talking about if you want to talk about water and sewer account. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6550.96s">And</a> this dollar amount was never mentioned anywhere in the accounting. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6555.404s">of</a> this new proposal that's being before you here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6559.607s">Sounds</a> great if you want to rectify it, but financing is another thing and you have the money in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6565.652s">So</a> why would you want to disturb an account that's there for a particular purpose? <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6570.035s">I</a> respectfully disagree with the new director because she doesn't produce anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6574.478s">She's</a> just saying it's legal. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6576.179s">Well,</a> if it's legal, they wouldn't write it in here that you can't use it for that purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6580.262s">And</a> there's no case to be proven that it can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6582.933s">Once</a> that's before you, I've got no problem, then the choice is yours. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6585.915s">But</a> I believe as it stands before you right now, you have an option to go another way to fund this if that be the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6591.438s">And</a> again, I respectfully disagree that you can fund, you can negotiate a contract that does take place in segments, not all together up front, because there in itself presents no guarantee to the city of Medford or to you folks that your vote is really gonna be worth anything if that person or that company falls or goes bankrupt or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6610.509s">Thank</a> you very much, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6611.689s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7731.739s">Once</a> again, my name is Robert Pantazero, Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7734.741s">I'm</a> a little bit confused here right now because I never remember sitting on this council in the month of December and voting on something that's projected as a deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7743.246s">Because</a> if you look at the sewer retained earnings like in the water retained earnings, I believe your budget is 50-50 in this past budget that you had, you did have a proposed increase of one.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7754.434s">Folks,</a> would you please quiet down back there?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7761.215s">If</a> you looked at your budget that you just passed this past year, I believe that there was somewhat of a minimal rate increase there from the water and sewer department. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7767.159s">I</a> mean, from the MWRA. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7769.4s">Also,</a> your sewer charge is at 121% of your water rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7773.363s">So</a> if you're at 121% of your water rate that the customer is paying out back out, but your water side is balanced, but your sewer side isn't balanced. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7782.549s">Is</a> somebody telling you that your budget proposal that was presented was inaccurate? <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7787.07s">Have</a> you ever gone through this before, making a paid on a deficit, a projected deficit, and you're not even what? <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7794.817s">You're</a> just no more than six months into your budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7798.32s">So</a> that means your budget that was presented to you that you guys and ladies passed was in deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7803.704s">It</a> was a deficit budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7805.005s">It</a> was incorrect. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7806.727s">You</a> were operating with deficits in departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7809.349s">It</a> doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7810.53s">I</a> really think you need to take a second look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7813.081s">And</a> I know she's new to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7815.222s">I</a> don't know if she's new to this whole idea of where we're going with this and if you want to put this in a projection because you want to set a tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7821.585s">But</a> how do you set a tax rate on a deficit when you've already been here and you haven't even been programmed or been told? <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7828.108s">This</a> is one thing this council has asked for over and over again on a monthly updated status report. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7833.411s">If</a> you were traveling down this road and you knew there was going to be a deficit, you should have been told. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7838.993s">Not</a> two weeks before Christmas. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7841.114s">And</a> to give the taxpayers once again, <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7843.237s">another</a> Christmas surprise of taking money out of their surplus account that should be used, should be used only for water and stormwater drain construction here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7854.405s">I</a> don't know how this city is operating lately, but all I can tell you is this, this is a radical change in what it used to be, and it's not going in the right direction.<h2><a href="../2016-12-14_AXh4iBqkQq0/2016-12-14_AXh4iBqkQq0.html">Medford, MA City Council - Nov. 29, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=157.352s">My</a> name is Robert Petter, a former member of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=159.603s">When</a> I was reviewing the offering by Councilor Knight this evening, my question, I think, presents itself in a different direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=166.528s">I</a> mean, we've spent over $14.5 million for a brand new building. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=170.552s">It's</a> obvious that certain departments are understaffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=173.714s">And</a> this may be a good way to look at actually what is going on in the highway department as it relates to men, the equipment that they have, and everything that's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=183.382s">And</a> the fact that if this is going to be, I think, is your intent to create another department? <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=188.245s">Is</a> that what you said, Councilor Knight? <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=190.153s">stand</a> alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=190.773s">I</a> don't know if that's a contractual obligation that has to be negotiated through the union. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=194.534s">I</a> mean, it presents itself with a whole bunch of issues, but the best part of the issue I think is this, that I think the council really needs to take a look and see as to what's going on over there, the highway department or the public works building. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=205.678s">I</a> mean, I don't really know if you have a director or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=207.598s">He</a> was on a three months on trial basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=209.979s">It</a> ended in March. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=210.879s">I</a> don't know if they're still advertising for a new director's position. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=213.911s">But</a> I think it would be beneficial if he was here tonight to discuss the matter.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=224.759s">Is</a> that public knowledge that he's been? <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=226.18s">I</a> mean, are you councillors aware of the fact that he's been appointed? <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=230.263s">Pardon</a> me? <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=231.604s">Well,</a> this is the problem of not getting information out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=235.788s">I</a> mean, some councillors know, some don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=237.749s">I,</a> as a public person, don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=239.01s">And</a> I try to stay on top of what's going on here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=241.836s">But</a> more importantly, just getting back to this issue in particular, my suggestion would be, and if I was on your side of the rail, I would suggest that if we're going to be looking at this, maybe we should be looking at all the departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=252.561s">And</a> if this, in fact, is a union type of job, and this is contractual, I believe the membership themselves have to vote on this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=260.205s">So</a> while it sounds good, I just think it needs to be researched, and I think it's the best time to look at the whole offering in the Department of Public Works.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1252.13s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1252.71s">Good</a> evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1253.15s">Please</a> state your name and address. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1254.31s">My</a> name is Bob Penta, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1256.831s">I'm</a> a member of the cyclist body. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1258.531s">You</a> know, one of the things that I think is a concerning point is while the meeting might be held tomorrow night, it's not really being held where the public can actually see it and view it. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1267.133s">There</a> are a lot of people who might like to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1269.003s">and</a> just can't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1269.824s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1270.565s">We</a> don't have any public access, so that's another two points against us. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1274.929s">But</a> more importantly, I think some of these proposed changes and discussions that take place stand to be corrected, go back to 2004 and then 2008. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1284.117s">And</a> for them to be sitting in the committee for a long period of time such as that with no intent to either add or subtract to them or eliminate them, <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1292.78s">In</a> the being brought up now you know is of a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1296.423s">You</a> have some concerns in here relative toward open public forums and public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1304.648s">And</a> if you read it the way it's being written unless the words are going to be changed someone's going to have to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1311.467s">at</a> six o'clock at night if they want to talk on the subject matter before the council, and then if they want to talk... Point of clarification, Mr. President, and this is why I'd rather not have this conversation now, because the paper still hasn't been presented.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1335.604s">Right,</a> and that's why we're going to discuss this all tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1338.746s">But,</a> Mr. President, with all due respect, <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1340.458s">If</a> this is the report that came out, an eight-page report, okay, and it's Councilor Longo-Curran and it's Councilor Marksley's alluded to, it would have been nice to have it highlighted. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1348.041s">It</a> did take some time to go review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1350.382s">Then</a> why not discuss this right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1353.604s">What's</a> being, what's wrong with, we're talking about highlights. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1356.685s">That's</a> all we're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1358.066s">And</a> these are important points for people to maybe want to come tomorrow night and understand what's going on.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1403.784s">But</a> I believe, Mr. President, this was came out of committee in August. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1407.485s">This</a> is now October. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1408.946s">So</a> there was a few months lag in between. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1411.767s">And</a> now you're asking your honorable body to review this in a matter of a few days. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1415.749s">Eight</a> pages, very small, minuscule print. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1419.036s">But</a> that's not the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1419.957s">The</a> fact of the matter is this involves the taxpayers of this community.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1438.336s">We're</a> going to discuss this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1442.398s">No,</a> that's not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1443.18s">I</a> don't think it's the Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1444.823s">It's</a> been referred to a Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1446.748s">And</a> since you're referring something to the Committee of the Whole, are you telling me that all seven of you? <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1450.947s">are</a> going to be afraid to discuss it before tomorrow night, to let the taxpayers know some of the issues that are on the agenda, Mr. President, that they might want to come.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1460.549s">It's</a> on your agenda for tomorrow night.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1471.271s">That's</a> the issue at point, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1474.852s">There</a> are some very salient points here that operate against the taxpayer <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1479.713s">coming</a> to this podium when they would like to speak on a subject matter more than once. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1485.294s">Also</a> suspension of the rules as an issue more than once. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1489.035s">And</a> we can go through this if you want to, page by page. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1491.456s">That's</a> not my intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1492.776s">My</a> intent is to talk about some highlights that directly affect any taxpayer in this audience to come up here and have an opportunity to speak like right now, which a new rules is promulgated. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1503.899s">They</a> will not, if it's voted upon by this body, you won't be able to do it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1522.969s">Well,</a> my remarks that I would like to wrap up, Mr. President, is the fact that on tomorrow night you're going to be discussing things that are going to restrict council. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1531.154s">I</a> mean, citizen participation at this podium on more than one occasion. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1534.896s">It's</a> done three deliberate <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1536.863s">If</a> the council so votes, there's going to be three opportunities where a citizens will not be able to do what's taking place here right now, coming up and speaking on something, whether it's on the agenda or suspension of the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1548.838s">And</a> then the craziness of saying that the craziness of saying that is not wrap it up, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1554.045s">And</a> the craziness of saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1555.847s">that</a> if one Councilor chastises another one, he has to be scolded by whoever the president is, and apologize, and he won't be able to speak until the apology takes place. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1566.216s">What</a> are we talking about here? <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1567.357s">This</a> is child's play. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1568.578s">This</a> is going to be discussed in the Committee of the Whole, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1570.919s">Well,</a> these are part of the rules that are being promulgated. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1572.861s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1859.722s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1861.464s">Just</a> a quick point of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1863.625s">It's</a> not on the city's website. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1865.093s">And</a> for the folks who have found out today, it was a citizen taxpayer who put it on a Facebook page, and that's how people became aware of it, because they couldn't get the gut of what this whole thing was about on the city's webpage. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1878.26s">Thank</a> you, sir.<h2><a href="../2025-03-18_2SyhnAlrcqY/2025-03-18_2SyhnAlrcqY.html">Medford, MA City Council - Oct. 4, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3699.245s">Hope</a> to see you all there.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4227.518s">Good</a> evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4228.058s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4228.499s">Please</a> state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4230.319s">My</a> name is Robert Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4231.279s">I</a> live at zero summit road, former member of the Sargas party. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4234.62s">Uh,</a> let's take a reflect back on what council car viola just indicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4237.82s">Uh,</a> having served on the council with your folks before it was on a couple of occasions that he pressed for the issue regarding a report forthcoming forthcoming forthcoming regarding this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4248.413s">The</a> last one that I seem to have that's available is dated December 4th of 2015, with a breakdown which does not include December of last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4258.335s">And</a> it's a little bit perplexing as it relates to, number one, the citations that were appealed, which were something like 3,054 year-to-date, and the citations that were dismissed, which was 1,375. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4270.198s">So</a> almost 45 percent of the citations that were issued up until November of last year were dismissed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4277.273s">but</a> then you go to the issue regarding strike that hearings and year to date there was 240 hearings and of those year to date hearings, I think 88 of them were dismissed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4289.899s">The</a> issue I think revolves around a whole host of contingencies on with this new pay to park, you can use your phone and what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4298.443s">Since</a> there is a new owner out there, I have seen certain problems that have existed personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4303.486s">Yale</a> Street parking lot, people in the lot after six o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4306.905s">giving</a> out tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4308.366s">Other</a> parts of the city, the new people that have come on board with this new company, and I don't know who they are because you guys don't have a contract, you should have a copy of the contract as amended, should indicate that these folks should be aware as to what they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4323.092s">Also,</a> the fact that you can't go out there, these folks are supposed to be identified with a tag on them, with a face on their ID card, so to speak, and not something that's hidden behind their jacket or what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4337.282s">and</a> I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4338.743s">The</a> other thing, and it's a concern, it's a bone of contention that I've had since day one, we were told during the last mayoral campaign by this mayor that seniors would be able to park for nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4348.208s">What</a> you have now is if a senior wants to park in the city, that senior has to pay $25 to have the opportunity to park for nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4355.651s">They</a> get a card or whatever it might be, and they can't transfer it to another car, because if you're a senior, and you happen to be 65, that's what they use for a standard, and 62 is social security age, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4366.73s">So</a> why it's 65 to be a senior, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4369.572s">But</a> if you get this little placard or whatever it might be, or sticker, you can't transfer it to another car. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4374.336s">So</a> if you're a senior driving in the city and your car is either broken down and you wanna use another car, because you are a senior, you should be able to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4382.742s">So</a> the requirement doesn't go to the senior, apparently it goes to the car and you're stuck to that particular car. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4388.647s">I</a> think that really needs to be reviewed and looked upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4391.389s">But</a> more importantly, I just think the statistical analysis should be forthcoming <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4395.935s">You</a> folks had asked for a monthly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4397.956s">The</a> last time you got it was eight months into the, nine months into the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4401.918s">It</a> just doesn't seem right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4403.239s">My</a> suggestion would be to have you have the new people, just like you had a Republic when they first come in, have them come and appear before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4411.383s">Air</a> your differences with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4412.684s">Let</a> them explain to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4414.144s">Let</a> them explain to the public what the changes might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4417.246s">You</a> know, it's kind of hard, you know, when people call up and they ask, you know, what can we do? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4421.328s">How</a> do we make this thing better? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4424.009s">Lady</a> comes to city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4425.638s">thinking</a> that she can pay her ticket here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4427.679s">She</a> can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4428.339s">And</a> while she's here trying to pay the ticket, she's outside and she's getting a ticket on her car. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4432.64s">And</a> she's coming in here thinking this is the way you're supposed to pay the ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4435.541s">You</a> go down the street to go to pay the ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4437.701s">And</a> then, oh, too bad, you can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4439.382s">You've</a> got a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4440.462s">You</a> stayed here too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4441.703s">There's</a> a whole host of issues that are still <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4443.572s">surrounding</a> this whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4444.913s">They're</a> into the neighborhoods, where resident parking takes place, and late at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4449.695s">These</a> things are just multiplying, and nothing seems to be getting better. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4452.716s">And</a> if you speak to some of the business people in the square, in all the squares, they'll basically tell you that there are more spots open now than there were before. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4460.119s">That's</a> great, but their business isn't getting any much better than it was before. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4463.921s">If</a> anything, it's getting less. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4465.942s">So</a> the only reprieve that was really given during this past year is when the mayor was in, Mayor McGlynn was here, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4471.825s">And</a> I guess he worked out a deal with Republic at that time, during the holidays, from November 4th to, I believe, January 3rd, that on the weekends, you didn't have to pay to use the meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4481.27s">But</a> that seems to be something that's not being worked out right now by this company. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4485.332s">I</a> don't know what they're going to do for the holidays this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4487.734s">It's</a> a new company. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4488.454s">They're</a> new in town. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4489.635s">But</a> I strongly suggest that you have them before you, rather than having these piecemeal approaches of people with concerns and complaints, because you really need to take a look at the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4499.08s">You</a> really need to know what they're doing in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4501.717s">And</a> Councilor Lungo-Koehn is right, asking for that because I think the time is near. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4505.818s">Your</a> holidays are right around the corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4512.64s">Any</a> questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4513.44s">Be</a> more than happy to answer them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4514.96s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4515.4s">Nice</a> to see you all smiling tonight. <a

(Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11134.786s">My</a> name is Robert Pentez, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11137.469s">I'm</a> a member of the Saugus body. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11139.455s">You</a> know, during this past campaign for the mayor's office, the term that the president and mayor used was partners in progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11145.538s">And</a> partners in progress doesn't seem to be the staple that took place during this particular budgetary season. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11151.282s">As</a> Councilor Lungo-Koehn has alluded to, if you only got three minutes of the mayor and the initial presentation of a budget, and then you had to fend for yourself after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11159.866s">And</a> I think one of the comments, and I don't know what councilor made it, that many, many questions were asked more this year than ever before. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11166.64s">This</a> probably is a result of the answers worth forthcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11169.221s">That's</a> why you ask so many questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11171.402s">But</a> a few of the things that I'd like to highlight, and this particular budget starts going back to a year ago, when this former budget was being presented by Louise Miller. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11180.146s">The</a> question was asked of her twice, and it was by myself, when Mr. Scarpelli, Council Counsel Scott Scarpelli is sitting, would you present the budget in the same way it has been presented? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11188.83s">And</a> she said no. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11190.031s">And</a> we went through the idea of presenting the budget that had <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11193.262s">a</a> wish list of a cost analysis of each and every department had bringing forth that for which they wanted. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11199.444s">Now</a> you didn't get it this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11200.645s">And</a> unfortunately, why? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11201.585s">I</a> don't know, because you have the same mayor who was the former budget director who relinquished that position to give it to Louise mill, who presented the budget, who indicated to you at that point in time that you would be getting hopefully a budget that would handle the request of the council that you didn't get. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11216.07s">But</a> I guess we're talking about old school and it just didn't come to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11220.093s">So</a> some of the things that I would be concerned about if I was still sitting on your side would be a new police station, something that you, Councilor De La Ruza, alluded to some three to four years ago as the number one priority of the Medford City Council, a brand new police station for the police officers of this city and for the safety and the concern of the citizens of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11238.74s">Absolutely</a> no discussion about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11241.301s">It</a> was a bone of contention during this past campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11244.182s">President's</a> administration says it would be a minimum of seven years out. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11247.667s">And</a> we all know right now what's going on in that police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11250.208s">You</a> know, it's rat infested. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11252.209s">It</a> has mold in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11253.569s">It</a> has police officers that are sick. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11255.39s">And</a> it just cannot accommodate the everyday needs of a modern society, a police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11261.952s">You</a> know, just a little real quick, when you talked about the box lunches for the workers on Election Day, it's interesting where the mayor found the money to have the mayor's office done completely over. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11272.336s">But</a> we can't find the money to take care, unfortunately, the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11275.417s">who</a> work on a daily basis, once a year or twice a year, depending on the primary and the final elections that take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11282.302s">You</a> know, I think it's a service, minimal as it might be, that they deserve something having. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11287.165s">I</a> haven't heard anybody talk about the fact that, I know there's approximately $20,000 in the budget that the mayor is required to put in, and she has to pay the entire cost of what you folks have hired an outside attorney to bring the 61 Locust Street issue to bear in hand, but nobody's talked about <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11304.227s">which</a> has been on the council agenda for many years, of looking at a new fire station on Riverside Avenue and possibly looking at a satellite fire station that sits on the opposite side of Wellington Station, where the station landing is, where the new development of 200 more units are going up, which are right opposite the Wellington Station, plus the whole commercial industrial area over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11325.943s">And</a> I think that's something that really needs to be addressed, over and beyond the fact that if you look at your budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11331.445s">In</a> this year's budget, your fire department overtime money was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11336.788s">But</a> once again, on the annual basis, on the police department side, their overtime money wasn't there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11341.992s">It</a> has to be transferred each and every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11344.573s">Now</a> that's a serious question to ask, because they range anywhere from $400,000 to $600,000 a year in overtime, where the fire department has their money in overtime built right in. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11354.68s">Why</a> that happens in the police department, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11357.141s">But</a> if you want a true and accurate accounting of what overtime costs, <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11360.169s">or</a> projected overtime costs, that money should be definitive right in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11365.53s">Also,</a> you built a new $14.1 million Department of Public Works building. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11370.391s">It's</a> understaffed, and you don't have the right equipment to do all the jobs that are necessary on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11375.852s">Right</a> now, you're dealing with an interim temporary supervisor, a director of the building over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11382.574s">I</a> just don't know where it's going. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11384.474s">And</a> a lot of this click it, fix it idea of what are being asked to be fixed, <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11389.217s">are</a> being mocked off as being completed, and they haven't even been addressed, they haven't even been resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11393.758s">And</a> why these things are being resolved through the Department of Public Works, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11397.76s">If</a> somebody's making a mistake or it's an error, for whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11402.101s">Also,</a> you talked about, Councilman Marks, you also alluded to the fact that $400,000 from the water and sewer on the school department and the city side is basically borne by the taxpayers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11412.804s">You</a> know, it's an interesting analysis because many years ago, when we were talking about the new INI that was coming in, <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11418.88s">and</a> we were doing High Street, and the MWRA was in here putting in new water lines, especially at the intersection of Governor's Avenue and High Street, there was a project cost in that particular area of quite a few dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11433.064s">I</a> forget the exact amount, so I won't lead it to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11435.785s">But</a> part of the mitigation that took place as a result of that is they had to do High Street, I believe from Medford Square, a little bit past CVS, <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11444.865s">to</a> do that street over as part of the mitigation for the cost of putting these two things in there, relining the street and making the connections right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11453.472s">As</a> a matter of fact, I think it was right out in front of Carlings where the sewer just fell into the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11458.356s">And</a> I think a lady got hurt, and that was precipitous of what took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11462.539s">But</a> the $400,000 is just a drop in the bucket to the $8.5 million that's presently sitting <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11467.767s">and</a> the water and sewer account, you know, and what major projects do you have lined up where those monies can be expended? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11475.011s">I</a> mean, I didn't hear it, I didn't see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11476.631s">I</a> think last week there was a conversation with some folks on looking at cities and, I mean, streets to be done, and I believe Evans Street was one of them that they were talking about, and I believe the comment was that we'll be getting to the water and sewer portion of it, but we probably won't get to the paving of it until next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11493.62s">I</a> just hope that this council is not getting buffaloed <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11496.114s">and</a> to passing a budget that's not taking an understanding into what streets are going to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11501.258s">And</a> then all of a sudden next year, in election year, all these streets decided to get done. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11505.48s">And</a> a major cost is going to come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11507.582s">And</a> maybe this is what this whole capital improvement program is going to be all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11510.984s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11511.825s">But</a> it's not fair for the people who have been waiting year in and year out, waiting for their street to be done, waiting for their manholes on their street to be fixed, waiting for their sidewalks to be taken care of, waiting for their tree stumps to be removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11524.41s">And</a> the number that you were given a few weeks ago is absolutely wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11527.212s">There's</a> many more than two to three to 400 tree stumps that are out there that need to be corrected and taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11533.036s">You</a> also, um, and in the last election, we talked about the CPA, whether you were for it or against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11540.3s">And</a> here you are in June, almost seven months later, and there's still no definitive program. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11545.664s">There</a> is still nothing out there to tell the people what that money is going to be used for and when it's going to be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11550.654s">And</a> if you look at the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, they don't even know if they're going to be able to fund it this year, because they're behind on revenues and revenue projections that they had anticipated coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11559.9s">So</a> the people of this community have to have an understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11562.261s">If</a> you voted for the CPA for the 1.5%, I believe that's what they voted for, as the override on your taxes, over and beyond your taxes, which to me is an end run of Proposition 2.5, but that's nearly over there, you're still going to be funding the whole thing on your own. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11575.45s">And</a> you're not going to be getting that for which you thought the match was going to be from the state, because they just don't have the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11580.57s">And</a> unfortunately, you're stuck with it for five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11583.251s">But</a> I think I believe that it's in Councilor Knight's committee that you're working on, the ad hoc committee, and waiting to make a finality of where it's going to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11594.813s">And</a> hopefully, the recommendation will come out, and people will have an opportunity to discuss it, and you can get a feeling of where you're going to be going. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11604.855s">There's</a> been absolutely no upgrading. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11606.905s">On</a> the antiquated cable casting of this council chamber, what transmits over cable television, whether it be Comcast or Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11614.688s">Verizon</a> seems to have a better signal going out rather than Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11618.229s">This</a> building hasn't been touched for well over 30 years, and I would suggest that you do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11622.45s">And</a> then you have an excess of the cable access money, an excess of $550,000 just sitting there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11629.913s">And</a> it's never been done, and it's never been done to be used to correct this particular building over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11637.118s">There's</a> a whole bunch of things that you folks have been getting into. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11640.44s">One</a> of the things I want to compliment the council on, and you took the bull by the horns for the last couple of weeks, is the Locust Street project. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11648.066s">That's</a> 61 Locust Street, 490 unit project on Locust Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11651.929s">I</a> compliment you publicly because it really is an issue that is disturbing to the neighborhood and it'll destroy the entire fabric, not only of the Wellington neighborhood, it has an immediate impact on the entire city of Medford, if in fact that were to come to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11665.688s">Without</a> going through all the particulars and all the facts that are relegated to it, I thank you for taking that position and voting seven to nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11672.694s">Very</a> rare do you get seven to nothing vote on something like this, but you did the right thing on this particular- You have one minute, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11677.499s">Pardon</a> me?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11678.76s">You</a> did the right thing as it relates to this particular subject matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11683.624s">I</a> just want to conclude probably by saying that I would hope you have a new budget director coming on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11692.131s">has</a> been here for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11693.432s">I</a> happen to like Anne, and I think she does a good job, and I think she's a very honest person. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11697.334s">But</a> I think she was put in a very tough situation as it relates to presenting not only the budget before you folks, but before the Medford City Council and city government. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11705.919s">So</a> I thank you for your efforts, Anne. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11708.28s">But</a> more importantly, I would just hope this council gets its act together by demanding from this mayor that before any budget comes forward, before any capital improvement comes forward, she sits down with you personally, not an emissary, <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11720.43s">When</a> in fact, she did have a representative who was supposed to be your council emissary. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11724.171s">She's</a> not here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11725.451s">They're</a> never here. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11726.171s">Unfortunately,</a> you have to do this on your own and vote on it on your own. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11729.732s">So</a> once again, I thank you for listening to my comments and at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11745.916s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11747.136s">I</a> just want to thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11748.417s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11749.317s">Without</a> calling you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_2MzH8zDWQL0/2025-03-21_2MzH8zDWQL0.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 21, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3901.807s">My</a> name is Robert Penter, I live at Zero Summit Road, former member of the Sarkis party. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3905.929s">I</a> want to thank Mr. Reid for coming forward here, because I think he's bringing to the attention of our public the fact that our streets and the needs of our streets, whether they be sidewalks, whether they be curbings, whether they be the underground infrastructure, is in a desperate need of, how can you say, a revisiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3923.537s">You</a> folks haven't seen this, and not to digress, but I will digress, going back to last year during the campaign, this was a big issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3930.461s">People</a> in this community are very concerned about their streets, the potholes in their streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3935.645s">The</a> people are not getting any response back. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3938.507s">I</a> mean, the city now signs on to this quote, unquote, complete streets program. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3944.311s">Do</a> a street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3945.372s">Get</a> a street done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3946.793s">Don't</a> get it to the point that it is right now that people are coming up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3950.696s">And</a> I know there's going to be another gentleman that's going to come up here and he's going to talk about <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3954.697s">a</a> street that the city owns that they haven't done that was part of a $14.4 million project. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3960.058s">And</a> it just doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3962.139s">You</a> know, the council has asked, and you, acting president Marks, you would ask for an annual monthly go along to see where the budget's going. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3972.301s">And</a> I think last year Louise Miller said, she said it twice, right here at this podium, she would have never presented the budget the way it's been, as it's been in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3980.434s">and</a> she would put your wish list in there, and she would show the cost and where and how it would go. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3985.136s">Well,</a> I think you folks do have an obligation as city councilors, because I know I accepted it when I sat on that side of the rail, to have monthly meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3992.679s">So</a> have meetings with your department heads to find out exactly what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3997.181s">The</a> rumor around this building that the city engineer, she's on a six-month to a one-year review for her job performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4003.624s">True</a> or false or indifferent, I don't know, but that's the rumor running around the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4007.779s">But</a> whether it's a rumor or not, the fact of the matter is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4011.204s">The</a> streets in this city are in desperate need of not only repair, but a review. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4015.75s">The</a> public works department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4019.216s">Their</a> short chains would help, but at the same time, their direction is not being geared into the purpose of what it's there for. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4026.121s">What's</a> the most important thing that's affecting this community right now on a daily basis? <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4031.365s">All</a> of a sudden, they just got through painting the stripes, the crosswalks and the stripes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4036.428s">School</a> is out and the stripes are done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4038.25s">This</a> should have been done when school was in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4040.771s">Prime</a> time of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4041.772s">It</a> used to be done twice a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4042.973s">It</a> used to cost $60,000 a year when Mayor McGlynn was here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4046.215s">Now</a> he's only been out a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4047.156s">$60,000</a> a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4048.92s">paint</a> the crosswalks and the stripes, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4051.184s">Twice</a> a year, it's a public safety issue, why not? <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4053.87s">But</a> look at your streets, look at your sidewalks, look at your curbing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4057.757s">Mr.</a> Reed brought, I think, some excellent points forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4061.178s">not</a> to sit here and advocate for him to be an employee of the city, but he did work for this city, and he did do a good job, and he did bring these attentions to the engineering department, and we're still talking about him. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4071.601s">After</a> the fact, still talking about him. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4074.102s">It's</a> just symptomatic on how this entire administration operates. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4077.864s">After</a> the fact, no public acknowledgement, and this council, you know, I don't know what this mayor thinks of this council, but it's quite obvious. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4085.508s">She</a> doesn't have you in high regards at all, because you folks have absolutely no idea as to what's going on outside this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4092.474s">You</a> do the best you can. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4093.755s">You</a> read it in the newspaper. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4094.956s">You</a> talk amongst yourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4096.963s">But</a> unfortunately, if this city keeps going in the direction it's going, it'll have no direction to go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4101.745s">It's</a> going to be out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4103.426s">And</a> it is out of control right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4105.287s">Locust</a> Street is the best example of telling you what's happening in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4109.569s">An</a> out-of-control situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4111.43s">Just</a> think of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4112.25s">You</a> folks had to go hire your own attorney to sue the Board of Appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4116.352s">and</a> for which this mayor thought this was a great project here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4119.695s">It's</a> going to add a wonderful new neighborhood and we're excited about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4124.038s">We</a> are so excited about it, it's going to cost you hundreds and thousands of dollars because now the council is going to sue your board of appeals that your city solicitor has to defend. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4132.986s">And</a> the neighbors have to go out and get their lawyer for they have to pay for it because they're not going to get pushed around by city hall who never asked them to be part of it or to be included. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4142.393s">It's</a> like a bad street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4144.074s">If</a> you don't fix it, it gets worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4146.595s">Well,</a> it's the public relations of this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4149.496s">It's</a> worse now than it was when it started, and it's not getting any better. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4153.097s">And</a> I would hope that this Medford City Council puts its foot down and tells this mayor that before you do anything and go forward, we want to be a part of it, and our city streets, we want to be a part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4164.581s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_hFAk--zIv7g/2025-03-21_hFAk--zIv7g.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 14, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4669.494s">My</a> name is Robert Penter. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4670.615s">I</a> live at zero summit road, former member of this August party. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4674.176s">You</a> know, we're not a city that's rising from the ashes. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4678.395s">There</a> hasn't been a catastrophe in this city, and we shouldn't be looked upon as a community that the Trojan horses come in, which is development. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4686.601s">And</a> development, just for the sake of development, doesn't mean it's always good for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4691.524s">When</a> that decision was rendered this morning, I took all afternoon to review it, page by page, word by word. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4698.248s">Fourteen</a> pages of a hastily written decision because <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4702.523s">The</a> board, I believe, did not want to hear what this Medford City Council wanted to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4707.264s">And</a> the city solicitor is absolutely right, because I've checked the cases and other cases that reflect upon the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4712.946s">You</a> folks, you are the master of the zoning of this city of Medford, not the board of appeals, because that's what they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4719.607s">People</a> go to them on an appeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4721.008s">But</a> you folks, you write the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4724.048s">The</a> zoning begins and ends here, goes through whatever the process might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4728.549s">So</a> you have every right to not only appeal this decision, <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4731.632s">but</a> to appeal it as loudly and as strongly as you can. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4735.273s">On</a> page five of the decision, the commentary says it completes the zoning, the industrial zoning, except for heightened use. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4745.116s">Now,</a> this is an industrial piece of property, which is allowed to have certain exemptions that you don't have. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4752.017s">But</a> the heightened use relegates itself to the multiple dwelling portion. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4758.48s">We</a> can go back to 1988. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4759.381s">There</a> was a company called Asano and White. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4762.023s">They</a> did a, I think it was a $70,000, $80,000 report here in the city of Medford as it reflects upon housing, development, traffic impact, and water and sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4772.57s">And</a> the Wellington Glenwood area was one of the particular areas that they did it on. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4777.674s">And</a> Councilman Marks alluded to the fact on page eight, the topography of the land. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4781.937s">The</a> board says that a substantial part of the property, if it's not developed with multiple dwelling, <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4789.03s">In</a> the ordinance, the industrial zone, in essence, will become inoperative because it'll just stay industrial and you can't do anything with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4796.497s">I</a> think there's one point that hasn't been said thus far, unless somebody else wants to say it later on. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4801.242s">Don't</a> forget, when these folks came on March 31st and before that, they didn't say no to the development. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4806.226s">They</a> were conciliatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4807.828s">They</a> said, reduce the size of the project, make it smaller if you can, and I think the people could live with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4814.117s">But</a> that didn't take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4815.757s">If</a> you read the decision regarding 7 Canal Street, the very last paragraph, as written by the board, basically says, and I read it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4827.879s">It's</a> kind of interesting, that decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4829.94s">It</a> says the following, in conclusion, the board is hopeful that the developer will reconsider the size and scope of the proposed apartment building. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4838.161s">There</a> is much to commend the overall project in such close proximity to public transportation <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4843.469s">including</a> the commuter rail. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4845.59s">Now,</a> in that decision, they talked about the abutters that showed up. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4849.532s">In</a> this 14-page decision, there's nothing about an abutter that showed up, nothing about the concerns that they had. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4855.714s">All</a> they talked about was the fact that this is going to be great for that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4860.296s">April</a> 27th of this year, Mayor Burke of this community said this is a great project to develop a new neighborhood in this part of town. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4866.939s">We're</a> excited about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4868.725s">But</a> where is the transparency, the open public meeting on zoning of this nature? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4873.447s">Because</a> you folks have never had a development this large smack you in the face. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4877.828s">And</a> since you've all been here, you've never had an audience like this who are so upset over the fact that they weren't a part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4883.51s">They're</a> coming in after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4885.01s">They</a> should have been here before the fact, before this honorable body. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4888.391s">You</a> folks wrote the law, and you should be well aware of what's going on upstairs in that Board of Appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4901.968s">You</a> know, in the decision, it's relegated to the terms. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4908.155s">They</a> state the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4910.358s">We</a> respect the fact that this zoning and site plan review fits the standards of this particular project. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4922.39s">This</a> is the wording of the zoning and the site plan review. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4925.112s">The</a> purpose of our zoning is to promote the health, safety, morals, convenience, and to lessen the danger from congestion and confusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4933.198s">Site</a> plan review states the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4935.28s">The</a> purpose of this article is to promote development, which is harmonious with surrounding areas and adequate consideration of abutting land owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4944.247s">Well,</a> we have abutting land owners here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4947.149s">Where</a> were their concerns is written in this document. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4949.791s">It's</a> nowhere to be found. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4951.418s">And</a> if it's nowhere to be found here, it's quite obvious that they didn't take it into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4955.68s">And</a> Councilman Marks, again, alluded to the fact that we relied on department head reports, and we relied on their reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4963.064s">Kind</a> of interesting, the folks that, Vanessa Hagan, who was the consultant they had for the traffic study, is the same one that they had for Canal Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4971.748s">And</a> that was only four stories high and for 30 units. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4975.612s">This</a> is 490 units high, 490 units and five stories high. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4981.838s">Big</a> difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4982.939s">But</a> let's get to the bottom line. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4983.941s">What</a> are you going to have here for the bottom line? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4985.402s">Because</a> it's the impact that's going to affect the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4988.185s">This</a> is what you're going to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4989.146s">You're</a> going to have coal. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4990.027s">If</a> everybody's online and all the developments are coming on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4993.617s">You'll</a> have Coles, you'll have Marshalls, you'll have Wegmans, you'll have Lumineer. <a

people may not do the same thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5006.101s">Come</a> in. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5006.442s">Hi,</a> Hawaii. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5007.042s">See</a> you later. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5007.782s">Make</a> a fast buck. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5008.702s">Who</a> pays for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5009.463s">The</a> neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5010.542s">Then</a> you're going to have the skating rink over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5012.284s">Then</a> you're going to have the 490 units. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5013.946s">Then</a> you're going to have eight commercial businesses, three apartment buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5017.33s">And</a> now let's take a ride down Locust Street and bang a left and go to Wellington Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5022.096s">You're</a> going to have 200 more units of apartment housing going over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5025.82s">And</a> don't forget the casino when that opens up. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5027.882s">You</a> put this all together. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5029.544s">And</a> you take Little Locust Street, which is a two-way street, it's going to make no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5034.227s">If</a> this administration had any brains, they would have called you into that office over there, sat down with you and said, what do you think, guys? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5040.452s">This</a> is what I think I'd like to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5042.173s">Can</a> we add or subtract to it and come up with a unified front? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5045.555s">No,</a> you have an administration that just goes on their own way and now you're here to pick up the slack. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5050.861s">And</a> what's the slack? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5051.882s">You're</a> going to have to take money and appeal it on behalf of the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5055.606s">And</a> I would expect you folks, do appeal it and do spend that money and send the message back to that office over there that you guys and gals are not patsies for someone else's administration when you're not even brought in and consulted. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5067.718s">There</a> is no transparency to what's going on in this city right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5070.94s">And</a> this is the perfect example when you look at a development such as this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5074.681s">This</a> should never be happened without your consideration and consultation. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5089.709s">You</a> know, we get elected for one reason, or I got elected for one reason when I was on that side of the rail, to do the people's business. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5096.783s">not</a> to sit here and wonder what I'm supposed to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5099.506s">If</a> you're brand new, it's a learning process, then you better learn real quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5102.669s">Because</a> you know what you're dealing with? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5103.69s">You're</a> dealing with the taxpayers' money. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5105.231s">You're</a> dealing with their direction in how this city is supposed to go forward, whether it's on the school department side when you take that final vote, or whether it's on the city side when you're putting all your money together to find out in what direction are we going to be able to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5117.223s">Now,</a> you have a budget coming up right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5119.98s">And</a> in this particular budget, as the councilor, Mr. Rumley alluded to, you should make the request tonight to put a minimum of $50,000 in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5127.604s">And</a> I'm going to tell you the reason why. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5129.865s">A</a> few years ago, when I was on this city council, we had a decision to be made regarding Tufts University on a piece of land that they wanted to take and they wanted to use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5140.19s">I</a> think it was Foley, Holg, Elliott and Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5143.492s">I</a> think it was a hundred thousand dollars would cost the city, but the city won its case. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5147.994s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5148.63s">because</a> the council was determined when they took that vote that we weren't going to get pushed around and we weren't going to have the Dover Amendment used against us because it was inappropriate at that particular time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5157.916s">I</a> think it was 1991 or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5161.202s">But</a> you've got to be realistic about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5162.822s">You've</a> got to move ASAP. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5164.243s">Plus</a> another thing, Mr. Rumley, you can correct me if I'm wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5166.903s">If</a> you guys and girls are going to come on board and appeal this case, you can ask for an extension of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5171.464s">Same</a> thing that the visiting nurses did. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5173.224s">I</a> believe they got a six-month extension of time when the taxpayers decided or the abutters decided to appeal this particular case. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5185.406s">In</a> 1985, I made an offer of a resolution before this Method City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5189.427s">None</a> of you were on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5190.872s">That's</a> why I'm still here, because I remember these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5193.378s">I</a> got a bag full of tricks. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5194.8s">that</a> tells me what to remember every single time, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5198.461s">I</a> made a resolution to put a moratorium on building and construction in the city of Medford because at that point in time, you had high-rise condominiums going up with no rhyme and no reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5208.125s">And</a> if you didn't take a look and see where you wanted your city to go and the traffic impact it would have, the social impact, the educational impact.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5217.348s">And</a> the educational impact, you would have no idea where you're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5220.609s">And</a> then again in 2005, I filed the same resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5224.368s">Miffitt</a> City Council in both times approved it, and both times the city administration did not want to embark upon it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5230.51s">You</a> know, it sounds nice to say, if this development takes place, I think we're going to get, here it goes, we're going to get approximately $1.5 million in building permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5241.175s">We're</a> going to get approximately $2 million in linkage. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5243.615s">We're</a> going to get approximately $1.375,000 in tax money. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5250.606s">You</a> know, money just for the sake of money should not make this city drive itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5255.243s">You</a> know what should drive this community? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5257.103s">The</a> heart of every single person in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5259.344s">How</a> you can get along, how you can live together, how your streets can be compatible, how your schools, your churches, and your neighbors can be compatible. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5266.846s">Not</a> to have a group of people come in here tonight, frustrated over the fact this is after the fact, and now you're picking up the ball and going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5275.488s">This</a> should not be. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5276.868s">They</a> should be coming here tonight congratulating you because you stopped it early on and it came before you at an appropriate time.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5283.79s">I</a> hope this is a warning, Mr. President, and all members of the council, that you go forward, hire the attorney, and I'm quite sure that you will win. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5291.771s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5292.592s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3734.503s">My</a> name is Robert Penter. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3735.504s">I</a> live at zero summit road, Medford mass, a former member of this August body. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3739.908s">Uh,</a> to get to council night's question brought up at the council, at the, uh, appeals meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3743.911s">And</a> that's an industrially zoned piece of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3746.193s">Number</a> one, and it's 490 units that are being asked over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3750.436s">There</a> are 11 variances that were being presented, 11 variances more than any other time. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3755.3s">And</a> I believe all 11 of them were asking for relief. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3758.37s">And</a> according to the preliminary decision, they've been granted. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3761.553s">That's</a> an awful lot of variances on a one single piece of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3766.238s">I</a> think folks really need to understand something, that that night on that, it was an extremely hard night. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3771.903s">And</a> the residents that were there, they waited all night long to make sure that their comments were made, while the developer took as much time as needed, and rightfully so, to present their position. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3781.772s">But</a> there were some comments that some folks still wanted to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3784.433s">Unfortunately,</a> at the very end, they weren't allowed to because I don't know if it was because of the time or for whatever the reasons might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3791.296s">But</a> there are two sites and sections of our own municipal laws that need to be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3796.398s">And</a> that's Chapter 94, Section 1, which is our zoning ordinance, which says that the change cannot cause congestion or confusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3804.101s">And</a> also under our site plan review under Section 94, Section 33.1, <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3811.439s">excuse</a> me, section 331, it states that the community, the neighborhood has to be taken into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3817.166s">Is</a> it compatible with the neighborhood as it relates to this? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3820.81s">Now,</a> just think of the traffic on the traffic issue alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3824.989s">You're</a> going to start off with the new Lumineers, which is 160 units. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3829.23s">Then</a> you have the ice skating rink. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3831.131s">Then</a> you have across the street, you have Coles and Marshalls. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3833.352s">Then</a> you're going to have the new Wegmans. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3835.092s">Then</a> you're going to have 490 units if that goes through, 7,000 square feet of office space. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3840.174s">Then</a> you're going to have, going down the street a little bit further, two office buildings, and I think there's six remaining commercial pieces of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3847.996s">Take</a> that and then go to Wellington Circle, where 200 more units of affordable housing <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3854.335s">are</a> going to be taking place and coming on. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3857.417s">Now</a> just imagine in the middle of the day, 8, 9, 10, weekends, night times, whatever it might be, taking into consideration once the new casino comes in. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3867.602s">You</a> have Riverside Avenue, you have Locust Street, Mystic Valley Parkway, Harvard Street, and all the side streets that spin off of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3875.766s">Do</a> you realize how much traffic that that's going to cause? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3879.308s">And</a> for them to say it has no traffic input makes absolutely no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3883.785s">I</a> would respectfully ask whoever made that request for next Tuesday night to ask how they made that determination of no traffic input. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3892.387s">Because</a> the developer himself acknowledged that on an annual basis, at a minimum of 1%, traffic will increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3898.808s">And</a> they acknowledged by their own development that traffic will increase in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3903.689s">But</a> to get back to what you were talking about, smart growth, Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3907.21s">Some</a> years ago, I made an offering regarding growth and development here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3911.612s">for</a> which we didn't have any review with the prior administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3914.914s">We</a> asked for a moratorium for which at that point in time the council was in favor of, but the city's administration never went forward with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3921.878s">We</a> have no development that takes place in any part of this city that can tell you it's going to work, whether it be smart or not, whether it be compatible or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3932.784s">This</a> development that's taking place down there off of Riverside Avenue in the Wellington area has an environmental impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3940.022s">It</a> has a community impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3942.163s">It</a> has a neighborhood impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3944.424s">And</a> when you look at the development that's taking place by this developer wanting 490 units and a full packed room of residents that were there, and you go back a month prior to, and you look at the 40 units to a four-story building in West Medford that didn't have anywhere near the amount of complete neighborhood support for not wanting the project, how can you say one gets supported and one doesn't? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3970.421s">That</a> doesn't fit well. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3971.502s">It</a> doesn't bode well. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3972.342s">And</a> I'm glad that the majority of almost every one of you councilors are on board for not only having the meeting, but to having open public dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3978.666s">And</a> Councilor Lungo-Koehn is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3980.527s">Some</a> years ago when they were doing the 9th Street project, because it was such a large particular project, at that point in time the council asked, and the developer agreed, they came before the council, committee of the whole, and then before the council, and we had a complete community meeting on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3995.075s">Talked</a> about what units were going to be affordable, which ones weren't going to be affordable. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3999.721s">I</a> think it really needs to be understood, and I think Jeannie Martin, you said it right in the beginning, small-scale residential neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4009.587s">Even</a> if it's one person that's impacted, that's one too many. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4012.569s">And</a> when you get the administration, and this President Mayer and her administration, making the comment on April 27th, as reported in the paper, <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4019.912s">that</a> this is a great place to develop a new neighborhood and we're excited about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4024.376s">How</a> can you be excited about it when the neighborhood itself wasn't even aware of it, didn't even have an opportunity to come and speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4030.24s">Well,</a> maybe the Board of Appeals offered their opportunity for the public hearing and never got here. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4035.42s">You're</a> right when you're saying that your zoning should be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4038.241s">It</a> should be reviewed only because of the fact you don't want to keep going through things of this nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4042.643s">This</a> is a huge development. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4044.765s">This</a> isn't singular. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4045.805s">This</a> is coupled upon that for which is already there. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4049.247s">And</a> that for which is already there will totally decimate that particular neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4054.009s">This</a> isn't even a three or a four-way road. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4055.89s">This</a> is a two-way road going in. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4058.231s">And</a> just imagine all the stores that I just mentioned, Coles, Marshall, Wegmans. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4063.149s">Luminaires,</a> the ice skating rink, 490 units, 7,000 square feet of office space, two apartment buildings, and seven other, you know, public, other commercial pieces of property at any one point in time, at any one day. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4074.136s">What</a> do you think's gonna happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4075.977s">Councilman</a> Marks is right when he talks about what the three new stores that opened up on Riverside Avenue, on any one given night or weekend, or especially on holidays or shopping. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4084.803s">You</a> need not only smart development, you need a stop and look to see where this city is going. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4091.427s">Just</a> development for the sake of development doesn't mean anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4095.189s">If</a> you want to have something that reaches the niche of every single person, whether it be senior citizen housing, whether it be more medical space, whether it be more space for your education, or whatever it might be, I don't know if it's going to take $250,000, but I know this, you would want a complete community interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4114.818s">You</a> know, we don't have to be like some of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4117.45s">But</a> we can beg, borrow, and steal like Somerville does in a smaller way in smaller sections of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4123.173s">And</a> let us not forget one important thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4125.634s">At</a> that meeting last Tuesday night, the neighborhood was most conciliatory by saying it wasn't that they were against the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4133.698s">It</a> was way too large, didn't fit the neighborhood, and they were willing for something that would be much more reduced, that would be more compatible, and at least people could live with. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4142.664s">That's</a> all that they're looking for, something that they can live with, not something that's going to be thrown down their throat because they didn't have an opportunity for input, but more importantly, just because the city's going to garner approximately $2 million in taxes and approximately $1.6 million in linkage fees, this administration's looking at the money and they're cutting the beans as fast as they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4163.281s">And</a> who's going to pay for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4164.783s">The</a> neighborhood's going to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4166.785s">The</a> people who have been there, who have taken care of their property for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4170.33s">All</a> the side streets off of Riverside Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4172.632s">Try</a> to get off of Harvard Street now in the morning, add this to the congestion, and wait until Wellington Circle takes place and the 200 units over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4180.001s">Is</a> everybody going to have a car? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4181.202s">Absolutely</a> not. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4182.183s">But</a> even if it's 10% more on that road, it's 10% more that it can't handle. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4186.826s">We</a> have a police department that's in desperate need of help. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4189.548s">We</a> have a school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4190.669s">We</a> don't know if it's getting maxed out because of these units. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4193.231s">You</a> have a fire department that's stretched. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4194.792s">We</a> don't even know because the administration won't let them do a trial run into Wellington Circle to make sure we have a satellite fire station or a police station there for which the prior administration looked into but never did anything about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4207.642s">You</a> have so many issues that are confronting you here, and to have the Board of Appeals just vote preliminarily to go forward and grant the easement, it's only going to satisfy those money-hungry developers coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4219.948s">Look</a> at Lumineers. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4221.169s">They're</a> not even in there a year, and they sold out for $66.6 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4225.731s">Think</a> about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4226.712s">Who's</a> to say this company won't do the same thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4229.413s">But</a> there's one thing that you can't sell out, and that's the integrity and the brains of the people that live in the neighborhood, because they know what's right <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4237.755s">They</a> know what's good for them, and they're paying their taxes, and I'm quite sure they don't want their taxes paid for something like this, which is going to absolutely make their neighborhood a deplorable place to live. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4249.319s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10748.341s">My</a> motion.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10749.482s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10750.397s">I</a> can appreciate the idea that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10752.458s">Hunt</a> and the Energy Office has brought before the council, but I don't think her tenure here has been long enough to understand what the citizens of our community have expected. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10761.563s">We</a> can digress and go back a few years and talk about Stations Landing. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10765.024s">When</a> Stations Landing was coming here into the city of Medford, people, or we were told, that that would be the new panacea of no new growth in this community or a stability in growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10775.71s">And</a> we've all seen what's happened since that point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10778.333s">The</a> taxes have gone up each and every year while we've collected well in excess of a million and a half new dollars each and every year from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10785.395s">Now,</a> the next argument could possibly be the banks here in the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10789.757s">The</a> City of Medford goes out on a daily basis to get the best possible rate on interest rates for the money that they deposit. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10797.88s">Is</a> the City of Medford going to go out of its way now to tell the taxpayers of this community to go to a particular bank that they go to? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10805.222s">And</a> the more people that go to that bank, they're going to get a better interest rate? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10808.863s">because</a> we're getting a good interest rate, which is better than the bank that you're going to. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10813.644s">Same</a> thing with the insurance company. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10815.525s">We</a> have to buy our insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10816.685s">We</a> go out and we get the best bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10818.345s">The</a> best bid will probably be less than the bid that you, Mr. and Mrs. Medford, possibly might be getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10823.647s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10824.747s">But</a> Mr. Champ, you just brought up a very interesting point when you talked about water and sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10829.448s">You</a> folks have in your budget right now in excess of a $400,000 deficit or a debt on the water <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10836.389s">and</a> the suicide from the city and the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10839.331s">Why</a> isn't the city paying for that? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10841.272s">But</a> right now, they're so concerned about your electric bill, but they're not concerned about the $400,000 that every single taxpayer in this city is paying for because the school department in the city side won't account for their own water. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10854.682s">And</a> hopefully, you people will pass that when the budget comes. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10858.284s">You</a> know, you talk about the state legislature passing these laws, and I think you're right, Councilman Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10862.307s">I</a> think they got this upside down. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10864.682s">opting</a> in rather than opting out. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10867.082s">The</a> best way a community or a city can operate, when they talk to their taxpayers, when they have better communication, but when they don't have good communication, and the only public forum that they have is this council, and the rail here at this council that they can come up and talk, then that's what the conversation should be about. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10885.769s">You</a> shouldn't be talking about taking a vote which mandates somebody that they have to join, and then they might have to figure out when, within 180 days, have to opt out. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10895.953s">That's</a> not the right way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10897.634s">And</a> if we're going to expend municipal time through its employees on projects on behalf of every single taxpayer in this community, then why are you mandating it rather than making it voluntarily so you could show them this is a better way for you, Mr. and Mrs. Medford, to save money rather than be at the option of April or October to a $100,000 consultant <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10922.712s">who</a> was going to be making money trying to tell the city of Medford who might, on a particular day, get the best possible rate, and who might not get that best possible rate during that period of time, but the consultant still makes his money. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10935.556s">I</a> don't think this is a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10937.297s">I</a> think there are more important things to do here in the city of Medford, and I would hope that this Medford City Council does not entertain this particular matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10944.82s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_zvHrHUNZKmI/2025-03-21_zvHrHUNZKmI.html">Medford, MA City Council - May 24, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

<a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2900.653s">I</a> don't mind being the pain in the neck, because this is my community, and I love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2904.195s">I</a> served on this board for 36 years, and I have yet to see the Medford Police Department get what they really need, not only in more men and a new building, but a sense of priority here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2915.961s">And</a> when I compare that and I look and see the nonsense that's going on in the school department, praising the superintendent for whatever he's doing, which can't even compare to what the Smithford Police Department and the Smithford Fire Department does on a daily basis protecting this community and every single one of us in this room, that to me should be the priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2934.646s">And</a> if you really want to be strong about it, you would hold this mayor, Mayor Stephanie Burke, hold her feet to the ground and do not move on that budget until you get your answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2943.809s">for</a> more policemen and a new police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2946.411s">Be</a> happy to answer any questions if anybody has them. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2950.234s">Thank</a> you.

<a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4193.3s">Anything</a> that we've had a bond that can have an effect upon the people within this community, we are now saying, come on in, pay us for what you think you want to pay us, and we'll entertain it if not accept it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4206.285s">You</a> know, Councilman Marks made an interesting comment a few weeks ago when we had this discussion as it relates to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4211.467s">If</a> they're putting so much time into the bubble, I wish they would put more time into the educational process. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4215.632s">at</a> the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4216.932s">They</a> put a lot of time into hiring 5,000 administrators at over $95,000 a piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4221.053s">And</a> as a matter of fact, one of them was one who was terminated from one school, but hired back up at the high school at $95,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4229.035s">A</a> lot of interest, a lot of input went into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4232.735s">But</a> when we look at this, you have a definitely, you have a legal question here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4236.456s">And</a> I think this council voted, all seven of you voted to have a report back from the bond council. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4243.017s">From</a> the bond counsel who wrote this for the city of Medford, the legal question is, can the city of Medford rent or lease this piece of property to a private for-profit company and then charge back the city of Medford for its use of the same property that they have leased for a measly $75,000 a year? <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4264.163s">Because</a> that's all they give in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4266.144s">And</a> don't forget, if you're right, Councilor Marks, if it's a 10-year deal and the city gets the bond, <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4271.288s">It's</a> not costing these people anything, because they will write this off on a tax write-off for 10 years for its use, especially if it's a for-profit business. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4280.451s">And</a> what are we going to get at the very end as a community? <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4283.012s">Whatever</a> the repairs that are needed to take place are going to take place, and who's going to have to pay for the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4289.134s">These</a> are the type of questions that would be great ballot questions to put out there during a general election. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4295.396s">Because</a> if it's such a wonderful argument and a wonderful issue, the pros and cons of public hearings <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4301.487s">and</a> meetings at city council and at school committee meetings would serve the purpose of whether the people want this or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4308.192s">I</a> think if I had a student up at the high school right now, I would be more concerned on the educational quality of where that student needs to go or would like to go rather than arguing over a bubble that might have some not only logistical, legal questions, but would have questions over the fact that what are we doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4325.003s">Taxpayers'</a> money. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4327.024s">When</a> we as members of the Medford City Council voted for the science labs, <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4331.307s">for</a> the skating rink, for the swimming pool, and Edgeley Field. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4334.63s">We</a> were taking the taxpayers of Medford's money and the bond rating that we were getting at that particular time to purchase that piece of bond in behalf of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4345.058s">You're</a> not doing that now because what you're doing is you're abdicating the responsibility of the bond responsibility by the city and you're allowing an outside for-profit business to come in here, take advantage of it, <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4356.923s">and</a> pay the city a measly $75 an hour, $75,000 a year, while at the same time make thousands and hundreds and thousands of dollars over the life of the bubble. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4367.787s">That's</a> not good financing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4369.387s">That</a> doesn't make good sense to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4371.428s">And</a> I think this needs a lot more attention to the fact that you need all the legal questions asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4376.15s">And</a> I think you really need to compare this with this upcoming budget in the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4381.007s">It</a> makes a huge difference as it relates to where priorities are going. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4385.669s">We</a> just got through talking about public safety, policemen. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4388.109s">We</a> talked about a new police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4389.83s">Well,</a> you're talking now about a bubble. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4392.351s">And</a> before the bubble bursts on the city of Medford and you get stuck with a financial boondoggle, I think we need to say, let's slow down and let's really take a look and see what's going on, because that's what this is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4404.815s">It's</a> your money. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4405.715s">It's</a> our money. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4406.675s">It's</a> the city's money. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4407.936s">It's</a> everybody's money. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4409.373s">And</a> if we're going to allow a private for-profit business to come in and take advantage of our community and our real estate to the detriment of our city, for a measly $75,000, then you're really selling yourself short, and you're selling the taxpayers short. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4427.336s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_WjkcDsmFdD4/2025-03-21_WjkcDsmFdD4.html">Medford, MA City Council - May 10, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5151.586s">My</a> name is Robert Penter. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5152.526s">I</a> live at Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5154.547s">I'm</a> a member of the Saugus party. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5156.607s">My</a> take on this is just a little bit different. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5158.507s">We</a> can talk about the maintenance, and it's quite obvious that the maintenance is an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5162.128s">But</a> I'd like to get into the legality of the bond in and of itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5165.809s">When</a> the city of Medford went out for the bond in this particular field,
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5181.282s">Mr.</a> President, my purpose of saying the legality of it is because I would like to ask a question, and I think it needs to be answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5187.506s">The</a> question is very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5188.607s">The</a> City of Medford owns the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5190.808s">Now,</a> will the City of Medford own the dome that the renter wants to come in? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5195.511s">And</a> if that's the situation, I think it changes the whole intent of what the City of Medford's bond was all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5201.533s">and</a> that bond being for the exclusive use, again, of the fields, Medford folks and students first, and however the rentals take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5210.001s">But</a> you're now building a bond, and now you want to build a bubble, and the bubble will declare an ownership of authority of the person that has it, and the city of Medford will not have priority of the use of those fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5219.791s">So</a> I would hope one of you folks on the council would make that request to our city solicitor to ask him <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5226.18s">if</a> in fact this is even legal to do and what authority, if anything, does the city or will they have over the dome itself for the purposes of liability and for the purposes of its use? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5237.444s">I</a> think it's an important question to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5240.025s">I</a> have no problem with the bubble, whether it goes or doesn't go. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5242.906s">I</a> think you need to have this legal question as it relates to this particular matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5246.767s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5247.827s">So</a> I would hope somebody.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5285.706s">I'm</a> trying to clarify the motion, if you'd give me the courtesy. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5290.109s">Also,</a> the fact of the matter is, does this interfere with the bond that originally was written, therefore allowing, as such right now, the city of Medford entertaining a private entity to come in, use its field for its particular purpose, the dome? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5303.958s">I</a> think that question needs to be asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5306.639s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5310.382s">And</a> you can review that on tape, if you'd like.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7684.979s">My</a> name is Robert Pentez, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7687.88s">I'm</a> a member of this board. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7689.001s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Lungelkorn for bringing this up, but more importantly, I'd like to thank the squeaky wheel of South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7694.692s">and</a> threats, because she's been fighting this battle for five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7697.799s">And</a> for five years, as Councilor Caraviello said, some things have gotten better, some things have gotten worse, and some things haven't even been addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7704.521s">But</a> I want to pick up on the second part of your resolution, Councilor, where you indicate, and any other related issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7710.126s">In</a> early spring of this past year, when the city had its street-sweeping program, the City of Medford engaged in the South Medford area, as well as other parts of the city, in a tag-and-toe process. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7721.456s">And</a> then on April 29th, this immediate April 29th, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7725.392s">the</a> mayor of this community instructed the police department to stop tagging and towing as it relates to the street sweeping that was continuing on after that time to this day. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7734.155s">Now,</a> I don't know what the reason is for the stopping of the tagging and the towing, but anyone who got a ticket and was tagged and towed, as the gentleman who was here last week, they should get their money back. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7745.4s">Every</a> single person in this city who's been tagged and towed should get their money back because the mayor abruptly stopped on April 29th
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7789.128s">The</a> issue revolves more than Mr. Lester. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7790.669s">It</a> revolves around everyone else that received a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7793.932s">Subsequent</a> to April 29th, on a Friday, when the Police Department was informed by the Mayor not to give out any more ticket and tags, the Police Department still went down the street with the bullhorn, telling people the streets were going to be sweeped, but nobody was ticketed and tagged. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7807.042s">Now,</a> prior to that, during the early spring sweep, people were tagged.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7822.685s">It</a> is, and I spoke to the police department personally, and the Councilor can check himself if he so chooses. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7826.749s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Knight.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7830.932s">Well,</a> you have your contacts over there, and anyone who wants to refute what I'm saying, I'd be more than happy to apologize, but I'm not apologizing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7838.115s">The</a> fact of the matter is it did happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7839.836s">We've</a> had this discussion before as it relates to sweet streeping here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7844.998s">We</a> have our tax bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7846.979s">You</a> have your water and sewer tax bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7849.26s">Those</a> go out, and whether you're the homeowner or the business owner or you're the renter, it's up to the person who owns the property <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7856.16s">to</a> instruct the person who's either renting and the homeowner or the business person who's there in that particular street for whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7863.747s">If</a> it takes a year, and this is what we talked about almost four years ago, if it takes a year to get into a street signage program where all the streets in this community are signed and everybody becomes aware of it, we won't have to talk about <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7876.12s">posting</a> papers on a tree, or stapling them on whatever you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7879.923s">You</a> have many opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7881.605s">If</a> you had public access here in this community, you'd be able to see it, but we don't have that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7897.019s">It</a> may be the same issues, but still nothing seems to be happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7899.63s">And</a> unfortunately, a whole host of individuals have been tagged and towed needlessly because, in fact, they may have changed their mind, maybe because of the complaints, and that's all well and good. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7909.256s">But</a> if you don't have a stationary in-house program that's consistent, you can't pick on one week and then cancel it on another. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7917.06s">So</a> I would recommend to anyone who received a ticket prior to April 29, was tagged and towed, go to City Hall and demand, because this administration stopped it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7927.426s">Can</a> I finish, please, without you being so rude? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7930.267s">Is</a> it possible that you can for once in your life just stand there and be decent when I'm at this podium? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7940.21s">That's</a> my recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7941.431s">I</a> would hope the council in some shape, manner or form consults with the administration, asks them for the purposes of <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7948.247s">Let</a> this year go by, it's a big mistake that took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7951.528s">Why,</a> in fact, they stopped on April 29th, why the police department no longer is tagging and towing for street sweeping, I don't know, but it's the mayor of this community right now that's done that, and anyone that's gotten the ticket prior to that, unfortunately, doesn't have any recourse unless they get some recourse from City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7968.593s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_nXRer8wKd5o/2025-03-21_nXRer8wKd5o.html">Medford, MA City Council - Apr. 19, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4648.744s">Regarding</a> public access here in the city of Medford, we are at the repeating stage once again. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4653.928s">Since</a> early 2013 to date, we, the Comcast and Verizon cable subscribers, have been charged the monthly public access fee totaling some $500,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4663.776s">And</a> we, the subscribers, still have no public access station. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4669.161s">What</a> we heard from 2013 by the

Channel 3 Public Access Corporation, because then at that point in time, Channel 3 Corporation was filing for dissolution of its Chapter 3 Corporation. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4689.005s">Records</a> of expenditures of gasoline, restaurants, retail, supermarkets, hardware home suppliers, plumbing and air conditioning materials, building materials, auto supplies, <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4701.128s">Miscellaneous</a> expenses in bank and ATM withdrawals, along with deposits and credits from the banks in the accounting were examples that were supposed to have been forwarded to the city of Medford pursuant to the dissolution filing. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4714.412s">As</a> of this date, no accounting of any records, bank statements, meeting minutes, or accurate inventory accounting has ever been verified from channel three. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4724.355s">Regarding</a> the city's lack of providing public access TV, <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4728.358s">The</a> ever-going question since 2013 has been, why has the city failed to mandate that public access be made available as contractually applied for? <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4738.805s">Fast</a> forward to today, and putting aside all the comments and issue regarding the forced ascertainment hearing, the former mayor's commission report regarding public cable access, and multiple council resolutions regarding this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4755.193s">It</a> seems that this administration feels that to spend some $500,000 for an access studio up in the back of Medford High School will serve in the best interest of a local public access station. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4767.221s">I</a> don't believe this to be in the best interest of our subscribers and citizens, and for the following reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4773.525s">It's</a> location, location, location that is the primary success staple of any business. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4780.35s">The</a> Medford High location will not serve the best interest for our public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4785.341s">Examples</a> as to why. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4787.181s">Its</a> public access is not on a main street that is centrally located. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4792.963s">The</a> entranceway is not well lit. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4795.023s">It</a> is not easily accessible to walk up and to walk back the hill from the back to and from Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4803.025s">It</a> presents a winter problem of ice and snow needing to be cleared at all times on the hill and the walkway to the school's back entrance. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4810.947s">It</a> presents a safety security problem for after school hours <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4814.88s">and</a> nighttime lighting is at a minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4818.002s">As</a> a major positive contrast to the Medford High location, the Medford Public Library serves as the best location for public access studio. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4827.326s">It</a> is centrally located within our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4829.887s">It</a> has walking convenience within the city's downtown area and bus routes. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4834.53s">It</a> is handicap accessible to being easily available for front door entrance for bus and cab transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4842.088s">It</a> offers a great additional public educational opportunity for community public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4848.252s">Medford's</a> $500,000 bank deposits from Comcast and Verizon thus far will definitely produce at the library the space needs necessary for this development. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4859.84s">As</a> Councilor Caraviello has indicated by requesting the Massachusetts State Library Commission come to Medford to ascertain what state additional funding can be for the library to Ghana for the library's rehabilitation, <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4871.903s">That,</a> along with what I proposed last year during the Mayor's campaign to have a complaint present use and future use, along with the $500,000 funds that are readily available right now here in City Hall, could catapult the Medford Public Library to being Medford's premier central educational and social meeting spot that incorporates an entire community of opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4894.069s">This</a> would be the perfect segue for having <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4896.987s">The</a> Massachusetts State Library Commission realized that we are working to make our library a major focal point in our city, and their additional support position would certainly carry us to that potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4909.972s">It</a> would be an example of how a city fully realizes the community potential of its public library. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4916.575s">To</a> my understanding and education thus far, this would be a first for the Massachusetts State Library Commission to co-invest with a city with matching funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4926.403s">The</a> Medford Vocational School location, as is presently being entertained, could be a satellite location for students' learning of production and access operations as a school program offering separate and distinct from the public access studio. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4941.947s">This</a> opportunity for community public access to be better located and more readily available should not be squandered away because of political posturing. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4951.529s">Mayor</a> McGlynn's own committee report of June 2015 specifically stated, <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4957.305s">We</a> are a committee that feels that the best location will be in one that is conveniently and centrally located with its own entrance and exit and should be handicap accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4967.751s">The</a> Method Public Library could serve no better location than the one that has been advised for. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4974.595s">Also,</a> with the city owning the property, annual rental payments will not have to be provided. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4980.239s">Therefore,</a> providing for more revenue to maintain, upgrade equipment, <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4984.355s">and</a> conveniently offer to the community programs that showcase our city and the families and subscribers that watch and use public access TV. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4993.638s">I</a> respectfully ask that this honorable body of councilors request by a roll call vote that our city administration reconsider its position regarding public access to TV being at Medford High School and entertain the Medford Public Library as the location that will better serve our community in the Comcast and variable cable rate payers <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5013.732s">for</a> paying for their public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5026.477s">Well,</a> I have a question that I presented before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5029.158s">I</a> was just wondering if anyone would entertain that because I think this is a very important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5033.7s">It's</a> a lot of money and I think it offers a great opportunity.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5825.044s">All</a> set? <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5828.372s">Mr.</a> President, as just a point of reference, for the last six years, prior to last year, don't forget the city of Medford got waivers from the Mass Department, State Department of Library Commissioners, because the city did not put enough money in there when, in fact, they did have the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5840.438s">But</a> putting that aside, with all due respect to Councilor Knight, if you look at the Mass Department of Education, cable, public access, and the teaching of public access is an allowable educational product here in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5855.217s">It</a> can't be a deed restriction, or even, I don't know what the deed restriction can be, because the library is an educational thing, and the public access is educational. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5862.5s">It</a> works hand in hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5863.84s">And</a> as I indicated earlier, what Councilor Caraviello might have met and talked to those folks from the state, they've never had a co-investing partner like the City of Medford would have. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5873.904s">And</a> if we could upgrade not only the building, the roof, the second floor, whatever needs to be done with the $500,000 that the city has at the present time, and moving that forward, having a full public access, <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5884.083s">here,</a> right here in the city of Medford, centrally located, that would help to expedite. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5888.604s">If</a> the administration was serious about the public library, as was a campaign issue during this past year, we wouldn't have to worry about 140 pages being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5897.626s">You'd</a> go out and hire someone ASAP and make that presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5901.027s">And</a> if they knew that the city of Medford was willing to invest its money instead of asking for all of the money from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the board of library commissioners, it's the first of its kind. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5911.178s">And</a> I think they would be more receptive to that than just the plain grant application. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5915.46s">I</a> don't see any what the problem would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5917.241s">Because</a> if we want to move this thing forward, we have the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5920.923s">It</a> isn't like we don't have the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5923.084s">We're</a> not offering the service that's contractually been obligated for through Verizon and Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5929.287s">You</a> do not have public access here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5932.788s">And</a> we can go back to resolutions from 2013 bringing forward <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5936.44s">where</a> the votes have been seven to nothing on this council floor to go forward and find out what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5942.243s">You</a> can't even get the records back from the former Cable 3, the Channel 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5946.926s">We</a> don't even know if they've actually been formally dissolved by the Karma of the Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5950.788s">They</a> could still be in operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5952.93s">Nobody</a> knows nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5953.85s">We</a> haven't received anything back. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5955.851s">But</a> the onus of responsibility, with all due respect, Mr. President, right now can come from this council, because I think you're all on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5962.582s">you</a> want to see something done. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5964.302s">And</a> to find out that they're doing some work now up at that school, and this council not even being notified or entertained about it, that doesn't speak well about transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5974.904s">They</a> can do all the restructuring up there they want and do it for another purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5979.045s">This</a> is more important. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5980.525s">How</a> and where public access is going to go, how the $500,000 is going to go, how it's going to be centrally located, and how it can be immersed into this community <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5988.775s">as</a> an educational product, ready, willing, and able to go locally, not segued in a certain part of this community that has too many obstacles to make the thing work. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5998.999s">Thank</a> you very much.<h2><a

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=1256.547s">My</a> name is Robert Penter. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=1257.608s">I</a> live at Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of the Saugus party. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=1261.408s">I</a> was on the Medford City Council on the year that this transfer did take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=1266.049s">It</a> was a very emotionally impact situation at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=1269.51s">Folks</a> that had certain disabilities were very excited over the fact that this opportunity would present itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=1276.071s">But</a> the fact of the matter is since the property has not been used, I believe for the last two years for the purposes so stated back in 1991, <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=1283.51s">I</a> believe, Mr. Solicitor, it would indicate that it possibly would revert back to the City of Method because of its non-use. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=1290.674s">And</a> Bridgewell really has no opportunity to say to the City of Method, you have to buy it back from us to negotiate because, in fact, it was the Heckner Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=1299.198s">Whatever</a> the agreement, the handshake was between the Heckner Center and Bridgewell, that came after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=1303.861s">It</a> continued on, so to speak, as the educational nonprofit entity. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=1308.823s">But</a> when they stopped using the property at that location, I believe, <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=1312.875s">The</a> council vote and the record will reflect that once it's no longer used for that purpose, it remains as a city of Medford piece of property.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=1320.518s">Sure.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=1369.14s">But</a> I believe the legal action was predicated upon the city of Medford and the Hegner Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=1372.883s">And</a> what they did after that became subsequent to the original intent of the council.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=2955.829s">Robert</a> Penta, Zero Summit Road, and I've been masked. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=2958.33s">I'm</a> a member of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=2959.71s">One</a> of the things I think you really need to be concerned about is the annual report that just came out by Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=2964.955s">They</a> indicated that they did just a little bit over a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=2967.956s">Their</a> intention was to do about a million eight for their first year. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=2971.256s">Now</a> they're blaming a bad winter, they're blaming the Kratik Bridge, they're blaming a whole host of other issues as to why they didn't receive that and generate the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=2979.558s">If</a> that doesn't tell you that they're going to go on a very aggressive ticketing here in the city of Medford, something is going to tell you that, because they're not going to be out here not to make money. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=2991.327s">You</a> know, the fact of the matter is that we only got $30,000 this year from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=2995.568s">I</a> believe we're getting another $230,000 from fines and we're getting another $250,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3000.269s">Um,</a> on the, it's an annual payment. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3003.109s">It's</a> not a one time annual thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3005.03s">It's</a> $250,000 annually. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3006.81s">That's</a> supposed to go back to the cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3008.93s">So</a> that probably only generated about $560,000 here to the city of Medford for this past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3014.111s">But</a> that included fines and that included the two 50. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3017.072s">So</a> the actual, <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3018.751s">Revenue</a> was only $30,000 because they never even got anywheres near the million eight It wasn't supposed to be a revenue enhancer, but the present mayor calls it a revenue turnover I I don't know how it's a revenue turnover if it's not a revenue enhancer Because if you're turning over more cars allegedly people are going to take the spots and pay more money no matter how you look at it It's a revenue enhancer Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3043.121s">We</a> can go back to 2009 when the report was submitted here <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3046.43s">which</a> you and the chief and other members of this community served upon it, and you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3050.313s">The</a> first thing was to have revenue traffic enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3054.877s">And</a> on the last page, the priority of the committee was to have single head meters or double head meters, you know, throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3061.863s">That</a> was the easiest and common sense way for people to understand what they would have to pay for when they're parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3067.888s">And</a> we don't see that right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3069.709s">And</a> I think if you just continue to go on and you realize, <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3073.087s">that</a> if you're going to change the contract, the contract is very specific as it states. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3077.89s">If</a> any changes to the kiosk take place, the city of Medford has to pay for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3081.812s">So</a> whether you buy these doublehead or singlehead meters, it's going to have to be negotiated. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3087.675s">I</a> know your city solicitor is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3089.256s">It's</a> going to have to be negotiated too. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3090.856s">But</a> the fact of the matter is, they didn't get anywhere near the $1 million that they were looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3095.459s">So</a> you're going to probably see a very aggressive movement right now by Republic as it relates to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3101.875s">Let</a> me tell you an experience I had this afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3103.656s">I</a> was in Medford Square with one of the people from Republic, a gentleman who was very kind and very courteous. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3108.759s">And</a> he watched two particular people, one gentleman in particular, who parked his car maybe six cars away from the kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3116.322s">He</a> drove by, didn't even see the kiosk, and just went along his way. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3120.004s">He</a> was stopped, and he was told he had to put the money in the kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3122.306s">He</a> said he didn't even know. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3123.866s">And</a> if you have an SUV or other type of vehicle that's there, when you're driving by and you don't see it, and if you don't come from the city of Medford and you don't see it, <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3131.224s">You</a> know, you're just going to be subject to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3133.026s">And</a> another one was, somebody just mentioned it, I think Mr. Capucci, if the screen is very light and you can't read it and you can't see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3140.572s">I</a> think it was you, Councilor Caraviello, who brought this up way back in January of 2015 as one of the first arguments that you had against Republic was the fact that the matter of these kiosks were very hard to read, especially when the sun is hitting on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3153.264s">And</a> if you're a senior citizen, it's making it even worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3156.553s">There's</a> a cost factor that the republic is going to have to address and it should not be on the city side. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3161.396s">But</a> I would, if in fact you have to go forward any further with this whole program for which I would be totally opposed to, I believe the meters would be a better way of representing common sense to a person having to park and having to put money in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3176.505s">But</a> more importantly, I think the city can find itself in a negotiating point as it relates to where they would want to go with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3182.909s">Remember</a> that $250,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3185.312s">by</a> Mayor McGlynn, former Mayor McGlynn, was very specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3188.295s">It</a> was to be used specifically for the business districts here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3193.92s">And</a> to use it for any other purpose for which would serve hopefully a better purpose for people in the business districts, I think that's gonna have to be a negotiated tool.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=5946.555s">Robert</a> Pentz, Zero Summit Road, Medford Mass, former colleague of this August body. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=5952.079s">On</a> January 29th of this past year, Republic met with the mayor of this community as it relates to certain parking issues that have been going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=5959.003s">But</a> I would just like to revert back to July 23rd of 2015, when the local press, the mayor at that time who was running, had sent in a press release indicating that there were 12 things <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=5972.347s">that</a> she would like to see take place as it relates to Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=5976.77s">And</a> the request at that time was to have it done immediately, not in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=5981.853s">And</a> we're still waiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=5983.594s">But</a> she updated that on August 23rd of this past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=5989.217s">And</a> what she updated, strike that, on August 30th of this past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=5992.659s">And</a> what she updated was another press release. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=5995.161s">And</a> she also sent out a survey to the peoples of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=5999.604s">And</a> the survey was particular, in one particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6002.182s">Question</a> number one, would you be supportive of exempting senior citizens from having to pay to park in the city of Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6009.166s">I</a> believe our seniors should not have to encounter any frustration in their daily lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6014.349s">And</a> that's part of the base commentary. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6017.091s">And</a> on the second page of the survey, there were four questions, and the very first one was, do you think senior citizens should be exempt from paying or parking at kiosks and meters? <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6027.177s">And</a> I believe it was October 23rd, and the debate that we had <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6031.992s">She</a> publicly announced, once again, seniors should not have to pay, and she was making that a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6038.654s">This</a> is now September 20th, I mean, strike that, March 23rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6043.116s">This</a> is a huge issue, because no matter where I go walking around this city, and I'm quite sure members of this council have heard the same thing, you know, the seniors of this community believe that they're going to be entitled to this discount. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6055.06s">It</a> was a campaign issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6056.12s">It</a> was a campaign promise. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6058.121s">It</a> was a campaign press release. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6060.242s">It</a> was a double-headed story. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6061.706s">And</a> it was a survey they went out. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6063.687s">I</a> believe, in all honesty, if you're going to make promises such as this, you need to honor them. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6068.93s">If</a> not, have a discussion as to why not. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6071.531s">I</a> don't think this council has had any discussion with the mayor and with Republic as it relates to any of the 12 issues that were reported on July 23rd in the local paper and on August 30th, as was presented by then-candidate Mayor Burke, as she is now, Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6089.772s">I</a> just think it's too important of an issue, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6104.315s">I'm</a> just alluding to the fact that this is what I'm hearing more and more as I'm walking the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6108.355s">Give</a> the mayor an opportunity sometime, I have no problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6111.516s">But</a> the fact of the matter is there's nothing on the table that even talks about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6114.676s">That</a> was the number one question in the survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6117.077s">It</a> was the number one comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6119.044s">and</a> the press release. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6120.425s">And</a> when you lead with something like that, and you're leading people to believe that this is what it's about, and thinking there's a rainy day that's going to go away with some sunshine for seniors, we don't even know if it's going to be 55, 62, 65. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6132.493s">I</a> don't know what the number is, but whatever it is, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6136.116s">It's</a> for the senior citizens of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6139.258s">And</a> with that being said, I would hope one member of the council, if not the council in general, would basically make the request of the mayor, if in fact she is going to honor that pledge, <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6148.123s">of</a> granting senior citizens a discount. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6150.785s">And</a> when you people have your meeting with her, that as well as the other 12 things that were outlined on July 23rd in the local press, which still haven't come to fruition, need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6161.634s">You</a> know, we all ran for politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6164.136s">Some</a> of us win, some of us lose. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6166.118s">But</a> you have to stand by what you're running on and the principles of what you're running on and the comments that you're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6172.583s">And</a> they just can't be there for the sake of being political and making political hay <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6177.04s">It's</a> just appeasing the people that you're talking to. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6181.141s">They've</a> met January 29th. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6182.361s">It's</a> obvious that you guys have no idea, and ladies, no idea what took place on January 29th. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6188.363s">You</a> don't know what the discussions have been. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6190.284s">It's</a> obvious that something is going on that you're not aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6193.825s">Councilor</a> Caraviello, I think the conversation that we had a few weeks ago, you haven't even gotten an update to the financial question that you asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6202.587s">Part</a> of the attachment that you never got, so they're just keeping you in limbo. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6206.291s">whatever</a> it might be, I would just hope, and I would ask one of my colleagues, one of my colleagues that are presently here, if they would put that in the form of a motion for a report to get an answer back on, because I think it's in all fairness to all the seniors in this community, it was a major campaign issue, and it still hasn't been addressed.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6240.92s">Well,</a> Mr. President, let me ask you a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6242.681s">How</a> could that be determined when that issue has not even been brought up? <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6246.182s">You've</a> had other financial issues brought up, but you haven't had the issues of the senior citizen parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6251.184s">It's</a> separate and distinct unto itself.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6281.308s">I</a> beg to disagree with you, Council President DelaRosa. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6284.15s">There's</a> nothing in the records that even reflect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6286.492s">I'm</a> making that as a public request right now to have that as part of the official agenda when you folks meet.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_acqgxK4yhEM/2025-03-21_acqgxK4yhEM.html">Medford, MA City Council - Feb. 16, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=805.599s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=809.141s">My</a> name is Robert Pater. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=810.461s">I</a> live at Zero Summit Road, a former member of the Zargas Party. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=813.903s">First</a> of all, to answer your question, Councilor De La Ruzo, Council President De La Ruzo, the Board of Appeals received a letter from Tufts University through their developers that they have rejected, and they're not going forward with the purchase of the sale of the piece of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=826.723s">And</a> I would hope it's because at the board of appeals meeting on the night that it took place, there wasn't one person that was there for it from the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=832.985s">As</a> a matter of fact, they were all against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=834.786s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=835.646s">Number</a> two, I think the city of Medford has a responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=838.747s">If</a> in fact they do believe in keeping its history and a piece of its history, here's a classic opportunity for them to engage in this particular part. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=846.39s">The</a> method historical commission only has $700 a year in its budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=850.111s">It's</a> a pittance as compared to what the value of properties are here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=854.331s">And</a> right around the corner, with the demolition delay permit hanging on them, you have another piece of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=860.153s">It's</a> called the Cabernet House. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=861.414s">It's</a> a French colony house. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=862.975s">And</a> that's due any day now to come up as an issue of whether it's going to be destroyed with a present purchase for value being a contractor. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=870.658s">You</a> know, when you talk about history here in the city of Medford, it isn't that it's on Toroweb or South Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=876.443s">It's</a> who owns the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=878.244s">At</a> Tufts University, with a billion-dollar endowment, not a million or a hundred million, a billion-dollar endowment, there is no need right now for them to have this piece of property to be sold. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=891.033s">Now,</a> they're getting a little bit tricky with this, because what they're trying to do is sell the property last week on Zillow, advertising it, and then they subsequently changed the language, not to say that it could be subdivided. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=903.982s">It's</a> just a single-house piece of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=906.545s">Now,</a> the single home historical district, that's the terminology that needs to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=911.489s">That's</a> what puts the preservation restriction on this piece of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=915.793s">And</a> Tufts University, if they want to really be the good neighbor, they can come up to the plate. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=919.716s">They</a> have two good bites of the apple of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=922.118s">They</a> can lead on this one here if they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=923.86s">They</a> can make the application to the Commonwealth of Mass, for which there is a pamphlet that tells you that it's called There is a Difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=930.786s">It's</a> all from the Mass Historical Society. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=933.94s">establishing</a> historical districts, there's a dish they have out on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=938.002s">What</a> they could do, they could go forward and make this application in behalf of preserving the piece of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=943.385s">Or</a> in the alternative, what they could do, they could place a restriction on their deed. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=948.287s">So</a> any subsequent for value who purchases that, which would be the next person for value, there would be a deed restriction that would be recorded at the Middlesex South Registry of Deeds in perpetuity, which means <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=959.57s">it</a> could never be subdivided. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=961.351s">The</a> house and the land stays as one. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=964.274s">And</a> that's all that the neighbors are looking for, to preserve their neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=968.437s">Because</a> if that does get itself subdivided and other houses go there, you will have an increase in parking, you will have an increase of traffic in the neighborhood for which they don't need at the present time. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=979.225s">As</a> members of the Medford City Council, I believe you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=981.567s">If</a> you really believe in history and preserving it and keeping it as a part of what the city of Medford's all about, <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=987.002s">You</a> do have a responsibility, and I would probably suggest and ask that you fellows and ladies make a pitch to the Medford Historical Commission to support the residents and the abutters and the people of Medford who want to keep this house as an historical piece of property and for the city of Medford to file with the Commonwealth of Mass Historical Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1008.602s">If</a> in fact Tufts University won't do it, in either way, <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1011.693s">to</a> preserve this as a historical landmark here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1016.056s">You</a> know, Tufts University, this isn't like new to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1018.958s">They</a> just got through doing this on grandfather's house on South Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1023.021s">And</a> fortunately, on this piece of property, the residents are aware, they're smart enough, and they now realize what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1029.546s">That</a> didn't happen on South Street, unfortunately. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1031.828s">That</a> happened in the summertime. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1033.549s">This</a> one here is a little bit more advanced where the neighborhood was aware of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1037.252s">And</a> also, if you go to the last meeting and one of the meeting minutes of the historical commission, <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1042.305s">the</a> meetings of October 29th, 2015, what was presented that time to Tufts University that they would go forward and sell the property with the request of maintaining a historical piece of property, but not to disallow them to subdivide it. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1056.795s">And</a> at that point in time, the developer and Tufts was not going to agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1063.48s">It</a> doesn't cost a lot of money to make this filing of this application. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1067.943s">And</a> what you're doing is you're preserving <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1069.925s">something</a> that the city has had. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1071.066s">If</a> anybody knows the history of that property, it goes way back, way before 1840. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1075.327s">It</a> goes back to two brothers that owned that piece of property, who were involved not only in shipbuilding, but were also involved in marketing, you know, internationally. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1085.132s">And</a> as the lady who just came and spoke before us, there are other houses on South Street that don't have an historical designation, and if they lose it, and somebody comes in and buys it, nobody's going to be able to do anything about it, because that's going to be their right to do it, whoever buys it to subdivide it. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1099.815s">Taking</a> all of this into consideration, and you might be asking, why are we here tonight? <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1103.398s">You're</a> here tonight for one reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1105.48s">The</a> Historical Commission hopefully will have a meeting, because they've been asked to have an emergency meeting, to put a stop to this and have Tufts University put a stop to this, or become a partner so it doesn't get itself subdivided in any shape, manner, or form. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1119.071s">Tufts</a> University could sell that property today for a million dollars for whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1123.314s">The</a> purchase of a value will give Tufts University the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1126.017s">They'll</a> make their money. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1126.797s">It</a> doesn't make any difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1128.33s">But</a> to have it with the condition of being subdivided, the question is, I don't believe Tussel's going to get any money back, so why would you want to give an outside developer an opportunity to make that money at the expense of the neighborhood, at the expense of the citizens of Medford, and at the expense of our city's history? <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1143.574s">It</a> doesn't make any difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1145.014s">I</a> believe that there are plenty of people out there who would love to buy that house, live in that house knowing it's a piece of Medford, it's a piece of history, <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1152.535s">and</a> enjoy the land that's around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1154.356s">It's</a> a unique opportunity that many homes in this community doesn't even have that opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1159.819s">With</a> that being said, I would hope that somebody would be rational enough to realize that these folks aren't here, you know, on a lock. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1167.343s">They're</a> here on a mission, and the mission is to employ you as our elected officials to look into this and be a positive and affirmative backer for their position to keep Medford's history alive and well and not to have it deteriorated into a subdivision <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1181.689s">to</a> be sold off to a developer, for that developer to make money, and again, we lose another piece of Medford's history. <a

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1337.769s">The</a> fastest they probably think it could be completed by would be within six to seven months, if that would be the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1342.833s">The</a> quickest and the easiest way to do it would be to have Tufts University, they themselves, recognizing the fact that the neighbors don't want the property subdivided, they could just put an addendum or an attachment to the deed. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1353.982s">And</a> while this is taking place, if it takes more than six months to sell the property, the attachments on the deed, it's duly recorded, it's a done deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1360.327s">And</a> at the same time, the city will have its opportunity to not only do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1364.17s">You</a> bring up a good question. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1365.444s">Because</a> don't let it just be this house. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1367.266s">It's</a> all the houses in this, all the historic pieces of property in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1370.568s">And</a> it should be something that should be looked at because I don't think you're going to want to deal with this one at a time, maybe every other month or every third or fourth month. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1377.154s">I</a> think it's time that the city either takes a real hard look at what it has for its history and its properties and its values and put it all together so you don't have to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1385.481s">But</a> to answer your question, six, seven months.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1959.008s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1960.489s">Two</a> points. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1961.13s">The</a> president of Tufts university, Walnut Hill royalty, Ian Barber-Rubel, who's the public, they're well aware of what you're talking about, about the restriction. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1968.695s">So</a> the ball is well in their court and they've had this information for well over a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1971.958s">Um,</a> and I, I just think that's important to note. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1974.6s">And</a> I, and I think the strength of a roll call vote by the council would be apropos at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1980.625s">Sorry,</a> I upset your apple cart, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7425.654s">My</a> name is Robert Penter. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7426.514s">I</a> live at Zero Summit Road, a former member of this board. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7429.896s">Quick</a> correction. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7432.378s">I</a> was a member of the Fire Charter Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7435.983s">And</a> that Charter Commission was a nine-member board at that time, duly authorized by state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7440.305s">So</a> if it's seven now, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7442.686s">That</a> might have to be checked into. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7444.186s">But</a> one of the things, we had a book that was submitted at that time regarding the Charter Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7450.348s">And</a> it had to be submitted with the majority and a minority report. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7453.409s">It</a> had to be resubmitted to the Medford City Council then at that time, and they had to vote it up or down. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7457.871s">And</a> at that time, and I know the issues were five, <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7460.742s">But</a> there were eight things on the ballot question that was incorporated in the ballot summary. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7465.723s">And</a> in that ballot summary in the book, it not only included the majority report, it included the minority report. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7471.645s">But</a> I want to read one thing that's very important that should be an exact distinction that everybody knows what this charter commission can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7478.447s">We</a> held at that point in time, 25 committee meetings and six public hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7484.608s">And</a> it was all relegated around the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7487.169s">It</a> says, <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7491.218s">The</a> one line over here, notice of such public hearings shall be by public, oh wait a minute, not publication. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7496.563s">It</a> was over here, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7498.184s">The</a> commission believes that although additional time and repetitive debate was the necessary consequences of such action, the commission and the citizens affected by the recommendations required such courtesies. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7510.295s">At</a> that point in time, we were allotted, and again, by state statute, I don't know if it still allows, a legal representative, which would be an attorney at that point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7519.23s">We</a> engaged someone who was a professional in the area of charter commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7523.292s">I</a> think I agree with the folks who believe, whether it be the call-in center or anyone else like that, their recommendations cannot bode the same as Medford citizens who would come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7533.977s">The</a> legal person, the legal expertise would take the thoughts and recommendations and put it into the legalese of being in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7543.322s">One</a> other question I need to ask you, Councilor Marks, and I thank you for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7547.684s">You</a> used the word appointed. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7549.873s">And</a> I'm assuming you mean elected in December, I mean in November, if that's the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7558.52s">Cause</a> that, that's a huge distinction in terminology.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7618.759s">The</a> unfortunate part, and there was a couple of meetings that were held at the public library as it relates to the reviews. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7624.044s">The</a> reviews could only become operative if and when <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7627.439s">It's</a> presented as a charter commission update to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7630.922s">You</a> can have all the reviews you want, but to have it cast in stone three, four or five years, it would be a mandate that would be included. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7637.607s">That</a> was one of the terminologies that we try to get into the budget, I mean, into the charter back in 1987, prior to the 1987. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7644.612s">Unfortunately,</a> the majority of the members on the board didn't buy into it for whatever the reasons were back then. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7649.896s">There</a> were a whole host of things that were discussed that what Councilors, you know, having the city auditor come under the control of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7657.234s">because</a> that was a miscue that wasn't found in the legislation. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7659.935s">And</a> let me tell you, the law as it's presently written has some grammatical mistakes in it, too, that are just starting to surface now. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7669.319s">So</a> this is not going to be just like a very easy task. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7672.32s">We</a> went through every single word, every single sentence, the spelling, and the proper pronunciation. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7679.207s">in</a> grammatical corrections, excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7682.768s">This</a> is going to take a long time because it's been 33 years and there's a lot of changes that have taken place from 1977 when this first charter commission started by signatures from the street and finally got itself approved back in 1985 on the election ballot, 1986 it became operative with state statute. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7699.495s">So</a> I would strongly suggest that the more multiple meetings that you have, the better it's going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7705.239s">And</a> even if somebody wants to repeat themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7707.561s">And</a> I'll tell you, one of the classic things that took place during our charter meetings were the idea that we could change our minds because of the input that people brought. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7716.147s">And</a> the input that people brought could sometimes change your mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7719.31s">You</a> become so stereotyped through the years because you never had this opportunity to hear somebody else speak or what their ideas might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7726.135s">Yeah,</a> 30 years is a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7727.736s">Some</a> things maybe do stay the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7729.519s">Maybe</a> some things have changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7731.24s">But</a> to go forward with change, you have to be willing to adapt and recognize it. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7736.642s">Yesterday</a> just doesn't work today. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7738.243s">Or</a> maybe some of the things of yesterday are just as good as they are today. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7742.225s">You</a> need to get — if this is really going to be successful, you need to have as many meetings open and notorious to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7748.407s">We</a> had 25 committee meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7750.448s">We</a> had six public hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7752.089s">And</a> you couldn't ask for more than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7753.91s">We</a> had a majority of — there was a nine-member board. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7756.591s">The</a> final vote was six to three. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7758.392s">Doesn't</a> make any difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7759.8s">The</a> law allows you to have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7762.262s">The</a> taxpayers of this community got the booklet, majority, minority report. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7765.806s">They</a> got the question in front with all the addendums, the adding and the subtractions to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7770.384s">That's</a> the game plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7771.545s">It's</a> going to take an awful lot of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7773.667s">So</a> I just would strongly suggest that while you're taking this first step and going forward, you've got to keep an open mind to every single possibility that you would want to do with this plan A form of government. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7785.578s">And</a> if you're getting a pushback that other people might say, we should review all forms of government, you have to entertain that because that's what a charter review is about. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7793.525s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9684.953s">Mr.</a> President, two quick comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9686.194s">Barpenta</a> zero summit road farmer member. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9688.913s">You</a> know, I'm standing on this side of the rail, and I feel somewhat vindicated, because when I sat over there, I was watching the same thing people accused me of what took place here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9698.659s">I</a> don't know if it's this. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9700.22s">Maybe</a> it's the seat, George. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9701.421s">It</a> could be the seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9703.182s">I</a> don't know, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9704.923s">But</a> again, refreshing my memory, going back when we did this, we had conversations like this way back when. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9713.453s">when</a> people would come from the audience when they were talking about childhood change. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9716.695s">Now,</a> we had big issues back then. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9718.556s">It</a> was the former city manager at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9720.938s">He</a> was one of the issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9721.858s">And</a> the other one was taking over the police department, having a police commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9725.521s">That</a> stirred the pot within the city of Medford at that point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9728.403s">And</a> that's the reason why the signatures went out. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9730.564s">I'm</a> going to disagree with you, Janie. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9732.025s">I</a> think signatures or this route, either route works, depending. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9736.648s">And</a> they're both legal. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9737.548s">So</a> you can't say that they don't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9740.445s">I</a> would support Council Mark's proposition of having a Committee of the Whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9744.407s">And</a> Mr. President, even though it's a resolution to have the City of Sicily draft a proposal, in this proposal there are ingredients. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9754.211s">And</a> I'm assuming that's what the Committee of the Whole will elicit from the people who will come to the podium, talk about what the ingredients might be, and that's the beginning of getting this process going. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9765.216s">Passion</a> ran very deep here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9767.973s">But</a> don't let it interfere with the eye on the prize. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9772.176s">And</a> the eye on the prize is making sure that the people of the city have an opportunity to review this charter as many ways as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9780.481s">And</a> they're afforded that opportunity to talk about it, to discuss it, and vote on it as many times as need be before the final product is presented to the taxpayers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9790.508s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10584.189s">Mr.</a> President, my name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, former member of this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10589.991s">Last</a> Tuesday night, along with myself and other taxpayers who came up before this podium, <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10595.678s">The</a> resolution that was introduced by Councilor Lungo-Koehn found itself in a libelous rebuttal by our superintendent, Mr. Belson, where he not only attacked Councilor Lungo-Koehn, Councilor Marks, myself, and resident citizens who came before this podium to express their freedom of speech rights, <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10614.82s">as</a> it relates to what's going on at Medford High School regarding a bomb threat. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10618.724s">As</a> Councilor Lungo-Koehn just alluded to, when a bomb threat takes place between 8 and 9 in the morning and parents aren't told until around 6 o'clock at night, that's an 8 to 9 hour spread. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10628.673s">The</a> lack of communication was huge there. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10631.576s">And</a> we were led to believe that protocols were in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10634.398s">And</a> I think it was you, Councilor Scalpelli, along with Councilor Falco, <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10637.421s">who</a> indicated that you worked on a protocol procedure, and you were going to check it out the next night to make sure and to ensure the protocol was kept. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10645.004s">Now</a> we're finding out that something is being manufactured, and it'll be ready sometime in March as it relates to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10651.807s">The</a> interesting part about that, in his libelous commentary that he wrote, he indicated that we were instilling fear within this community because we were here talking about this bomb that took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10662.411s">And</a> I think it was Mr. Candy, in his comment in return, <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10666.013s">for</a> which he's re-quoted, he stated, you create fear when you don't inform the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10671.036s">And</a> that's what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10671.817s">They</a> didn't get informed for almost eight to nine hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10675.059s">There</a> wasn't a lockdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10676.04s">There</a> was nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10677.101s">No</a> student, no teacher knew that there was a bomb threat that took place in that school, whether it was high level, low level, or big level, for whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10687.067s">You</a> know, the same situation took place at Everett last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10690.77s">And</a> the same problem existed, a lack of communication, <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10694.248s">between</a> the school administration to the parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10697.569s">And</a> because of that, you just can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10702.73s">The</a> superintendent should not be the sole provider of alleging that he can take care of the kids in that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10709.911s">You</a> can't relay that commentary back to every single parent in that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10714.512s">That's</a> not right, it's not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10716.072s">If</a> it was his kids or your children, it'd be a different story. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10722.044s">And</a> the irony to this whole classic event was on the next night, up at the high school, in the library, a meeting on safety at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10733.789s">Well,</a> if anyone went up there, you could walk into the building, no security guard, you could walk down the corridor to the library, no security guard, walk into the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10745.214s">What</a> do you see, a police officer inside the library? <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10747.468s">but</a> no one at the front door, and nobody in the hallway. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10750.191s">And</a> it's just as Councilor Marks alluded to, anybody could have walked into that building, put anything in that building at any time. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10755.816s">That's</a> not instilling fear, that's the facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10758.179s">That's</a> the hot, cold facts of what we're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10761.222s">And</a> when you cut 80% of your security budget in the school department, <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10764.685s">Over</a> the past five or six years, that's what you get. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10767.468s">An</a> insecure situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10769.03s">That's</a> not instilling fear. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10770.611s">That's</a> telling you you need to get your act together and protect those children up at that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10775.155s">Because</a> that's what it's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10776.236s">That's</a> their responsibility as a school committee and as a superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10781.373s">That's</a> a damn shame that that even took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10784.116s">And</a> it's a shame that you're now hearing that you're going to get something that Councilor Alongo-Kern has alluded to, you want a copy of it when it comes out. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10791.685s">So</a> apparently there wasn't any problem, I mean, any protocol. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10795.269s">There</a> wasn't any management technique to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10798.874s">And</a> as of yesterday, from what I understand, <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10801.232s">from</a> speaking to some of the students and a few of the teachers, they still weren't aware until many days after the fact that a bomb threat had taken place in that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10809.794s">That</a> is absolutely not fair and not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10813.295s">Absolutely</a> not. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10814.296s">And</a> I think it needs to be understood what a lockdown is as compared to what an evacuation is, as compared to a low level, a high level, and what a risk might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10823.278s">A</a> teacher's not going to be Houdini to try to figure this out. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10826.019s">And</a> apparently, a parent isn't, especially if they're not even notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10831.02s">Yes,</a> I will stand here and I say I resent the libelous comment made by the superintendent of schools who said because I came up here, and you, Councilor Lungo-Koehn, and you, Councilor Marks, and you, the citizens of this city, came up here to talk about a most egregious situation that's taking place in our city, and that's a lack of public safety and the communication to a parent if, in fact, public safety is challenged. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10854.617s">You,</a> Mr. Superintendent, you should be ashamed of yourself for writing that commentary and you should probably resign because of what you said and what you wrote. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10864.043s">How</a> dare you? <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10865.263s">How</a> dare you insinuate that anyone who comes for a podium and expresses their opinion is causing fear when in fact they were representing facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10874.869s">F-A-C-T-S.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10876.47s">Facts</a> that took place under your watch, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10880.653s">Mr.</a> President, I thank you for allowing me to make my comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10883.805s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_mnqErCY2Ajc/2025-03-21_mnqErCY2Ajc.html">Medford, MA City Council - Feb. 9, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2749.191s">My</a> name is Robert Pantor. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2750.132s">I</a> live at Zero Summit, Rome. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2751.572s">I'm</a> a member of the Sarkis party that's deliberating here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2754.832s">On</a> the outside, I'd like to thank my colleague, um, strike that council Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2759.173s">I</a> would consider a colleague forever because I think she's doing what she's supposed to be doing and that's the people's work. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2765.635s">You</a> know, you folks are sitting here as Councilors like I did for, for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2771.196s">Your</a> most important job is to protect, <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2773.713s">to</a> protect the students, the children of this community, because that's what our budget's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2778.335s">That's</a> what our school department budget's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2780.476s">And</a> that's what public safety is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2782.517s">Sure,</a> there's adults and there's businesses to be concerned about, but it's the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2786.058s">That's</a> what we're trying to do here is educate our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2789.4s">And</a> how do we educate our children? <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2790.781s">By</a> teaching the difference between what is right and what is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2793.582s">And</a> as they grow up to be youngsters and teenagers and adults, that's supposed to transcend into their everyday working operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2801.892s">We've</a> just had three incidences take place here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2805.554s">One</a> that took place in November, where there was a bomb threat, allegedly a bomb threat. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2810.356s">Medford</a> police went to the high school, and their dog sniffing dogs were not allowed into the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2816.479s">That</a> didn't even find a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2818.641s">Then</a> you had the incident five days before the election this past November, where at the McGlynn School, somebody broke into the school, ransacked through, I believe, eight teachers' bags, and you didn't hear about that until five days later. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2831.524s">And</a> now you have this incident that took place most recently, and as Councilor Marksley alluded to, eight days after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2838.927s">You</a> have a responsibility because when you do that budget each and every year, you're being led to believe by the school department and the school committee that everything is going properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2847.33s">You</a> have a superintendent of schools whose primary responsibility, over and beyond educating the kids first, <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2853.957s">is</a> the safety of those kids in every single building that they are in here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2858.919s">And</a> that safety cannot be transcended by waiting days and days and days. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2863.441s">Now</a> I understand what Councilor Falco was leading to, that tomorrow night there's a meeting, but there is a yes answer to this meeting tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2869.543s">And</a> the yes answer to this meeting is to let anybody who wants to talk about it come up, and the answer would be yes, allowing them to talk and speak about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2877.986s">Because</a> if they can't make it tomorrow night, <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2879.928s">becomes</a> informational for those who didn't know about it to be at the meeting tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2884.411s">But</a> more importantly, it's the public safety that really has not been addressed by the at-present school administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2892.678s">And</a> if you said, Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Palacio, the two of you put together some kind of a program and the protocol hasn't been met, <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2900.037s">then</a> so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2900.998s">Then</a> somebody has to be held accountable and maybe their job should be put on the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2905.281s">Because</a> if it was their kid and their child was threatened with a bomb in the school and they weren't told about it until six or seven hours after the fact on a robocall, that doesn't satisfy or suffice the purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2916.91s">On</a> January 18th, you had Groton, Ayers, Arlington, Tewksbury, Taunton, <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2923.191s">Salisbury,</a> Weymouth, Newton, Brighton, Boston, Swampscott, Lexington Minuteman. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2928.833s">A</a> bomb threat was over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2930.814s">Two</a> things took place over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2932.555s">They</a> either evacuated the building or there was a lockdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2935.476s">What's</a> the difference between the two? <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2937.197s">Needs</a> to be explained. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2938.457s">Does</a> a lockdown complete the service of saying that the school is safe or not?

<a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2961.623s">Where's</a> the public relations coming out on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2964.145s">And</a> if it truly has been eight days after the fact, why are you having a meeting eight days after the fact if in fact the consultation took place between the school administration <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2974.455s">the</a> state police, and the area surrounding police departments to find out the protocol, whether it's high level, low level, or no level. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2982.038s">Who</a> are they to make that decision? <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2984.358s">The</a> school committee, the school department should have some type of an ember alert that addresses itself, like they do when they come out to mass, when a child disappears, or a senior citizen is missing, or a person in general is missing, for whatever the reasons might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2998.3s">You</a> know, we're living in a day and age today that is not the same as 1950, 60, 70. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3002.846s">It's</a> not even the same as it was five years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3005.789s">We're</a> living in a world that's talentious. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3007.752s">It's</a> crazy with people. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3009.454s">And</a> it has a deep concern that everyone's child that goes to a school should be considered to be safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3015.441s">and</a> in a safe place. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3017.002s">But</a> when you're talking about something like this tonight, it's not in a safe place because the protocols weren't met. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3023.524s">And</a> if the protocols aren't being met, then there is something wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3026.546s">There's</a> a breakdown in the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3028.346s">That's</a> why we're paying a superintendent in excess of $160,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3031.227s">You</a> have two assistant superintendents, well in excess of $120,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3035.029s">They</a> have a responsibility to this community, whether it's your kids, my kids, grandchildren, or someone else's children. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3043.332s">And</a> that's to ensure that when they go to that school, barring any unforeseen circumstance, and if something were to happen, the parent should be advised ASAP. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3053.074s">I</a> wouldn't want a superintendent or a teacher to say whether they make the decision whether my child should be there or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3059.436s">It's</a> kind of like interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3060.836s">If</a> you follow the whole idea about testing and MCAS and everything else and Common Core and draw the correlation to it, if the child or the parent doesn't want the kid to take it, they can opt out. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3072.829s">magnify</a> that to a bomb threat in a building and not tell the parent for eight hours after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3079.673s">There</a> is no correlation. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3081.253s">There</a> is no justice to this whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3083.475s">And</a> whatever comes out of this meeting tomorrow night, I hope it just proves one thing that those who were responsible, who didn't do their job are charged for not doing their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3093.059s">They're</a> replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3093.98s">And</a> we have a system in place that you don't have to have this type of a conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3098.322s">I</a> applaud you, Councilor Longo, for bringing this forward because this gets to the very heart of the citizens of Medford, its children, its core, its future for tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3107.75s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_WZBDDeqA2qI/2025-03-21_WZBDDeqA2qI.html">Medford, MA City Council - Jan. 19, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1206.822s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1207.603s">My</a> name is Robert Penter. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1208.524s">I</a> live at Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1211.358s">Last</a> week we had a conversation regarding these, this position and the issue as it relates to, um, since we're talking about the chief of staff position right now, um, the concern that a chief of staff would have, especially as it relates to the working operation, not only of the mayor's office, but the interaction of all department heads and employees here in the city of Medford and outside concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1231.969s">What</a> bothers me on this particular matter right now is that this position, which became effective on January 4th of this year, <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1238.92s">Um,</a> since it's a title to position and it's a compensated position in a, in a CAF, um, category, um, you're approving it now tonight, but it's been operative, uh, since January 4th of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1250.888s">Uh,</a> last week, um, I brought up the issue and I don't see any, unless you guys and ladies have a paper on your agenda here. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1258.412s">Uh,</a> the relative to the fact that our city auditor has been asked to also, um, entertain doing the duties of the treasurer collector. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1266.548s">And</a> from last week to this week, I've consulted with the division of local services and the department of revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1272.01s">And</a> it's absolutely, you cannot do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1274.571s">The</a> city auditor cannot do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1276.152s">It's</a> a, it's a prerogative and it's a concern of chief.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1281.294s">It's</a> an issue that a chief of staff would look into. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1285.396s">With</a> due respect to the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1288.217s">With</a> due respect, Mr. President, the chief of staff is an advisor, is an advisor to the mayor of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1294.11s">And</a> the advice to the mayor of the community over and beyond legal advice would be whether this is an allowable or whether it's allowable or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1302.274s">There's</a> no case law and there is no state statute that allows whether it be temporary or what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1308.297s">And</a> as a result of that, I think it's something that needs to be addressed because the chief of staff who's been operating since January 4th of this year, it's obvious that that information either has been given to the incumbent mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1320.204s">or</a> the president administration just refuses to, um, abide by it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1324.867s">The</a> law is also quite succinct in its, um, in its review that under chapter 41, section 52, all accounts are rendered to be kept in the departments of any city shall be subject to the inspection of the city auditor or officer having similar duties. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1341.418s">So</a> we know now on the chapter 41, section 52, that that's the auditor's position as it relates to <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1347.002s">not</a> being allowed to do any other position in the department, I mean, in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1351.485s">And</a> chapter 41, section 55 clearly delineates the fact that the town accountant shall be sworn to the faithful performance of his duties, shall hold no other town office involving the receipt or disbursement of monies. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1364.755s">If</a> you've already had a chief of staff since January 5th of this year, that is a known fact that should not be allowed to take place, temporary or otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1373.501s">There</a> is nothing in state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1374.862s">There</a> is no state statute. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1376.379s">and</a> there is no case law that allows this to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1379.12s">The</a> only exemption to the rule is- We have before us- Pardon me? <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1381.901s">We</a> have before us, sir- We're talking about the chief of staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1383.822s">The</a> chief of staff position.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1386.643s">It's</a> one of the duties that a chief of staff does, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1398.368s">I</a> believe the city solicitor was here last week, and in our conversation he did acknowledge the fact that there is no case law, number one, and there is no <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1405.883s">state</a> statute that allows it for temporary or otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1409.305s">He's</a> here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1410.426s">He</a> can stand on his own two feet to say it, but I think the OR is quite succinct. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1414.028s">But</a> more importantly, it's the position of the chief of staff, and they should know this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1417.89s">And</a> this new administration should not be going into a territory knowing that it's in violation of state statute. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1424.414s">Now,</a> the unfortunate part about this whole issue right now is that you have a city solicitor that represents the mayor, that represents the city council, that represents the board of appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1433.139s">And</a> if there's a difference of opinion as to <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1435.414s">who</a> should prevail. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1437.014s">It's</a> quite obvious if the council needs to have a question answered, you still haven't gotten that answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1441.755s">And</a> I think you are entitled to have that answer legally, right, wrong, or indifferent. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1446.617s">I</a> stand here, and I'll be willing to be corrected. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1449.197s">But</a> for my information that I've been able to ascertain, and now speaking with the Division of Local Services at the Department of Revenue, you cannot do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1456.559s">And</a> the law is quite succinct on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1458.326s">That</a> is a prerogative, and that's a detailed description that a chief of staff does. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1462.651s">They</a> are the advisor. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1464.413s">They</a> are the advisor. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1465.454s">And</a> if their advice to the present administration was not consulted with the city's law department, well, that's a mistake there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1472.842s">But</a> if the law department is basically saying this— Point of information, Councilor Knight.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1516.458s">On</a> the motion for approval by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1518.319s">Mr.</a> President, no one is standing here to interrupt the appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1521.802s">The</a> fact of the matter is that that person has been in the position since January 4th of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1526.306s">So</a> all you're doing is finalizing something that was initiated on January 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1530.629s">The</a> person is in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1532.048s">The</a> papers have already gone out. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1533.368s">The</a> individual is signing off as chief of staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1535.549s">So</a> it's already a done deal, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1537.95s">And</a> this council deserves to have, within its own bailiwick of information, the fact whether this is right or wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1543.952s">Because</a> if this council is just going to sit there, it would ignore the fact that a city auditor is also assuming the position as a treasurer collector, when you know that there was a young lady, Judy Johnson, who's worked very hard, very capable to be that person, to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1557.516s">Why</a> is that not happening? <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1559.737s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1561.019s">The</a> ball's in your court. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1561.88s">You</a> folks can do what you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1563.401s">But</a> this isn't a good message sending out to the people of this community, that you have a present administration that's potentially working with the conflict of interest and in violation of the law by having one person, the city auditor, assume two positions, that and that of the treasurer-collector, when you have a qualified person downstairs in that office that could do the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1581.354s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1582.135s">Well,</a> I'd like to ask you, Mr. President, is the city council going to request <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1585.73s">a</a> legal opinion on that because I think it's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1588.191s">As</a> a citizen, I'd like to ask one of my colleagues to make that request to the city administration, whether Mrs. Baker on the chapter 41, chapter 41, section 55 is entitled to be the city and the town treasurer at the same time.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1612.054s">Mr.</a> President, with all due respect to my colleague, he knows.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3243.293s">Please</a> state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3245.014s">Good</a> evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3245.415s">My</a> name is Robert Penter. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3246.515s">I</a> live at Zero Summit Road in Massachusetts, and I think we're in an area right now where we have a unique opportunity to really look at what our audiences are saying and where we can be going, because if we're going to relegate ourselves to changing audiences, maybe we should just look at the total picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3262.665s">The</a> total picture revolves itself around to the victor goes to spoils, and I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3267.743s">But</a> rather than change our municipal ordinance or any ordinance, maybe we ought to take advantage of what the law already allows for. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3275.546s">The</a> new administration does have a unique opportunity to hire any individual he or she would like. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3281.768s">Massachusetts</a> General Laws, Chapter 4, Section 7, Sixth A, allows for coterminous appointments that would exist to that of the mayor in this particular situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3294.763s">And</a> what would happen there, that the individual who would be appointed would not be subject to any municipal ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3301.408s">They</a> would just be subject to this particular law, which happens to be state statute, and every person that's in the mayor's office, which is an administrative appointment, would find itself in a co-terminus position as it relates to the term that the mayor sits in that office. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3316.598s">If,</a> in fact, a new mayor were to come in in the future, the person sitting in that position would then be reviewed <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3322.505s">at</a> a subsequent time by the then new mayor for the purposes of whether they continue to be coterminous or whether in fact they are going to be eliminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3331.587s">They</a> would come under the same privileges of having a review to their job, their job application, and what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3337.768s">The</a> second portion that you would have to look at is these individuals are serving at an at-will position. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3345.165s">The</a> mayor chooses individuals to work in that particular office, his or her office. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3349.65s">And</a> by looking at having that person sit in that particular office, you have to take into consideration the fact that are we putting people in there because of a municipal ordinance? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3360.302s">Are</a> we putting people in there because it's going to be coterminous? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3362.704s">Are</a> we putting those people in there because they're at will? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3365.928s">Now,</a> if you look at all the state rules and laws and regulations as it relates to at-will contracts, you can have these made in such a way that you can fire them and hire them anytime they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3375.555s">They</a> can leave anytime they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3376.856s">You</a> can have an employment contract that basically relegates what their terms and duties are in this particular office. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3382.801s">And</a> to do that, that sets the tempo of making sure that you do have and you have hired the right person. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3388.865s">For</a> example, you might hire somebody and the person just doesn't work out six, seven months down the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3394.249s">Then</a> what are you going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3395.729s">If</a> you stick with the municipal ordinance the way it is, you're not going to have the same luxury of either an at-will or a coterminous type of an individual, because that way the other review factor would be part and parcel of what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3408.134s">Second</a> of all, and more importantly, whether it's this position or any other position, you have to look at the conflict of interest issue that revolves around the people in this particular case. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3417.997s">In</a> this particular case, you already have one individual that's working in the office, I believe it was on or about January, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3425.547s">in</a> January, early January, and this individual also happens to be on the, on the transition team. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3432.372s">Well,</a> being on a transition team and also getting paid by the city of Medford for being an individual working in the mayor's office right now, I think presents itself, Mr. Solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3442.22s">And</a> I asked the question, I begged the question, so to speak, is there a conflict of interest? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3446.604s">Because</a> the impartiality of a transition team is supposed to bring the recommendations <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3450.89s">to</a> the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3452.23s">But</a> when you're getting paid by the administration, and you're also on this transition team, you're also, I think, if you look under the conflict of interest law, you're possibly looking or possibly indicating that there could be a conflict, there might be a conflict, or it could appear to be a conflict. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3466.453s">And</a> really, that's what you don't want right now, especially starting off with a brand new administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3471.194s">So</a> I would suggest to my colleagues, as you review this thing in your committee of the whole, that you <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3477.083s">look</a> into this thing a little bit further, over and beyond changing a municipal ordinance or adding or subtracting to it, and look at the term that's allowed by state statute under the term of being either coterminous or at-will employees, because your responsibility back to the taxpayers is not the same as that of the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3494.672s">If</a> you appropriate money for those particular positions, the question then becomes, after that appropriation, you have absolutely no control. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3502.536s">You'll</a> have absolutely no control over that employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3505.093s">other</a> than the chief executive officer making the final decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3508.295s">So</a> if you want to ask the hard questions, this is the time to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3511.717s">But</a> you do have options, and your options are either serve coterminously, number one, at will, number two, and more importantly, I think you really need to look at the conflict of interest that presently exists in the office, because I don't think it's right that someone who's on the transition team at the same time is getting paid well in excess of $90,000 to sit in the mayor's office at the present time and take on another job and duty and responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3533.608s">the</a> same job and duty of responsibility that will come up in the next issue that's going to be presented before you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3539.43s">I'll</a> be more than happy to answer any questions, but I just think you really need to look at this thing more in its totality as to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3545.713s">And</a> I really think Councilor Lungo-Koehn is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3548.174s">I</a> think you need a listing of every single person, their job classification, who they're replacing, and more importantly, what's the difference in the salaries, because that's going to make a big difference as to why are we making these changes at all and for what reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3561.113s">And</a> I think you deserve that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3562.114s">And</a> that's what transparency is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3564.215s">And</a> you should not be afraid to ask the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3566.316s">It's</a> the taxpayer's money. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3568.257s">And</a> it's your duty and responsibility, as it was mine when I was sitting on that side, to make sure that the money was accounted for properly and appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3576.181s">So</a> that's it, if anyone wants to ask any questions.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4441.418s">Watch</a> the button there, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4442.378s">I</a> did. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4442.998s">Bob</a> Penta, 07 Road Method Mask. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4445.219s">I'd</a> just like to bring your attention to the number F section over there, where it says report to the director of finance auditing on matters that pertain to procurement. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4454.441s">On</a> January 5th of this year, the city administration appointed Ann Baker to also be the city treasurer, beside being the city auditor. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4462.602s">She</a> can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4463.443s">It's</a> illegal. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4464.003s">It's</a> against the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4465.601s">and</a> I don't even know why she's being allowed to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4469.023s">The</a> second section of the law is very specific as it relates to where we're going on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4473.825s">Chapter</a> 41, section 52 states that all accounts are rendered to be kept in the departments of the city shall be subject to the inspection of the city auditor or officer having similar duties. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4486.231s">Now,</a> the term city auditor and town auditor is interchangeable under our state statute. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4491.073s">Then</a> you go to chapter 41, section 55, and it's clear as a bell. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4495.75s">The</a> town accountant shall be sworn to the faithful performance of his duties, shall hold no other town office involving the receipt or disbursement of monies." <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4505.133s">So,</a> I don't know where you're going with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4507.693s">I</a> think Mr. Solicitor, you need to look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4509.534s">I</a> could be wrong, but the way I read that, your town auditor or your city auditor, which is Ann Baker, is also now, as of January 5th, the city's tax collector. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4519.176s">She</a> can hold both those positions, a direct conflict of law. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4522.448s">Uh,</a> it's conflict of interest, excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4524.269s">And</a> the law is very specific, especially chapter 41, section 55. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4527.931s">I</a> think a committee of the whole is so important to understand all the ramifications, you know, what this is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4535.135s">Um,</a> you, as I said before, you have a lady that's a come on board from the transition team at $106,000 a year, um, as the director of budget and personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4545.901s">And</a> that's what her title is, unless that's going to change in the future, what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4549.866s">These</a> are issues that I think the council needs to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4551.947s">I</a> think you need to know all the names, the dollar amounts, and wherever you're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4555.589s">But</a> the conflicts that possibly and potentially arise, and this is one. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4559.311s">It's</a> as clear as a bell. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4560.472s">She</a> got appointed in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4562.033s">She</a> is our city auditor. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4563.854s">And</a> apparently, she's going to be the city treasurer for another 60 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4567.476s">You</a> can't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4568.777s">The</a> law is specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4569.757s">It's</a> not me saying it. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4571.038s">It's</a> the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4571.558s">You</a> only can serve one master. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4572.739s">You</a> only can serve one position at one time, especially in the city or town. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4577.233s">And</a> with all due respect, I just think before you guys just jump in, ladies, before you jump into this thing, I think you really need to understand the full ramifications. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4585.079s">Not</a> only that, but the background of the individuals that are accepting these positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4589.722s">Again,</a> the mayor, whoever he or she might be, has that privilege of hiring whoever they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4595.586s">But</a> if there's a potential conflict, that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4599.208s">And</a> then if there's also a possibility that, I'm not saying take the job out of a classification, I'm saying take the job out of a time sequence. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4606.929s">and</a> make it run coterminous with the mayor, whether it's a CAF 14, 18, 22, whatever it might be, as it designated to the terminology, chief of staff, secretary. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4616.394s">I've</a> got no problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4617.794s">That's</a> not the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4618.575s">The</a> real issue is the person that's being hired, whether it's at will or whether it's coterminous. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4623.677s">But</a> more importantly, in this particular case, I think it needs to be addressed immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4627.919s">Ann</a> Bega cannot be the city auditor. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4629.84s">She</a> cannot be the city's tax collector at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4632.982s">The</a> law is specific, chapter 41, section 55, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4636.213s">says</a> it, I don't say it, and I would expect that the city takes the appropriate action on that matter, just to make sure that they don't get themselves in any kind of a quandary as a conflict that possibly could exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4647.637s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4873.568s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4875.208s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4875.808s">Mr.</a> President, I would like to make a response since the city solicitor challenged. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4881.089s">Point</a> of order, Councilor Knight.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4934.881s">I'll</a> address my comments back to the City Council so we don't have to have a discourse back and forth between my friend, the City Solicitor, and myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4942.685s">If</a> he wanted to take that one step further as to what I said, I didn't say it was illegal, I said it has potential for conflict of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4948.948s">And</a> Councilman Marks is absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4950.849s">If</a> there is at present an Assistant City, what's her name, Treasurer, no, Mrs. Baker, an Assistant, there's two Assistants in both of those offices. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4963.562s">Whether</a> it's Ann Baker as the auditor or Fred Pompeo's office as an assistant, they both have two capable individuals that could assume either one of those roles. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4971.571s">And</a> my argument is, and it's very specific in here, I have a difference of opinion with my city solicitor friend, whether either one of those two assistants assume the position, but making one person assume both of them when you have other people just as capable <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4985.486s">and</a> able to do the job presents and begs the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4988.668s">And</a> that's what the issue is. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4990.189s">How's</a> the checks and balances going to take place? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4992.711s">A</a> city auditor is supposed to be the checks and balances as to how and when the city spends its money. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4998.195s">So</a> if the city auditor wants to challenge, you know, what the treasurer-collector has done in the past, which has been her job, now that person is assuming both those positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5008.302s">She</a> will have a conflict between herself as to what role am I supposed to play, the auditor or the treasurer-collector? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5015.207s">And</a> that makes no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5016.788s">And</a> especially since you have the personnel that are in this building, well qualified, work their way up to the ranks, they should be given that opportunity rather than even get into this discourse that we're having right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5027.396s">That's</a> what begs the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5028.957s">Why</a> are we even discussing this? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5030.278s">There</a> is no need for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5031.859s">You</a> have people in this building, they're getting paid, they've been trained, and they do their job well. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5037.343s">But</a> to take one person and put it in charge of two, which is the checks and balance person, how do you checks and balance yourself? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5045.234s">That</a> doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5047.415s">The</a> law is very specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5049.475s">You</a> only can serve one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5051.276s">And</a> whether it's temporary or not temporary, we're not at that juncture of the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5055.657s">Where</a> we are right now is the fact that you have personnel that are capable and able of doing the position. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5062.399s">And</a> that's what you should be talking about, and that's what should be being addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5066.301s">Not</a> one person assuming two positions and scratching their head and saying, what would happen if something were to happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5073.203s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7559.108s">Mr.</a> President? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7561.11s">Sir?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7561.29s">I'd</a> like to speak about... Please state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7564.252s">Bob</a> Henton from Zero Summit Road, Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7565.774s">I'd</a> like to speak about the contract in one particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7568.956s">If</a> you go back and look at the contract and look at the proposal that was made, we were talking at one point in time of possibly having zones here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7576.443s">And</a> to date, there are no zones, and none of the METAs are identified as being in any particular zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7582.707s">As</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7583.147s">Rodriguez</a> just got through saying, during this past month of December, people were putting money in the METAs, and the METAs were accepting them. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7591.452s">I</a> think the question needs to go a little bit further to the Park-Metford office to find out what their technology is, because they should be able to shut down that meter that indicates that they will not accept the money on any particular day. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7603.341s">As</a> far as the new meters in downtown Metford Square, I think Councilor Caraviello can attest to this, because I think he was a product of it, putting the money in the meter, and the meter did take the money in Metford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7615.27s">So</a> you have situations here that even where you have the pay park ones, and now you have the stanchions <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7621.321s">where</a> you put the quarters in, there are some problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7624.003s">I</a> think it would behoove the council not only to have your first annual update, Councilor Caraviello, as you were talking about, maybe to have them come in here and find out, especially with two new councillors, what your concerns might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7634.01s">They</a> indicated that they have all this technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7636.872s">They</a> have this computer app technology and whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7640.835s">But</a> there definitely are concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7642.276s">There</a> are people still getting tagged for no reason at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7645.678s">And</a> more importantly, there are no zones. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7647.379s">City</a> of Boston is very clear <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7649.257s">on</a> how they address their issue relative toward their parking and their meters, their zones and their territories. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7655.219s">It</a> would be very easy to put zone locations on each and every one of the meters and each and every one of the, you know, it doesn't take a lot to put, you know, the number, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7664.863s">And</a> you don't have to go through the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7667.123s">And</a> on Christmas Eve day, Christmas Eve day in the afternoon, people were getting tickets right up until six o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7674.566s">I</a> think that's just a little bit disingenuous, as I said before, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7678.072s">They're</a> nothing but a bunch of bounty hunters coming here to Boston and Medford, Massachusetts, to get as much money as they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7684.734s">And</a> it's just not working out. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7686.335s">And</a> with the two new councils on here, I would hope that they would be brought up to date that the past council, the very past one in December, voted seven to nothing to give the senior citizens in the city of Medford the break of not being able to pay, because that was one of the concerns that was attributed by the president administration that they would do. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7704.602s">So</a> I think it's an issue that needs to be addressed, and I think it's an issue <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7708.332s">that</a> should work well for the City of Medford, especially for the seniors in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7712.513s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_hBLcCaD3s_8/2025-03-21_hBLcCaD3s_8.html">Medford City Council - Dec. 22, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=597.462s">Why</a> couldn't that money be incorporated as part of the office of community development who was desperately in need of folks to have a professional consultant come in as we talked about before? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=607.155s">just</a> taking $250,000 and spending it randomly at five squares doesn't make as much sense as having a paid professional and here's where the money could come from. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=616.041s">It</a> would even have to come out of the city's budget and you would have a working operating capital to work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=620.985s">I</a> mean, the city is in desperate need of getting good professional people and I think this would be a better way to spend the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=627.669s">If</a> I would use the money to be spent, that's what I would go because <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=630.622s">You</a> need a professional person who's going to be able to tell you what's wrong, why these squares are not multiplying. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=635.828s">Just</a> to correct the sidewalk or plant a tree or do a window or put a facade, that doesn't still help the business district. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=641.695s">And</a> I think what you really need is a hardcore look and a reality check as to why these businesses aren't multiplying or doing as good as they should. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=649.275s">So</a> I would like to amend this to go one step further that that money be considered for the purposes of having a paid professional consultant be incorporated into the office of community development for the purposes of business development for the entire five squares in the city of method.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=697.125s">Well,</a> when this first came up, Mr. President, when they were talking about the $250,000 and there wasn't a definition on how this money was going to be spent, there was nothing that required the fact <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=706.337s">you</a> know, you couldn't use it for salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=707.778s">Now</a> you're putting a requirement on it that wasn't there in the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=711.101s">And</a> that right there in and of itself is just, you know, it's, it's stifling the whole idea of moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=717.847s">Why</a> can't this money just be put on hold until next year and then incorporate into next year's budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=722.571s">If</a> it's an, if it's an, if you're telling me if it's into the real estate account, why can't it just go into the real estate account and become effective January 1st when the city council, the then city council can make its recommendation.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=747.975s">But</a> why is it going into the real estate account? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=749.836s">Why</a> can't it go to free cash?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=757.879s">This</a> is being, where does it say that Louise?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=762.502s">That's</a> a 250 has to go into the real estate account.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=771.627s">But</a> that doesn't mean that the council can make a subsequent request to send it to free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=776.029s">I</a> would move amend the motion that it'd be sent to free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=778.231s">That</a> way the, the incoming council can have a better intelligent way of learning how to spend the money.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3841.056s">I</a> could tell you many stories about Paul Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3845.343s">I</a> first met Paul when he drove up to my house many, many years ago before he decided to run for school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3850.09s">And</a> from that point on, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3852.113s">It</a> became a relationship. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3853.855s">He</a> should really be working for the city in charge of constituent service. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3856.978s">Because</a> I think he really likes going out there and taking care of people's concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3860.842s">Because</a> he's like myself, he's a lover of government. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3862.664s">I</a> like government in a different way than he likes it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3865.006s">But</a> the interesting part about Paul Camuso, he has made my life extremely interesting for the last 16 years in this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3872.077s">Because</a> if it wasn't for him, a lot of these issues really would never be magnified to the point that they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3877.281s">Whether</a> you were a supporter or a proponent for the mayor or not or vice versa. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3881.264s">He</a> made it very interesting because sometimes that's what you really need. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3884.006s">You</a> need this discourse. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3885.066s">You</a> need this difference of opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3886.628s">And</a> when you have a difference of opinion, that's when you learn sometimes what the issue is about. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3890.532s">And</a> when the issue is being presented sometimes, you just lose concept of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3894.173s">But</a> Paul and I, I believe we've had many, many differences. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3897.694s">But</a> as he has said, at the end of the night, he'll come over and shake your hand, or I'll go over and talk to him, shake his hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3902.335s">It's</a> just an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3903.015s">And</a> that's all that it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3903.915s">And</a> you move on from the subject matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3906.215s">And</a> what's really interesting here, there's three people here that were, you people were that young when they first started? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3912.937s">I</a> don't believe it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3914.947s">But</a> I'm not that old, so that's the point, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3919.771s">So</a> I want to wish you good luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3921.373s">Like</a> him, I don't think he's going away. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3923.014s">He'll</a> be around, and he's just taking a pause in life, and that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3926.377s">And</a> sometimes you need to do that to refine yourself and get yourself back in action. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3930.661s">So</a> I congratulate you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3931.742s">Enjoy</a> your life. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3932.302s">Enjoy</a> your wife and your family, because that's what it's really about. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3934.945s">The</a> first thing in life is your family, and that's what you take care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3938.308s">Good</a> luck.

She gave me a guidepost that I used in this very past election. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4217.985s">It</a> basically was, true leadership is found in the plan that one has to offer for respectful consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4224.909s">As</a> we all know, I did not run for re-election to the Medford City Council this past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4229.832s">I</a> ran for the office of mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4232.0s">At</a> the outset, I want to thank Anthony D'Antonio, because four years ago, he broke the ice, saying in this community, someone can run against the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4240.547s">No</a> one is invincible, no one owns the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4243.369s">Unfortunately,</a> he didn't make it, but he tried, and he got 36% of the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4247.273s">That's</a> a huge number to get, coming out of the box for the very first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4251.836s">I</a> decided to run for this job this past time, only for one reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4256.79s">to</a> present a plan, a plan that would give you a vision, a plan that would give you an opportunity, and a plan that would tell you how your taxes and how your buildings and how your educational system would work. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4267.859s">I</a> have to thank my wife, Susan. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4271.402s">She</a> was the campaign manager to my campaign, and you know, I don't know why, she never was involved in politics before. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4278.167s">I</a> needed and wanted someone who could talk to me and relate to the, as the person on the street, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4283.681s">and</a> you can't say this, and this is what you should be doing, and how do we make this connection work? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4288.963s">She</a> stabilized me during this campaign, because everyone knows, at the drop of a dime, I could lose it, and I have, and I have, and I'll admit it, and I have, and I have probably at council meetings in the past through the years, and that's only because of my passion for the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4303.127s">That's</a> not because of any hate for or against any one person or any one issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4307.698s">You</a> know, the one thing this community really has to figure out, and with all due respect to the incoming administration, this election was not a landslide victory. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4316.064s">So</a> there's a lot of work to be done here to make this city go in the right direction and to bring people together. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4323.269s">And</a> to bring people together, there has to be an understanding that folks need to be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4327.933s">And</a> how do you get involved? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4328.853s">You</a> need to speak up. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4329.794s">You</a> come to that podium on a Tuesday night or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4333.877s">I</a> will assure you of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4336.297s">I</a> may be sitting there now up until January 4th, but I'll be behind that rail after January 4th, because if I think there's something... Because if I believe that there is something of major importance to our community, no voice should be stifled, past, present, or the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4363.619s">Because</a> that's what it's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4364.861s">I'm</a> 71 years old, and I'm proud of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4366.983s">But</a> I'm not old. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4368.024s">I'm</a> not going to sit in a rocking chair, and I'm not going away. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4378.137s">Two</a> particular points I want to bring up. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4380.179s">And</a> I think it definitely needs to be cleared up. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4382.795s">because</a> it was misdirected during this past campaign for mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4387.6s">I</a> was never against new schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4389.903s">What</a> I was against was the opportunity for the people of Medford to have voted for new schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4394.468s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4395.689s">Number</a> two, you were taking away your community schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4398.192s">So</a> when we went to 14 schools down to four, that was a huge change in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4402.974s">And</a> a lot of people did not have their input into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4406.256s">And</a> as a result of that, and the reason why we built new schools at that point in time, some 15 years ago, was the schools were becoming run down. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4414.12s">They</a> were becoming misused or not used correctly, and they needed a lot of repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4419.282s">Well,</a> here we are now, some 15 years later. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4422.483s">Rick</a> Caviale, on his first year on the term, that's four years ago, that would have made it 11 years ago, produced a paper that said the new schools are $1,102,000 in repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4433.826s">We're</a> right back to where we were. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4435.487s">That's</a> why we built the new schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4437.267s">There</a> is the need to making sure that the new council, the new school committee stays on top of their buildings, because look right up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4443.929s">That's</a> almost three years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4446.17s">Three</a> years old, and the city has yet to fix that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4448.972s">And</a> the superintendent of schools was sitting right over there when that ceiling fell, and it still hasn't been fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4454.736s">People,</a> you've got to be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4456.237s">You</a> need to stay involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4458.559s">You</a> know, I'm over this feeling right now of being sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4461.741s">I'm</a> not sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4463.483s">I'm</a> glad because I have created a new family for myself, a family of people not only who believe, but they need and they want the change to take place in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4472.669s">They</a> don't want it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4484.613s">You</a> know, this past election presented an awful lot of opportunities for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4488.455s">Opportunities</a> for people to write for or write against. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4490.736s">Whether</a> you liked me or didn't like me, whether you liked my opponent, whether you liked my Councilors or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4495.039s">You</a> have two brand new Councilors, you have two brand new school committee people. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4497.56s">That</a> in and of itself should open up big doors for the people in this community who want to see how and where their election process is going. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4505.925s">And</a> do they vote for the right people? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4508.514s">The</a> only way you're gonna find out if you vote for the right people, don't wait for two years and wait for the campaign literature to come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4514.237s">Watch,</a> as I will, each and every week and each and every month, what's taking place on the school committee, what's taking place at the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4520.961s">And</a> if you don't like it, speak up, I'll call your council, I'll call your school committee person. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4525.023s">You</a> just can't be a lump in the log and say, I'm against it, I don't like it, you need to speak up. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4530.367s">And</a> people did speak up in this last election. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4532.668s">Unfortunately,</a> it was a beautiful day, only 38% of the people came out to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4536.772s">Hopefully,</a> I think on both sides, everybody would have thought more people would have come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4539.955s">But</a> they didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4540.975s">But</a> the 38 percent, they spoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4543.137s">It</a> was close, and I think we'll all acknowledge the fact it was close. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4546.059s">So</a> there's no mandate one way or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4547.64s">But</a> there is one mandate, and that's this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4549.702s">I</a> think the people of this community expect the elected politicians to do their job on behalf of the people of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4555.346s">And</a> that's what I did for 36 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4557.448s">I</a> did my job, and I'm proud of the fact that I did do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4573.173s">You</a> know, there's always people during the campaign that you want to acknowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4577.296s">And</a> there's so many. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4578.217s">I</a> could look at this entire audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4580.138s">But</a> to me, he's my unsung hero in each and every one of my campaigns. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4583.601s">Whenever</a> I ask him to do anything, he just does it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4585.743s">And</a> there's no questions asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4587.064s">And</a> that's my brother, Anthony. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4588.165s">And</a> I have to publicly acknowledge him, because that's what he is. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4599.293s">And</a> I just caught her eye in the back of the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4601.681s">And</a> I want to publicly acknowledge you, Nancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4603.922s">You</a> came here on behalf of the Perica family. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4606.903s">She</a> and her family stood out at the polls for me on Election Day because they believed in me, and I thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4612.466s">Nancy</a> Perica. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4623.551s">You</a> know, we could go on and on with stories here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4626.152s">And</a> the second thing, I told you about the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4628.473s">And</a> the second thing are the kiosks here in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4631.423s">As</a> you all know, I'm just dead set against them. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4633.164s">I</a> don't think they're working right. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4634.344s">I</a> don't think they, I don't think that, you know, you know, there's, there's a resolution on the council agenda here tonight and it reflects upon the fact that during this past campaign, my opponent put out a questionnaire as it relates to senior citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4647.41s">Should</a> they be allowed to park for nothing? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4649.191s">Not</a> only do I support that, if we're going to tweak it, then let it be tweaked and give some benefit back to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4654.694s">And</a> I would hope that this city council holds the president administration <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4658.462s">feet</a> to the fire by telling the Republic parking people that seniors do not have to park here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4662.905s">It's</a> bad enough that you get taxed for everything else, and 45 percent of this community is made up of seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4667.628s">Give</a> them a break, folks, because you get the water, you get the meals tax, you get the hotel tax, and you get your real estate tax, and anything else you want to talk about just keeps going up in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4677.034s">And</a> while everything keeps going up in this community, salaries have not gotten up. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4681.176s">Everyone</a> that works in this building works for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4683.718s">Your</a> taxpaying dollars pay for everyone's job in this particular building. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4687.693s">To</a> get your biggest bank for the buck, let them work for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4690.455s">And</a> that would be an easy way to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4691.796s">Remember,</a> this republic company is here for 10 years, and you've got no control over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4695.878s">But</a> the one thing you have control over is the people who signed off on that contract, and they have a right to go there and negotiate. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4702.123s">And</a> when my opposition turn around and put that out there, and that's one thing I would be supportive of, that senior citizens of this city park for nothing in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4710.168s">They</a> don't deserve to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4718.652s">When</a> I mention my wife Susan, you have to understand something. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4722.315s">As</a> much as a novice she is, she's been an educator for 23 years as a retired school teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4727.619s">So</a> she knows what English, the language is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4730.441s">Sometimes</a> when I talk too fast, I say the wrong words. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4733.204s">It</a> just doesn't come out right. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4735.205s">And</a> she says, you can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4736.306s">You</a> can't say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4737.787s">But</a> I am blessed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4739.929s">You</a> know, Paul sort of like hit it on the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4742.571s">I've</a> been blessed with two women in my life and two families in my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4749.478s">I</a> am a very lucky man. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4750.539s">I</a> am very thankful. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4753.902s">I</a> didn't lose an election. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4754.882s">You</a> know what I won? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4756.223s">I</a> won the people of the city of Medford who believed in Bob Penta because I believe in you folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4761.468s">And</a> with that being said, I want to conclude by saying the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4764.79s">My</a> friend, Jimmy DeVito, you'll understand this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4767.673s">In</a> 1942, it was General Douglas MacArthur who had to leave the Philippine Islands because at the Battle of Bataan, they got beaten up pretty bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4777.721s">And</a> he was supposed to be taking a submarine to leave the islands, because eventually he had to get to Australia. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4784.222s">But</a> he decided not to take that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4785.823s">He</a> decided to take a PT boat and go up in the middle of the night to beat the Japanese at that point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4791.184s">And</a> unfortunately, they ran into inclement weather on the whole nine yards. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4795.005s">So</a> as a result of that, he was one of the two days in the water. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4798.306s">He</a> was in open water. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4800.364s">But</a> he was very lucky, because there was no Japanese boat that saw him traversing that water, getting to where he had to go to, in Mindanao. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4811.328s">Two</a> days later, when he finally landed there, he made a very famous speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4816.009s">And</a> when he made that speech, it was in Melbourne, Australia. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4819.25s">And</a> this is what he said. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4820.891s">This</a> is his declaratory lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4822.311s">He</a> says, I came through, and I shall return. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4827.806s">I</a> took those lines and he says, how can I make that work for me tonight? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4832.49s">So</a> this is what I said. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4834.772s">With</a> that said, and with a Penta on the city ballots for the past 38 years, stay tuned. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4841.417s">And</a> while there may be a Penta in a pause mode, there will be a Penta to be continued in our days ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4864.138s">I</a> thank you, my family, my friends, and even those folks who don't like me or didn't vote for me, because you know why? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4870.082s">You</a> expressed your opinion, and I'm okay with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4872.784s">And</a> for all those who've supported me in my positions through the years, and may our loving and forgiving God bless all of us, and may God bless us all as he sees fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4881.95s">Bon</a> attab. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4882.671s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4900.016s">I</a> would be absolutely remiss if I didn't say this, because the highest thing on my scale of friendship is loyalty, and I forgot to say it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4909.163s">There's</a> one person, and I will embarrass him, he's right over there, that guy right there, Michael Marks, from the day that I announced. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4924.954s">From</a> the day that I announced, no questions asked, he stepped up, came forward, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4930.287s">over</a> and beyond my friends, my new extended family of friends, but for an elected official to put his neck on the line, no questions asked, no wanting for anything, that to me is what it's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4941.875s">These</a> are my friends, you are my friends, and God bless you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4944.717s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5034.93s">I</a> would be absolutely remiss. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5037.211s">My</a> daughter, Kim. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5038.611s">My</a> son-in-law, Patrick. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5041.152s">Aaron,</a> my extended daughter. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5047.575s">Aaron.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7849.222s">As</a> I said earlier this evening in some of my remarks, one of the things that <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7853.714s">seems</a> to have been a concern during this past campaign was the parking in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7859.078s">But</a> the incoming administration over and beyond the August questionnaire that was sent out and then the commitment that was made during this past campaign and one of the debates indicated that the administration would move for a senior citizen discount with Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7875.267s">So</a> I would request that the council go on record to show the support for that as it relates to <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7880.814s">that</a> for which had come up as a campaign issue and a commitment made by the incoming administration.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7896.418s">Roll</a> call vote, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7940.278s">Mr.</a> President, I would stick to the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7943.24s">It's</a> a separate itemized issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7944.64s">It</a> has makes no difference as it relates to what is going to be going forward with Louise Miller or anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7949.643s">It's</a> a, it's an item that was used as a campaign issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7952.504s">It</a> was an item that was voted upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7954.025s">It</a> was an item that was campaigned on and it was an item committed upon by the incoming administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7959.727s">So</a> being isolated as it is and following forward with that, Mr. President, I think it would be a good way. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7965.87s">and</a> some good strength to have the incoming administration realize that the City Council supports that resolution.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8018.214s">Mr.</a> President, unfortunately at this time of the year, individuals, some individuals get recognized for whatever their contributions might be, but there is a whole host of community folks, businesses, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8028.673s">and</a> individuals who contribute all during the year for the purposes of helping those who are in need. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8034.378s">For</a> example, you have one of the banks in the square, without mentioning them, has an annual thing for Toys for Tots. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8041.484s">You</a> have the Medford Fire Department, who has an ongoing Christmas season situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8046.408s">But</a> you have individual people who are philanthropic unto their own right, and they don't want any recognition at all, they just do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8052.453s">So,</a> it doesn't make any difference whether you're a private business, a union, an individual, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8057.816s">These</a> people, to some degree, if they're watching, should know that their contributions are recognized and appreciated, and as a result of that, it's our little way of saying thank you to them for being supportive for people in need when not asked to do so.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8086.978s">No,</a> it happened to come up in conversation, but the fact of the matter is in this recent monthly December bill, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8092.575s">from</a> Comcast, it'll show that it's going from $3.25 to $5. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8095.696s">Now</a> that's an increase of $1.75 a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8098.996s">The</a> city is presently sitting on over $450,000 of PEG access money, cable access monies, and as a result of that, still having no public access television here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8110.178s">And</a> the city's use of those monies to pay for salaries up at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8113.939s">I</a> think it's incumbent upon the incoming city council to make a demand <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8118.097s">from</a> the incoming administration, whether, in fact, they are going to have cable, public access, TV3, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8124.659s">And</a> there might be a twist to that, because I think if we have all been watching what's on the news lately, there's a movement afoot between Channel 7 to possibly take over, that for which Comcast has right now, which is Nessun, and I forget the other one, and WHCH. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8144.181s">And</a> with that being said, there is a possibility, if in fact this merger were to go through, and I think it would be the second highest, a multi-billion dollar merger, what could possibly happen as a movement, because if NBC does buy out the franchise, Anson, that they're looking to buy out, they could possibly retrieve the cable location of TV3 that we presently have. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8169.872s">and</a> put it in a different spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8171.253s">That's</a> okay, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8172.633s">But</a> in the contract, on page five, it says the following, PEG's access channels, any licensee-owned channels made available by the licensee in the situation as Comcast and provided for use for the presentations of PEG access programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8186.52s">So</a> if, in fact, if you read the contract and if you follow what's going on in the news, that if, in fact, this were to take place, there's a possibility of one or two things that ANSEN, WHCH, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8198.803s">could</a> probably be bought out by NBC, and so wouldn't be Channel 6. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8205.688s">It's</a> a side issue as it relates to the main subject matter, which is public access television, but I really think you two guys coming on as new councilors, you really have to understand that if we're going to allow public access here in the city of Medford, it needs to be worked on. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8218.416s">And</a> now, having a $1.75 increase per month on a cable access bill that people would be paying each and every month, that's approximately $60 a year, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8227.517s">That's</a> a lot of money to people, you know, you take that it's another $60 and the Community Preservation Act It's another minimum of $165 as a rate increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8236.626s">It's</a> another 7% that's going to be taking place on your water and sewer tax bills coming out So it is going to have an effect and I I would suggest mr. President this Medford City Council go into some kind of remedial <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8250.725s">a</a> discussion as it relates to, you know, what's going on, not only with the rate increase, but, you know, how and why the city can collect this money, charge up to $5, and still not allow cable access television to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8263.014s">You</a> may want to bring the city solicitor on board on this one here to find out if, in fact, with the great increase, can they still allow, can they still continue to allow not having public access, whether it be on Channel 3 or any other channel.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8314.97s">There's</a> a value also there, too, Mr. President, of I think it's $454 or $455 million is if WHTH goes off the year, which is sort of like a sweet pot of the deal to make this thing more attractive. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8326.356s">But</a> I think the city needs to get itself involved, especially because of public access.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8546.334s">The</a> first answer is that the $450,000 that's sitting there is that's for the PEG access money. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8551.498s">So</a> if, in fact, we had a public access studio, that money would go there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8555.601s">That</a> only represents 2 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8557.983s">That's</a> 3 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8559.224s">The</a> other 2 percent goes into the general fund, and that money is being paid for employees up at the high school, which is a real question mark because there are some questions as to whether that's even legal or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8569.751s">So</a> 1 percent goes to the fire, 1 percent to the police, and 1 percent goes to public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8573.914s">That's</a> the PEG money.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8681.779s">Mr.</a> President, most recently in a newspaper story published by the local press on December 17th, superintendent Belson was quoted as saying that the district has saved money in multiple areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8691.501s">So</a> far this year, he said, it is also possible that the position will be filled by an employee who already works for this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8699.35s">The</a> position he's making reference to is the new public relations potential position that the school department is now being considering. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8706.336s">But</a> I'm more concerned about his first line basically saying the district has saved money in multiple areas so far this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8711.861s">I</a> think it would be important for the school committee as well as the city council to get a review back as to just what are those multiple areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8720.889s">Also,</a> I would just like to conclude by saying the following, whether it be this or anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8725.688s">We</a> have asked for numerous occasions, and the council in the past has voted for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8729.49s">It's</a> never taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8730.951s">So</a> maybe this new school administration will take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8733.553s">But</a> at a minimum, the city council and the school committee should meet at least twice a year for the purposes of reviewing their financial wherewithals. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8739.577s">Because</a> this is kind of like a little bit disturbing, that if, in fact, we have money in multiple areas, when you have teachers there that are begging in time for school supplies, we're looking for special ed teachers, we're looking for teacher assistants in some of the schools, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8755.627s">And</a> we're having all kinds of areas here, and whether you're for or against hiring a person at $85,000 a year to be a public relations person. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8764.529s">I</a> think the first thing that needs to be considered is the teacher in the classroom, the needs of the teacher in the classroom, and the students that they have to take care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8772.134s">So</a> I think Mr. Belson owes it to the entire community of Medford, the PTOs, the PTAs, and everything else involved, that if you have multiple areas for which the school committee should be apprised of, and if they were doing their homework, they would know where these areas and how much money there is. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8786.742s">That</a> would demand a report back to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8789.593s">So</a> I would move, Mr. President, on a roll call vote to the superintendent report back into what areas that money's coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8795.714s">And</a> if it's not going to affect those areas that the money's coming out of, then what's the purpose of taking the money out? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8803.756s">Why</a> aren't you using that money to fill the positions in that area?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9396.009s">And</a> then my amendment too. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9398.651s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9787.851s">And</a> the folks were very appreciative of the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9790.133s">And</a> as a result of that, I think we're all appreciative of the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9793.115s">And</a> it would be nice to have the chief of police down here to also make public commendation recommendations as it relates to their activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9802.161s">So</a> on that, I move, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9804.062s">I'd</a> like to be invited when they come down for that one, okay?<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_1nhdBin4gl8/2025-03-21_1nhdBin4gl8.html">Medford, MA City Council - Dec. 15, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=455.591s">Mr.</a> President, and for those who might be watching and are interested in our public safety and our Medford Police Department, most recently there was an incident, a public health incident that took place in the Medford Police Department building. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=467.658s">And</a> unfortunately it was a backup and it was a sewage backup into the building, which has caused a huge contamination of probably the basement area where the cells are downstairs and a whole host of other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=481.005s">This</a> city council has been advocating for the past two years that their first priority would be for a new police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=487.75s">I</a> in my campaign for mayor advocated that a police station would be my top priority on there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=493.473s">What</a> I don't understand and what I don't see is the unfortunate need that what our method police officers go through male and female on a daily basis is not being recognized and has not been recognized for the past 28 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=506.382s">The</a> unfortunate part is simply this. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=509.277s">We</a> need a new method police station, and we need to have our public safety be brought up to par. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=513.78s">We're</a> down by at least a minimum of 10 police officers, and that's rank and file. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=518.083s">That's</a> not management or captains or lieutenants. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=520.124s">That's</a> just rank and file patrolmen. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=521.625s">You</a> know, there's a new administration coming on board, and I would hope that they're not looked at, the police department with John Desai, because maybe they didn't take the positive position in coming out and endorsing that particular person. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=534.614s">But</a> the unfortunate part is, that should not be used against them. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=538.103s">Our</a> public safety right now is at an all-time low. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=541.546s">Our</a> police cruises are at an all-time low. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=544.369s">The</a> building itself, the evidence room, and everything else that surrounds the Medford Police Department on a daily basis is at an all-time low. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=551.636s">It</a> needs to be addressed now. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=552.977s">It</a> cannot wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=554.358s">Public</a> safety in our community cannot be put on hold, and it should not be put on hold. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=558.842s">And</a> I would hope that anyone who might be watching, and anyone who has an interest in public safety, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=563.223s">And</a> anyone who really believes that our Medford Police Department deserves better, because that's what our taxes are paying for, now is the time to come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=570.508s">You</a> have a new administration coming on. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=572.089s">You</a> have two new Councilors coming on. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=573.87s">The</a> commitment has to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=575.631s">The</a> finances has to be looked out for and sought out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=578.453s">And</a> they can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=579.274s">Malden</a> is a perfect example. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=580.975s">They're</a> building a brand new police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=583.256s">They</a> already have $9 million of the $18 million they've already secured in grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=587.699s">Medford</a> cannot be put on hold any longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=590.362s">in</a> regards to its police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=592.324s">And</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I would hope that this city council and the incoming city council holds new administration's feet to the fire to build that brand-new police station in behalf of not only the citizens of this community, but because of the public safety that is necessary and it's demanding right now on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=611.842s">All</a> you have to do is talk to the police officers, talk to the chief of police, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=616.683s">and</a> ask them what they think should be done as compared to what is being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=621.064s">I</a> thank you.

href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=684.607s">Public</a> access television for which the mayor and its current administration has intentionally not allowed here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=692.09s">And</a> who's at the loss of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=693.37s">And</a> that's the cable TV subscribers. <a

href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=718.832s">During</a> the past two years, what the mayor did is he implemented a three-member committee person, three-member person committee, for the purposes of reviewing public access here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=728.317s">Coming</a> up with a concocted story, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=730.165s">that</a>

your cable bill each and every month from Verizon and Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=748.674s">We</a> had a public access meeting here for contract renewal with Comcast here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=754.577s">It</a> was another 10-year deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=757.139s">And</a> no one, not one person from the city administration, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=760.087s">Not</a> one person showed up to defend and argue on behalf of Comcast customers. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=765.572s">I,</a> along with nine other citizens, were here to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=768.634s">And</a> this isn't because we're for or against. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=771.297s">It's</a> a 10-year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=772.578s">And</a> in today's day and age, 10-year contracts are basically unheard of, especially when technology is so far advanced and it's ever-changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=780.625s">From</a> California all the way to Massachusetts, there's a combination of maybe even a collage <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=787.092s">between</a> Verizon and Comcast technicians working together, sharing their jobs together as they traverse across the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=795.178s">And</a> yes, there is a movement out there that maybe public access is not the way to go because between Amazon and all these other technological programs that are out there between a combination of streaming or buying on Netflix or whatever it might be, the idea is out there that the city of Medford is not having it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=813.731s">With</a> a proposal now that seems to be languishing, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=816.642s">of</a> possibly putting it up in the vocational school, a place that would serve no purpose, especially in the winter months that we have right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=824.445s">It's</a> dark out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=825.625s">The</a> bus route would stop the person getting off at the bottom of the hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=828.727s">You</a> would have to walk up to the top of the hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=830.527s">God</a> knows where you would have to go into the building to get in. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=833.728s">It</a> does not serve a purpose because all this type of information on public access needs to be located in a centrally located place. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=842.552s">And</a> when you have something that's centrally located, it would bring more people. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=846.645s">City</a> of Reading, Town of Reading, perfect example. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=849.507s">Not</a> only do they have it in the downtown area, they have it on every Saturday morning at 11 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=854.051s">It's</a> open to the public, coffee and donuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=855.992s">People</a> can come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=857.053s">They</a> show you how to make your own program. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=858.734s">They</a> lease out, rent out their equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=861.076s">They</a> show you how to use the equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=862.397s">They</a> show you how to make your own programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=864.519s">I</a> know we've had this discussion before over and over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=867.541s">But</a> the fact of the matter is when we started this discussion, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=870.379s">There</a> was nowhere near $450,000 sitting in the coffers downstairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=875.463s">And</a> when in fact some of that money was used to pay for salaries of three individuals up at the high school in a program out there that has nothing to do and has nothing to do by law with cable access and public TV access here in the city of Medford, and nothing's been challenged in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=890.553s">What</a> needs to be done in this city is that you need a revolution in thought where people can turn around and say, hey, wait a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=898.193s">These</a> are your dollars that are being taken out of your cable bill each and every month. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=903.077s">It's</a> almost like coming out of your check. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=905.059s">You're</a> paying for something that you're not getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=906.9s">$450,000</a> is nothing to sneeze at, and you still have nothing for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=912.604s">It's</a> unfortunate that we have to talk about this thing over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=916.107s">It's</a> like the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=917.508s">There's</a> a problem out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=918.948s">It's</a> being discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=920.309s">It</a> needs to be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=921.569s">It</a> needs to be revolutionized to the point it needs change. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=926.031s">New</a> council coming in, new administration coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=928.712s">I</a> hope the change takes effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=930.933s">But</a> the people, you, the taxpayers out there, you're paying for this each and every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=935.434s">And</a> you need to hold every one of the councils accountable, as well as the mayor, to make sure that your tax dollars, your cable bills, your water bills, anything that revolves around you paying for something in this community, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=947.363s">for</a> a service or a tax or a bill is being accounted for and spent wisely. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=951.806s">I</a> would hope, and I'll leave this as a thought rather than asking or putting the council on the spot, I would hope as a thought that the incoming city council does not allow this to continue to go on, that you come up and step up forward in demand of the new city administration, that you want cable access television here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=974.702s">That's</a> what the people have paid for. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=976.802s">If</a> not, give them the $450,000 back and figure out another way to do business here because it's absolutely wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=982.566s">It's</a> almost stealing people's money and not doing what they're supposed to be doing with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=987.509s">And</a> that is just so wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=989.571s">You</a> don't tell our kids when you're making them grow up, this is the way life is supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=994.674s">You</a> pay for something you're not getting or you take something that you don't deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=998.677s">That's</a> exactly what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1000.859s">The</a> city has taken your money that they don't deserve because they're not doing anything with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1005.041s">And</a> at the same time, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1006.102s">You're</a> paying for something that you're not getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1008.703s">It's</a> a no-win situation for you, the ratepayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1011.905s">So</a> with that being said, I would hope, Mr. President, and Rick, I know next year, I'm assuming if the deal is the way the deal is supposed to be, you as the president of the council, you would be able to tell, you know, this is where we're going to go with this particular direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1026.932s">And</a> as far as that goes, Mr. President, I leave my comments as they are.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2909.681s">Mr.</a> President, one of the key components of public access television is taking place here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2915.665s">We're</a> allowing people—not allowing, this is the People's Forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2918.765s">They're</a> having the opportunity to come up and speak for whatever their positions might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2923.306s">But</a> in June of 2014, a federal judge by the name of James O. Browning made a very distinct comment as it relates to people who have the opportunity to come up and speak and to give their opinions. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2936.15s">And</a> what that federal judge did to this particular city was to punish, and I won't say use the word punish, was to admonish them for not allowing criticism to be made at a podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2948.637s">Because</a> as he said, criticism at a podium is an unconstitutional burden on free speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2954.339s">So</a> if somebody wants to come here, or a council wants to compliment, commend, or whatever it might be, or somebody wants to go to that podium and speak in such a manner, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2962.342s">But</a> criticism of any commentary is just as much important or is just as much a part of free speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2969.384s">And</a> just as Browning indicated, and he said, limits can be placed on time and topic, but not on a speaker's opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2976.787s">And</a> whatever the speaker feels he'd like to say, within reason, as long as it's not abusive, and it's his opinion, it needs to be allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2985.652s">He</a> wrote an 89-page decision, and I'm waiting for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2988.233s">I</a> asked for the 89-page decision on that, because that's a huge issue right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2992.636s">Freedom</a> of speech, and allowing freedom of speech, and inclusive of freedom of speech, if there's a criticism included in there, and they're saying it, and it's done in fair commentary, it should not be excluded. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3006.808s">and</a> it should not be cut off. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3007.889s">As</a> a matter of fact, this whole decision by the judge banned a particular city council from imposing critiques on anyone who was speaking there. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3017.876s">So</a> I believe it's monumental. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3019.497s">It</a> goes back to June of 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3022.619s">It's</a> a federal justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3023.599s">It's</a> not even a local justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3025.04s">It's</a> a federal district court justice making his opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3028.343s">And</a> that's the second time within the year 2014 that two federal judges came out <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3035.161s">and</a> made this commentary as it relates to free speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3037.863s">And</a> those who might want to critique or be critical of somebody speaking or whatever the commentary might be, as he said, quote, it's an unconstitutional burden on free speech by disallowing someone to voice their opinion, be it in a critique manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3051.735s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3171.209s">The</a> case was very succinct and it was not allowing people to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3175.311s">The</a> council <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3176.534s">in</a> its wisdom, decided council president, for whatever the reasons might be, did not allow people to make negative comments, to say anything negative at council meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3185.442s">And</a> that, in and of itself, was an unconstitutional burden on free speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3189.945s">Whether</a> it was a council rule or the actions that were taking place, it found itself all the way to the Supreme Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3196.191s">Strike</a> that, the Federal District Court, by Justice Browning. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3199.932s">So</a> I guess a word to the wise is sufficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3202.353s">Whether</a> it's a ruling or not a ruling, or just not allowing anyone, for whatever the reasons might be, not to make a commentary contrary to what was being said, it's not allowable. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3212.235s">It's</a> an exercise against free speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3215.836s">And</a> the ruling is very succinct.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3736.97s">Chair</a> recognizes Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3738.652s">On</a> the raised crosswalks, now we just got through putting one on Winthrop Street a couple of years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3742.607s">And</a> you could drive down that street right now and go over it so that there's nothing to indicate other than a sign or a thing on a pole. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3752.139s">Cars</a> go down that street kind of like fast. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3753.842s">I</a> saw a bus the other day almost do a pretty good, pretty high jump going over that speed bump. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3759.349s">Maybe</a> they should paint that thing yellow. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3761.722s">with</a> that special paint, so to let people know that there is a speed bump that they're approaching. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3765.423s">Because</a> if you're driving down the street on any given day, and if anybody knows anything about Winthrop Street, when the sun is out in the morning, it's very, very hard to differentiate how the road is coming and the traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3775.606s">It's</a> all enough, it's public safety going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3777.867s">So</a> I would make a suggestion that that public, that speed bump, or what do you call it, the raised sidewalk, be painted in yellow, bright iridescent yellow, so people realize that they're coming up to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3787.79s">That's</a> right in front of the church over there.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3800.121s">They</a> have special paint for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3801.262s">Mr.</a> President.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_uGSqTk1i0kA/2025-03-21_uGSqTk1i0kA.html">Medford City Council - Dec. 8, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=600.092s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=604.313s">Can</a> we incorporate the comments of the prior two speakers? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=608.785s">and</a> have on the suspension, bring in the paper for the purposes of tonight of making the request for sending the tax rate.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=629.621s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1075.966s">Point</a> before we get into that, uh, Mr. O'Neill point of information for the assessor before you start suddenly. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1087.257s">You</a> were asked last week to forward us information. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1090.078s">You</a> indicated there was 1,569 parcels of land that are over the $580,000 assessed value. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1098.7s">And</a> we asked for a breakdown of that 580 going up in increments of $50,000 per piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1105.642s">We</a> never got that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1387.035s">So...</a> Just a point of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1389.337s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1390.618s">As</a> you're making this assumption that the values, as they go up significantly, even if you took a house that's valued at $800,000, they're going to get an increase of $202. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1400.345s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1402.781s">over</a> and beyond whatever the tax rate's gonna be. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1405.243s">But</a> if you go to a house that's only valued at $400,000, they're gonna get a decrease of 161.91.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1418.814s">I</a> wouldn't want anyone to think that the same type of value going up doesn't correspond to the devaluation going down, because there is merit that goes both ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1427.981s">It's</a> quite obvious that under the 580, going backwards, <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1431.209s">and</a> lower amount, the rate is even higher giving back than going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1436.452s">And</a> if you're only talking about 1,569 votes, you know, to me, I think this is an important time to really take into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1444.255s">Maybe</a> it's about time we start looking at this and giving rate payers in this community a break because, you know, they're just going to get saddled now with the CPA tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1453.3s">You</a> know, whether you voted for it or not, every house is going to get stuck with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1456.661s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1457.062s">Fiscal</a> 17 for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1458.062s">Pardon</a> me? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1458.883s">Fiscal</a> 17. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1460.285s">But</a> they're still going to get stuck with it for five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1463.387s">And</a> for the next five years, they're going to be stuck with a tax that, whether you voted for it or against it, you're going to be stuck with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1470.511s">So</a> I think if there's a way to look at a break here for the homeowners, it's giving that exemption, whether it's 10, 15, or 20%. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1476.995s">And</a> I'm leaning toward that, because I think if you can afford a house that's $800,000, <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1484.224s">You</a> can afford to pay maybe another couple hundred dollars more a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1489.209s">I</a> don't know how many houses in the city are worth $800,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1492.954s">So</a> you've got 1,569 houses broken down from 580 going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1498.42s">You've</a> got 9,000 and something from 580 going backwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1503.005s">And</a> it sort of tells me that the majority should rule in something like this.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2397.918s">Mr.</a> President, Mr. O'Neill, on this handout that you gave us, you used a tax rate of $11.19, but then you went over to, with the residential exemption, you increased the tax rate to $12.10. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2408.405s">Now,</a> why'd you do that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2486.215s">Why</a> can't the council do, let's just say we talked for hypothetical. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2491.018s">We</a> take the 10% exemption and at the, at the same time, can we go after non owner occupied residences and charge them at a higher rate?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2527.144s">But</a> I'm talking about an out-of-towner that owns multiple pieces of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2533.248s">So</a> where do they fit into this? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2534.469s">You</a> can't call them.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2537.251s">If</a> you adopt hypothetically, how come other cities and towns can charge a higher rate?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2592.367s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2592.688s">So</a> for example, the, the average right now, if we tack the 1119, the average house is going to go up approximately $130. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2601.891s">Is</a> that what you're saying?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2622.21s">And</a> how much would it be if it was the $12.10? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2624.211s">It</a> wouldn't be $130. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2627.052s">How</a> much would it be?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2636.535s">No,</a> no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2638.036s">The</a> average house you said is 340.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2643.934s">So</a> what's 424 at 1119 and 424 at 1210?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2662.54s">Do</a> the 10%.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2672.051s">So</a> then these numbers are incorrect.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2723.581s">Do</a> we have anything on the books right now that designates a condominium in the city of Medford from a two family house being converted over?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2738.154s">It</a> talks about a two or three family house into a condominium. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2742.718s">Uh,</a> like a moratorium to, no, we have any kind of law that addresses this in the city.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2751.104s">So</a> you would know nothing unless you get something from the registry of deeds?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2756.086s">So</a> you would get nothing from the registry? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2758.366s">Unless</a> you got it from the registry of deeds, people could be living in two houses, condo in and out, and the city would not know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2771.231s">So</a> where are they going to record it?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2797.188s">But</a> the city has nothing on the books right now that addresses legally.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2802.833s">We're</a> going back for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2803.994s">This</a> has been going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2804.795s">We</a> still have nothing officially on the books that talks about two, three and four family houses being converted to condominiums, other than if they're bought and sold and you get the information from the register.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2856.176s">So</a> for example, if I owned a house, two family house, and I wanted to sell the second floor, first time selling. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2864.4s">But</a> I work out a deal with the tenant, I mean the person upstairs, so it won't be recorded as a condo and be assessed at a higher rate than if it was a regular two family house.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2878.524s">So</a> the city's only assessing that piece of property as a rental piece of property.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4136.593s">Mr.</a> O'Neill, question? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4142.514s">With</a> the change in the tax rate to $11.19 from last year to this year, <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4146.255s">What's</a> the net dollar amount increase that the city will be gaining with this new tax rate?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4217.912s">You</a> just said you can read the whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4219.213s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4219.813s">I</a> am on page 2.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4223.696s">And</a> on page 2, I don't have what you have.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4228.479s">Is</a> this 2? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4231.481s">Ed.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4232.122s">What</a> does it look like? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4232.942s">Are</a> you sure it's 2?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4242.984s">What</a> was he talking about?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4247.065s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4253.568s">Yeah,</a> he doesn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4259.13s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4268.611s">You</a> can barely see him.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4297.402s">But</a> what's the actual difference in from last year? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4300.503s">Are</a> we raising $2 million, $3 million, $4 million? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4302.444s">$4,350,000</a> in the levy.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4337.863s">So</a> you're saying from last year to this year, with the tax rate that you have set, it's going to be $4,350,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4342.386s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4342.586s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4343.086s">And</a> will Councilor Lungo-Koehn has <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4346.731s">alluding</a> to that if we knock off a million dollars of that, that brings it down to $3,350,000, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4354.294s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4354.895s">And</a> on an annual basis, it's historical for the last 6.7 years that we've had nothing less than a million dollars left over in free cash each and every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4364.699s">We're</a> close to $7 million in free cash, Ann? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4368.16s">How</a> much do we have in free cash right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4373.609s">Oh</a> 9.6 9.6 million in free cash, mr. Councilor so Why should we want to keep? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4382.734s">Beating</a> up the method taxpayer if they knew that they have such large reason we're making the city rich Without doing anything about it and the taxpayers are paying for it Now when we talk about having a 10% exemption to get whatever the exemption might be 10 15 or 20 percent the fact of the matter is <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4401.634s">If</a> you're saying that $580,100 is the cutoff point and bringing it forward up to $1.2 million, it's an increase of $566.09. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4410.522s">I</a> don't know how many people in this city own a house for $1.2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4415.006s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4416.447s">I</a> know a lot of people own maybe between $580,000 to $700,000, and that may be nothing more from $1.98 to $111 more per year. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4421.612s">But</a> if we follow the mindset that why do we keep <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4429.225s">If</a> we can reduce that limit by even another million dollars and knowing you're going to be getting the million dollars in in June, as we have historically for the last seven years, it makes sense at least to give the taxpayers some kind of a break, even if you were to try this thing out for a year to see where we're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4446.312s">It</a> makes no, you've had 29 years in a row of tax rate increases here in the city and you have the same problems now, if not larger now than you've had before. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4455.215s">You</a> have a police department that's understaffed by 10 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4457.815s">You</a> have an office of community development that's one and a half people. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4460.996s">You</a> have a city hall building that's in deplorable, disgusting shape when you walk out into the corridors and you go into the men's room and the ladies' room. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4468.139s">You</a> have a ceiling ready to come down on top of you that's running almost three years growing. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4473.321s">And</a> we talk about the wonderful financial thing that Moody says we have a great bond rating. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4477.803s">And</a> to paraphrase Mr. Capucci and Mr. Viglione, the fact of the matter is, what are we having all this money for if we're not spending the taxpayers' money? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4486.897s">just</a> so the city can look good, and a Moody's bond rating. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4491.919s">I'd</a> rather spend the money and have the city look better, knowing that the taxpayers' money is being used. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4497.661s">And</a> if we can work out, if we can start to figure out now, whether it's this year or next year, that you develop a tax exemption, a residential exemption, that can work, then we should be doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4508.265s">We</a> shouldn't be just saying, well, we're going to take what we've done in the past, go to 1.175%, and give it the lowest residential factor. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4515.186s">If</a> we were going to give it the lowest residential factor possible, then there should be no tax rate increase at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4521.612s">We've</a> got all this money sitting in the bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4524.555s">Why</a> would you want to go out there and bang the taxpayer anywhere from $135 up for whatever? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4532.022s">The</a> problem, as I see it, Mr. O'Neill and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4535.085s">Baker</a> and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4536.166s">Miller,</a> is there's been absolutely no discussion with this council <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4540.557s">This</a> legislative body, as it relates to prior to you folks setting a tax, having any discussion on how to change some of these things, having any discussion on when I'm going to Beacon Hill, bringing our state reps and senators in to say, what can we do to play with this thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4556.931s">We</a> haven't had at least strike. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4558.452s">I'll</a> speak for myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4559.693s">I</a> have never been asked once. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4560.854s">I</a> have called, but I have never been asked once to be part of a circle of discussion on any of these tax rate increases or proposals or whatever they might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4569.642s">even</a> to get into the merit of tax rate exemptions, even to get into the non-owner-occupier who comes into this community, and we have to give them the service of fire, police, public works, and sometimes even schooling. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4583.21s">For</a> what? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4583.951s">So</a> the Medford taxpayer winds up paying for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4586.212s">The</a> guy who legitimately pays his taxes each and every year winds up paying for all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4591.896s">And</a> for 29 years in a row, the tax rate in this community has increased under the President's administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4598.179s">And</a> what do we still have? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4599.372s">We</a> still have a deplorable infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4602.215s">We</a> have water and sewer concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4604.277s">We</a> have a public building here that needs, that's historically, you know, it needs a lot of help. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4610.144s">You</a> have a police department and a fire department that needs all kinds of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4614.303s">And</a> then what do we have, as Councilor Longo just alluded to, you have a school department still creating more jobs as they did last night, $85,000 for a brand new position to have a public relations person. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4625.43s">That's</a> what the superintendent gets $160,000 for, to do the public relations. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4630.073s">And</a> then you can't find enough teachers to teach a class because we don't have enough money in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4634.116s">And</a> then we're starting to think about maybe security in the buildings because it's now becoming an ongoing problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4639.309s">But</a> when teachers don't have enough pencils, and teachers don't have enough books, and they don't have enough classroom help, and PTOs are always asking for support from the administration, and this is the fifth, sixth job that they've created in the last year that's in excess of $85,000 to $90,000 a year, and we still cannot have that resolved to the point that it's political patronage. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4660.807s">That's</a> all that it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4662.328s">It's</a> not educational patronage. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4664.089s">It's</a> political patronage, and it's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4666.892s">And</a> hopefully this new administration comes in and recognizes this, because it's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4671.294s">It</a> serves no purpose for the value and the quality of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4675.515s">Those</a> jobs don't add anything to Moody's bond rating. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4678.816s">You</a> know what they add to? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4679.957s">They</a> add to people saying you can't beat City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4682.518s">They're</a> all in bed with each other, and every politician is crooked. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4685.999s">That's</a> what they say, because you can't beat City Hall with nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4690.06s">We're</a> trying to, slowly but surely. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4692.261s">I</a> thought it was going to take place, but it didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4694.524s">But</a> when we have a tax rate that's ready to go and set to go, and we know we're sitting on almost $9 million in free cash, $7.5 million in your water and sewer account, and there's still no plan in front of you, and you're still not part of the program, then there's something wrong around here. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4710.247s">Something's</a> terribly wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4711.427s">And</a> I hope the taxpayers wake up and finally realize that they've got to come to this real, and they have to talk about it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4982.121s">Councilor,</a> you're all set?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5261.843s">Um,</a> Ed, I don't think he answered the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5265.964s">The</a> question is simply this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5267.504s">If</a> we would have just leave the rate the same as it was last year with no increase, what would it be?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5359.541s">But</a> the question could be answered, that if you were going to, since the assessed values have gone up from last year to this year, and to keep everything to be the, I mean.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5374.47s">It</a> can't stay the same, the values have gone up. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5376.752s">So</a> if the values have gone up and you kept it at last year's rate, wouldn't that still cover you for the budget?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5386.396s">There's</a> nothing in the law that says you have to go to the max. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5389.057s">That's</a> correct.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5394.098s">So</a> all the council Longo was trying to propose was if you took, if you knocked off a million dollars, which is a million off of the $4 million and you're going to be getting that money back in June anyway, when free cash is certified, you'd have a better understanding of how this budget, you know, works better for the taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5413.443s">I'll</a> defer it to Louise Miller.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5451.196s">But</a> the council, I think we agree with that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5454.698s">We</a> have $9.6 million in free cash, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5457.4s">That</a> is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5457.84s">We</a> have $9.6 million in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5459.802s">And</a> if you folks were, if the council were agreeable to knock the million dollars off, if in fact the worst thing that could happen, if you couldn't meet your debt obligation, when June, the end of May, June comes, you still have free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5472.833s">to</a> balance out whatever needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5475.113s">So</a> all Councilor Lungo-Koehn was trying to do, if I understand it correctly, was to knock off a million dollars right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5480.514s">And</a> if it works, all things being equal, there would be the tax rate increase, would be by 40% less, instead of 130 on the house for 424, it would be $70 or $60. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5491.516s">It</a> isn't like you're wiping it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5494.317s">You're</a> just keeping all things being equal. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5496.917s">You</a> know, a few years back, it was Councilor Marks to his credit. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5500.038s">The</a> only one that didn't vote <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5501.74s">to</a> take the money out of the Water and Sewer account because the mayor underfunded the budget by a million one. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5506.764s">And</a> they took the money out of the Water and Sewer account and you had to go to the legislature for a special act of the legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5512.327s">And</a> no one else ever did it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5514.209s">No</a> other city in town in there would ever do it again, because that was the wrong thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5518.692s">But</a> we're sitting on nine and a half million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5521.614s">Why</a> is the city so reluctant to try out something and see where it takes us? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5529.059s">No,</a> no, no, we're talking about <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5531.649s">I</a> know you're talking about it, but at the same time, I think it needs to be explained better to the point that, you know, we're not cash-strapped poor. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5539.795s">We're</a> sitting on $9.5 million, and even if we get another six or seven or rate of $900,000 this year, that will offset whatever the million dollars you're taking off the increase in the override by a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5551.544s">I</a> mean, what is so hard to understand this for? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5553.885s">I</a> don't understand.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5571.931s">You'd</a> be taking out of free cash, though, Louise, not the reserves of the water and sewer account.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5578.253s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5578.433s">That's</a> what that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5580.194s">So</a> if you have $9.5 million and it keeps increasing each and every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5582.795s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5591.637s">No,</a> we're talking about the question that he didn't answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5594.217s">What</a> would it be to keep the tax rate the same as it was last year? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5597.438s">It'd</a> be 2.4 million.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6093.076s">Question,</a> Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6097.544s">On</a> the line there where it says a substantial, who wrote this? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6101.066s">Is</a> this state wording? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6103.847s">Mr.</a> O'Neill, who wrote number three, adopt a residential exemption?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6114.733s">And</a> your letter to the council dated November 23rd, when you have the four things, it says adopt a residential exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6120.956s">Who</a> wrote the wording for these four things?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6125.86s">It's</a> dated November 25th. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6127.241s">Probably</a> I did.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6140.429s">Well,</a> I would make a suggestion that the word substantial is eliminated because it is not a substantial. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6145.893s">The</a> $1,569 doesn't compare anywhere to $9,000, close to $10,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6147.714s">And</a> it gives the impression that <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6152.311s">a</a> substantial number of people are going to be paying higher, because... Duly noted, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6156.853s">Pardon</a> me?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6158.454s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6159.094s">Because</a> according to what you gave us over this past weekend and tonight, you know, it's quite obvious that, you know, it's not substantial. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6168.339s">It's</a> a progression from 580 or whatever that number in the future is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6172.02s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6172.12s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6172.42s">Will</a> do.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6494.854s">On</a> the small commercial exemption, you indicate here in the wording that you shift the portion from <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6502.573s">one</a> group to another. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6504.755s">And</a> since this shift causes a higher commercial and industrial tax rate, all commercial and industrial not receiving the exemption would see an increase in their tax bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6516.244s">When</a> you use the purpose of somebody having 10 or more people and the value is less than a million dollars, they can receive the exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6526.812s">Is</a> that state statute that says that? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6528.654s">That's</a> correct, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6531.121s">So</a> how many of these properties exist in the city of Medford?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6552.387s">No,</a> no, no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6553.327s">In</a> Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6554.147s">Yep,</a> yep. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6554.747s">How</a> many people does this affect?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6602.533s">So</a> you're saying that there's 450 small businesses that would be eligible for this, correct?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6617.078s">72</a> owner occupies, that would be 10 or less people, 450 that have the small business. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6622.66s">So</a> how many of the ones over that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6816.764s">Quick</a> question. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6817.564s">When</a> you came before us for the budget, how come this wasn't introduced? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6821.085s">You</a> knew what the dollar amount was going to be.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6827.426s">So</a> is this bid going to cover us until when?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6840.728s">So</a> does this dollar amount start from January, <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6844.105s">of</a> this year and then goes to June and then start to jump the end of July.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7211.267s">Ed.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7212.849s">You</a> just said that the money's used, it's put in the overlay surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7218.545s">Is</a> this accumulated each and every year? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7220.527s">Is</a> it carryover money?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7245.164s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7246.165s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7247.316s">Historically,</a> what does the city usually pay out in this account during the course of a year?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7285.143s">So</a> what's the dollar amount, so the people can hear it?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7293.148s">It</a> goes into the recap and then it goes into the surplus.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7321.577s">Well,</a> I don't understand if Louise, you just got through saying that this, when council Max asked the question that this has nothing to do with our bond rating, but now all of a sudden, <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7331.246s">This</a> can be taken out, I think, if you said by the executive of the community, in use for other city expenses, which is a direct reflection upon the budget.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7355.286s">Or</a> the mayor can make a request to take it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7358.608s">OK,</a> so when you take a vote on, you say yes to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7360.929s">It</a> now goes into a budgetary item, correct?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7364.651s">So</a> if it's appropriated for a budgetary item, then why wouldn't that, in and of itself, the surplus in and of itself, be considered part of a bond rating? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7371.974s">Because</a> what if you had no money in there at all? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7373.775s">What</a> would you do?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7381.318s">What</a> would you do?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7402.289s">But</a> how do you accumulate a $490,000 balance right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7404.269s">So</a> it's probably—it would be $720,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7405.45s">As</a> of right now, tonight, before this vote, there's $720,000 in that account. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7407.711s">How</a> much do you— No, no, no.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7425.748s">You</a> just said there's $490,000 left.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7433.133s">After</a> this $250,000 goes out.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7455.529s">It</a> doesn't go into an overlay surplus.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7459.511s">So</a> why would that be part of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7461.132s">You're</a> waiting to collect on real estate taxes.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7485.734s">Louise,</a> you mentioned in the community, the whole that, you know, you're going to be having some new financial restructuring and consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7492.015s">You</a> have two new councils coming on. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7494.296s">I</a> think it would be beneficial to have the entire council sit down and understand some of this because <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7500.1s">This</a> can be confusing, and at the same time, it becomes contradictory, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7503.701s">You</a> can't have a real estate account that's going to put money in there, which is part of the general fund, and then once the money goes into the overlay surplus, it's not to be considered part of, you know, Standard Moody's, you know, standard. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7514.385s">I</a> understand this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7518.066s">It's</a> moving money around. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7519.266s">It's</a> the old shell game, huh?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7766.71s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7767.61s">Um,</a> most recently, uh, last week we had a situation here. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7771.011s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7771.886s">where</a> a commentary was made by one of my colleagues, who's not here tonight, as it relates to he wanted to congratulate somebody for his recent appointment within a union position. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7783.37s">And</a> that's all well and good. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7785.151s">And</a> I tried to give my opinion as to why I didn't think it was a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7790.213s">And</a> my commentary was somewhat repressed by you sitting in the chair, Mr. President, because, you know, it's my right to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7797.347s">We</a> have every one of these Councilors over here, men and women, give resolutions on any one given Tuesday night as it relates to who they want to congratulate and what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7806.475s">And</a> if somebody has a different point of view, that likewise should be entertained. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7810.819s">I</a> wasn't speaking on behalf of anyone but myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7814.302s">And</a> while somebody is being praised for their promotion, I just did not feel it was correct because that same one person who you were praising for his promotion was the same person. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7823.25s">who</a> went into a municipal building and lied and told mistruths about me during this past campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7828.971s">And</a> I didn't think that was true. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7830.191s">And</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7831.031s">And</a> I think the people ought to know this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7832.812s">If</a> you're going to take advantage of sitting here and trying to acknowledge someone, you need to take the opposite side if somebody has a different point of view. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7840.553s">There</a> are people that come before this podium that try to express themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7843.894s">And</a> sometimes they get shut off. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7845.174s">Sometimes</a> they're ignored. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7846.654s">And</a> sometimes they're being told enough is enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7849.274s">You</a> know, this is the only forum in the entire community of Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7852.798s">that</a> people have an opportunity to come and speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7855.26s">You</a> have a newspaper that's a week late, and that doesn't serve any purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7860.224s">You</a> also have a school committee that meets biweekly, and sometimes that doesn't serve any purpose, because by the time you get the news after the fact, whatever takes place has already been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7870.911s">But</a> whether you agree or disagree with the purpose of that podium, it's there to allow the people to come and speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7877.536s">And</a> my commentary last week was, I did not vote for <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7882.738s">Nor</a> would I approve of commending anybody who gets a promotion in their union job, who took advantage of his position, to come and bash another elected official. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7893.626s">I</a> just think it was wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7895.647s">I'm</a> a big boy, and I can stand here, and I can take any abuse that anyone wants to give. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7899.831s">But</a> when they lie and distort the truth and misrepresent, and they get promoted on those principles, that's not the principles of hard and good work. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7908.397s">That's</a> just the principles of somebody <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7910.308s">who</a> is just a bad person, as far as I'm concerned, as it relates to them doing a job that they did not do well.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7919.954s">Well,</a> my character was addressed by that gentleman that you voted for, that you wanted to commend, Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7926.318s">So</a> if you don't like it, then you shouldn't have voted for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7928.519s">And</a> we're free to not vote for the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7929.6s">And</a> probably it shouldn't have been here. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7931.161s">Are</a> we going to commend and congratulate every single person in this community that gets a promotion in their job or graduates from a college? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7939.457s">Are</a> we going to do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7940.177s">We</a> might as well start doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7941.838s">There's</a> a lot of people who are left out, who live in side streets, main streets, up in the hillside, West Method, South Method, in your own neighborhood, who are wonderful people and they've done great things here in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7952.524s">Never</a> see them getting commended and congratulated. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7955.385s">But</a> when you go out of your way to pick a particular person, to congratulate that person who intentionally went out of their way to attack a councilor by <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7964.574s">saying</a> untruths, mistruths, and lies. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7967.556s">I</a> am never going to sit here and let that get by on anyone, whether I agreed with you or disagreed. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7972.458s">I</a> would be defending your position, Councilor De La Russa. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7975.219s">I</a> wouldn't let anybody do that to you, especially if I knew it was untruth and it was a lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7979.982s">Having</a> a difference of opinion is one thing, but telling a lie I will not stand for. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7985.985s">Listen,</a> I've served 39 years as an elected official in this community, and there isn't one person that will be able to come to that rail and say I lied about them. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7993.542s">I</a> lied about what I was doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7995.343s">I</a> don't believe in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7996.143s">I</a> don't have to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7997.684s">And</a> I don't need to have that done to me as it was in this past campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8001.606s">And</a> I don't need to have people think that that's what took place, when, in fact, it did take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8007.149s">So</a> you can sit there all you want, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8009.11s">And</a> I would hope next year, whoever sits in that chair — I think it's your turn, Rick, to sit in the chair — I would hope whoever sits in that chair, if it's you, you allow people to come and speak, and you'll let them know what the truth is. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8019.925s">Because</a> that's the only forum in the city of Medford that allows somebody here to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8024.648s">Try</a> to go to City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8025.888s">Try</a> to go meet with the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8027.289s">Get</a> to the four secretaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8028.91s">Good</a> luck to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8029.61s">And</a> try to get your opinion expressed around here. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8031.992s">It's</a> right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8032.752s">There's</a> the podium where it all begins and where it ends. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8034.913s">And</a> hopefully that stays that way because that's the people's forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8038.325s">And</a> that's what we're getting paid to do, to represent the people, not to represent ourselves and to give out jobs and take care of each other with political appointments. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8046.173s">No,</a> that's not what we're here for. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8047.555s">That's</a> not what I'm here for. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8049.117s">And</a> I will never ever allow anyone in this community to stand there and lie about me in public or in private, knowing when it's false, it's not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8057.085s">And</a> I would stand here and defend any one of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8059.686s">And</a> those sitting on that community, out in that audience, because that's not the way government should be run. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8064.307s">If</a> you want to win an election, do it the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8066.527s">Do</a> it the honest way. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8068.188s">Don't</a> go in there and lie about someone to try to generate votes, because that's what took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8073.609s">You</a> can say all you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8075.269s">You</a> can say all you want about the resolution that Mr. Knight and the gentleman that he wanted to congratulate last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8081.47s">But</a> I don't buy it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8082.251s">I</a> don't accept it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8083.391s">And</a> I think it was a terrible, terrible act that that gentleman committed here in the city of Medford, trying to con <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8089.985s">union</a> members into this community, making them believe bad things about me during this past campaign, and I will not stand for it, and I do not accept it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8737.784s">Mr.</a> President, the matter was simply this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8739.685s">There</a> are not too many of these folks that work in the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8744.227s">I</a> don't think they've seen a raise in eight to nine years. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8746.728s">Um,</a> our superintendent, <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8748.86s">If</a> the budget turned around, he said he would investigate it, look into it, and if they needed to get one, strike that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8754.704s">If</a> that be the case, that he would take care of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8757.045s">Well,</a> nothing's been taken care of as we speak here tonight, other than a new $90,000 job being given out to the school committee last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8765.47s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8782.596s">No,</a> that's not true either, because if that be the case, there's been no communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8786.739s">This</a> thing will strike that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8787.98s">I've</a> got the floor, Paul, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8789.582s">The</a> superintendent was going to the floor.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8794.667s">Pardon</a> me, sir? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8795.107s">Say</a> that again? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8795.768s">Say</a> it again louder. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8796.488s">I</a> didn't hear you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8800.867s">If</a> you spoke up, maybe we could understand what's going on around here and you wouldn't be so rude. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8804.968s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8805.908s">The</a> fact of the matter is simply this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8807.348s">These</a> workers have been waiting for almost eight and a half years. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8810.549s">Can</a> you please tell him to keep quiet?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8814.57s">We'll</a> restrain ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8816.81s">This</a> has been going on for eight and a half years. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8818.371s">It</a> took place at the last budgetary hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8820.751s">Superintendent</a> Sunday was going to get back to us whether this took place last night or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8824.512s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8825.351s">Still</a> waiting for an answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8826.832s">If</a> it did, well, we could to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8828.232s">Can</a> we, did they vote this last night? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8830.973s">They</a> gave a 10% raise?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8834.835s">Pardon</a> me? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8838.077s">Can't</a> ask them a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8838.937s">They're</a> going to be your future colleagues in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8841.478s">Um,</a> two of the colleagues who are going to be on this board next year just indicated that they got a pay raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8846.38s">So</a> with that being said, I accept their acknowledgement to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8850.042s">Um,</a> they seem to be more creditable than anyone else around here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8853.377s">So</a> I thank you for that information.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8921.736s">That's</a> not what the resolution says. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8923.056s">The</a> resolution says. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8924.037s">No,</a> no, I'm talking about your dissertation. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8927.979s">Mr.</a> President, are we going to be able to speak without being interrupted? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8932.18s">Are</a> you going to rule them out of order? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8934.261s">Please.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8937.523s">Read</a> it, please.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8950.13s">And</a> that's what we talked about being reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8951.751s">And</a> as I realized until coming in here tonight and just a couple of minutes ago, nothing came across my desk telling me that they have been gotten their raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8960.618s">I</a> just asked our two new colleagues coming on in January that they got their raise last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8965.341s">So</a> I thank them for the information again for the second time. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8969.046s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8969.766s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10283.333s">Al</a> was the unassuming type of a fellow that, be it politics or sports, he was the guy, he was like the go-to guy to go to here in the city of Medford because in his early days when he worked at the Method Mercury, which happened to be the old Mystic Bakery location, he was an interesting fellow. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10301.102s">You</a> could walk into there and you'd talk about sports and you'd talk about your local politics and you would, <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10306.377s">And</a> you get a pretty good answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10307.959s">And</a> he was a pretty honest reporter. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10309.781s">And</a> he was pretty fair in how he reported. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10312.644s">But</a> the best part that I think about Al, he would always talk to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10316.429s">He</a> always, in his opinion, really meant something. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10319.332s">And</a> he was appreciative of the fact that you would take the time and either shake his hand or go to talk to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10326.265s">You</a> know, he's the type of a staple here in the city of Medford that you don't see very often, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10331.949s">And</a> unfortunately, he's no longer with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10334.43s">But</a> I would hope that his family and friends that did love him and did respect him understand that, you know, it's a part of your life. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10340.174s">It's</a> a part of our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10341.755s">And</a> as Council President Dello Russo alluded to, when he was writing for the Medford Mercury, he was a pretty fair guy, very hard to find in today's journalism. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10349.821s">And</a> so with that being said, I think we'll take a moment of silence.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_IK8caXY8nKg/2025-03-21_IK8caXY8nKg.html">Medford, MA City Council - Dec. 1, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=535.356s">At</a> our field office, at your field office. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=537.036s">And</a> that's, and that's what we had asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=538.536s">You</a> know, we'd asked for updates as it relates to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=540.817s">And</a> we never got a response back from anybody as it relates to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=544.638s">Go</a> ahead.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=632.095s">And</a> one other thing, if you can do this, um, you indicate that there are certain folks that are going to be affected and they are, if you walk around those businesses in the square, nobody has contacted them telling them of other bridge that took place a few weeks ago when you started doing some work there, the change in the time, the work, the work schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=651.259s">There's</a> gotta be more communication because you know, business the way it is, it's tough to begin with and trying to keep your doors open. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=658.0s">You</a> meet all your expenses, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=660.201s">This</a> is a huge project. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=661.121s">We</a> know that it's going to take place until 2017, but if there's no actual personal contact and conversation with the business owners, you're going to have a hard time, you know, selling the project because you're having a hard time selling it to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=675.264s">But</a> now you're telling me, and I'm glad they appreciate that people in the city are, you know, we have not gotten that response. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=680.344s">We</a> don't even know what this lady you're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=682.365s">So</a> Mr. Clerk, if we can ask, can you copy the letter? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=685.865s">We</a> don't know about this letter about the bus stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=687.906s">Just</a> hearing about it for the first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=691.588s">Do</a> you have a copy that you could give us?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=698.03s">You</a> sent it November 18th. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=701.891s">Well,</a> and who'd you address, Mr. Daly? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=704.752s">Who'd</a> you address that to? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=708.153s">Could</a> you make a copy of the letter? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=711.593s">That's</a> not the letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=712.414s">That's</a> the letter?

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=778.674s">So</a> this is their request that went out per letter, November 14th, they're looking for two week headstart. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=784.278s">We're</a> hearing about this for the very first time and where the decision makers of where that bus stop goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=792.444s">I</a> think you can understand where I'm coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=794.186s">It's</a> kind of like obvious that, you know, there's been no communication, you know, and they may just have to wait.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1045.907s">One</a> more group you might want to inform. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1047.949s">Point</a> of information, Council Member. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1049.01s">One</a> more group might be the Medford Chamber of Commerce.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1850.189s">Mr.</a> President, I think Mr... Who's the gentleman from the state? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1853.19s">Who's</a> that fellow? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1855.23s">Scott.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1855.47s">Scott,</a> please.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1894.771s">But</a> taking that into consideration, you said you listen to any and all ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1897.894s">If</a> in fact that doesn't work, you could still have those buses go right into Medford square cause we had discussed as a spot of the issue and with the square is, and they could just traverse themselves around river street and come back, which is a one way. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1909.985s">And</a> you could just reverse the one way, go on the opposite way. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1912.687s">And</a> that would make it easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1913.528s">Cause</a> don't forget you have two senior citizen buildings over there in excess of 500 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1917.592s">And</a> for them to walk any further, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1919.521s">in</a> the end of that ring road, then to cross over and go underneath the bridge, where it'd be a lot easier just to go to Mitford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1925.524s">So,</a> and again, folks that might have a handicap or a disability coming from Salem Street, Forest Street, or High Street would still be taking the same amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1933.308s">If</a> not, it would be shorter for them just to walk across the square through the crosswalks, because you said you'd be making them properly and slated to be traversed. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1942.192s">So</a> you have options that are there, and that's all that the council wanted to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1946.552s">is</a> what the options are, what would work the best, and it becomes very hard when you have no communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1951.294s">So</a> I'm just throwing that out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1953.354s">Understood.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1954.355s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1955.475s">Chair</a> recognizes Vice President Lungo-Koehn.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1989.183s">No,</a> but what's the contact?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2042.646s">And</a> one of the other things to the chair, um, you said this was going to be a six day a week double shift project.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2105.81s">That's</a> your schedule now, but I believe when you folks were here, the presentation was made, it was going to be a double shift twice a week, six days a week.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2137.57s">Well,</a> wouldn't it make more sense if you did double shifts twice a day? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2140.451s">We</a> wouldn't have to wait to 2017? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2141.611s">18,</a> excuse me.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2217.903s">I</a> don't think it advances the cause to wait to 2018 even for 121 feet.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2884.508s">Quick</a> question. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2886.068s">You're</a> saying that the 500,000 is an estimate, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2888.848s">Do</a> we have a final number?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2899.432s">So</a> is it possible that they may not accept the $500,000?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2931.636s">But</a> why haven't we heard yet? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2932.876s">Why</a> is it taking so long?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2948.41s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3046.31s">Could</a> you explain what this money is for please?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3099.591s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3101.112s">So</a> this is kind of like interesting because a couple of years ago when they were discussing the budget, when the council had asked that the money be taken from the water and sewer account, um, the water and sewer commission indicated that that wasn't their purview. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3113.738s">It</a> was up to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3115.639s">Now</a> you're saying tonight that they made a recommendation to take this money <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3119.428s">of</a> approximately $700,000 or above to go to offset the cost of our water and soil bills here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3129.792s">Don't</a> forget, I believe we get a discount, strike that, we get a wholesale discount rate from the MWRA, and then the rest of the cost relates to the city of Medford's operation, water and soil department. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3139.236s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3139.396s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3140.497s">So</a> if we take this balance, if we transfer this money, we have a balance of $7,036,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3144.738s">$7</a> million. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3150.401s">I</a> just don't understand why they just don't take the whole thing from the water and sewer account. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3154.923s">That's</a> the taxpayer's money. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3156.244s">They'd</a> be the overpaid or whatever the account might situation might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3160.305s">That</a> would have made it a $7.7 million surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3163.206s">So</a> the amount that you're taking out right now leaves you with a balance of $7,036,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3166.568s">It's</a> the taxpayer's money, the rate payers money. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3170.449s">They</a> didn't cost, they didn't, it wasn't their charge to raise the rates, you know, and if they made a mistake somewhere along the line, as it relates to this rate structure, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3179.618s">then</a> that needs to be figured out. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3180.818s">But</a> the taxpayers should not have to pay for it, especially since this is their money that they've had there in surplus for all this amount of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3188.6s">The</a> law is very simple, as you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3190.14s">It's</a> either one or two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3191.54s">The</a> law says, unless you have something that's ready to go in a ready-made project within 90 days, or there's a surplus remaining that goes back to the rate payers. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3200.582s">Now,</a> this has been going on for a few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3202.122s">$7</a> million and $36 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3203.302s">$7</a> million, $36,000, leaving you with a balance. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3205.182s">I'm</a> going to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3209.51s">that</a> this not go through, that this money come out of the Water and Soil Enterprise account, period. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3216.712s">The</a> rate payers should not have to pay for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3218.493s">Let</a> the city figure out where they went wrong and if they have to make an adjustment. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3222.154s">Because</a> it's bad enough that they've been taxed for everything in this community from A to Z. And I just don't think it's fair, especially knowing that you have a remaining balance of $7 million and there is not one project sitting in front of us right now that has a demand of any kind of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3238.208s">that</a> the water and sewer account has for a balance. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3240.009s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3240.629s">Number</a> two, I can see leaving maybe two or $3 million in that account in case an emergency takes place. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3245.891s">We've</a> had no discussion from the city engineer, the building department or the highway department, public works department regarding a project that the city needs to undertake right now or it's going to be undertaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3258.316s">All</a> we know right now is that there is this kind of a surplus sitting there. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3262.498s">It's</a> unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3263.999s">I</a> don't think that the rate payers should have their money that they've paid for <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3268.335s">now</a> be charged again. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3269.456s">I</a> think that money should stay in this account and the city and the city engineer and the new administration should figure out what all the INI and the water leaks and the things that need to be corrected here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3280.264s">They</a> better get on their duff real quick because this is what the administration has been talking about, whether it was myself or the incoming person, you know, this city needs to have a lot of reconstruction in this community as it relates to their water and sewer, their INI and their street and their side construction projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3297.157s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3297.902s">Take</a> this out of this account and transfer it over to pay a debt that belongs with the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3303.644s">If</a> they mismanaged and miscalculated, don't blame the taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3307.425s">They've</a> been blamed enough for what goes on in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3310.806s">I'm</a> going to move, Mr. President, that the money come out of the retained earnings of the Water and Sewer account and not be transferred.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4329.82s">Mr.</a> President, I agree with Councilor Marks and my colleague Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4333.701s">The</a> interesting part, you were at that meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4336.487s">Louise,</a> as it relates to the conservation. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4338.949s">What</a> did the commissioner say? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4339.89s">That</a> the sad part about this whole thing, the people are conserving more, but they're going to have to be paying more. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4344.975s">So</a> the ball bounces itself back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4347.036s">This</a> goes back to almost like the green barrel before you got here, the green barrel issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4351.18s">When</a> we got into these green barrels and we get into this whole idea of being conservation and recycling, and we have the two different size barrels here, but what happens here to the city of Medford because of the recycling, which cuts down on the hardcore, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4363.795s">The</a> waste that cost the city, I think it was last year, $159,000 more, because even though we were recycling more, we went from three to 30%, it still cost the city more. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4375.041s">And</a> people just need to understand something. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4378.183s">Well,</a> if you're going to use less, why are you paying more? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4383.886s">So</a> some people may get the attitude, if I'm going to pay for them, I should just use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4387.588s">So</a> the whole conservation theme, it's going to be lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4391.31s">The</a> other part of the issue is that, again, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4394.082s">It's</a> $7.7 million of tax payers, rate payers money that's been sitting there with no major projects on ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4403.708s">Nowhere,</a> nowhere to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4405.249s">And</a> the law is very succinct. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4406.75s">It's</a> either 90 days ready to go or it goes back to the rate payers. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4410.473s">Now</a> we know that there's a projected rate increase coming in this year from the MWRA. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4415.036s">Who's</a> going to eat that again? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4416.236s">It's</a> going to be the rate payers. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4417.918s">So</a> it's bad enough that they're going to have to pay for the increase to the water and sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4422.171s">system.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4422.531s">And</a> I understand you have to pay for salaries and all the contract negotiations that take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4427.253s">But</a> when you're sitting on the surplus like this, there was no reason why the rate payer, the rate payers should get involved in paying off whatever the difference might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4434.556s">Councilor</a> Marks just alluded to something a few years ago and kudos to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4438.318s">He</a> was the only council that voted against taking a million point one ballot, a million point $100,000 out of the water and sewer account to offset the mayor's budget deficit to balance his proposed budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4450.723s">And</a> he was right. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4451.673s">It</a> should have never been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4453.033s">First</a> and only time in the legislature, first and last time it's going to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4457.654s">This</a> is the rate payers' money. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4459.335s">You</a> know, it's bad enough you've got them with the Republic kiosk parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4462.815s">You</a> know, you're hitting them in every single corner here with attacks and attacks. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4468.196s">And</a> their streets, their roads, their bridges and everything is just in a state of chaos. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4473.517s">I</a> just cannot in good conscience go forward with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4476.198s">I'm</a> not going to support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4478.358s">It</a> doesn't belong. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4479.219s">It</a> doesn't belong here right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4481.16s">And</a> until the city can get its act together financially as to where it needs to go, how it needs to resolve this water and soil situation, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4488.684s">There</a> are so many options here. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4491.065s">You</a> have a consultant that tells you you're in a deficit, you gotta start saving. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4494.787s">And</a> then when you start saving, you gotta save more than what you're saving. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4498.649s">I</a> don't care about other cities and towns, and I don't care about our bond rating. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4503.271s">What</a> I care about is having taxpayers spend too much money on more than being charged for more than what's necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4510.92s">Life</a> is not too easy right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4512.901s">You</a> may hear all kinds of great stories out there about the economy. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4515.963s">People</a> are still struggling. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4517.123s">People</a> are still out there that haven't received raises in five and six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4521.166s">The</a> employees in this building and citywide and the school department, they should be thankful they have their jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4527.729s">Thankful</a> they have their jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4529.87s">And</a> they shouldn't be complaining about, you know, we're not getting enough of a percentage here. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4533.732s">They're</a> everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4534.693s">You</a> want to negotiate in good faith? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4535.993s">I've</a> got no problem in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4537.594s">But</a> don't go out and hit the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4539.173s">that</a> don't have that job security, that haven't gotten that pay raise in two or three years, and knowingly should not have to pay for this deficit that, unfortunately, was created by a miscalculation. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4550.701s">I</a> won't say it was intentional, but an unintentional miscalculation. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4553.883s">So</a> you're going to have to go back to the drawing boards and revisit it, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4558.206s">And</a> that's the best way I can say it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4560.988s">You</a> know, I don't think — you know, when this council — I think it was two budgets ago — voted $660,000 to be taken out of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4567.425s">to</a> not to absorb the water, 9% water rate increase from the MWRA that particular year. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4572.888s">The</a> mayor went nuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4573.628s">He</a> didn't like that whole idea and he chastised us and he had all kinds of press releases sent out that we were, you know, weren't good people. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4581.172s">We</a> were against the taxpayers and this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4583.254s">We</a> were for the taxpayers back then because that's what the money should have come out of. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4587.716s">And</a> unbeknownst to us, we didn't know that that 9% was taking place until the budget vote on that just before the budget was going to be proposed in that particular time. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4595.842s">Yes,</a> Louise, you gave us this ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4597.504s">I</a> got no problem with that, but I can't support it in good conscience, knowing that that kind of a deficit is sitting there and knowing and just thinking about what's going on in the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4608.774s">With</a> all the new jobs that were just created this past year, over $500,000 in new administrative jobs, a $7,000 salary increase to someone because they're retiring to give them their highest three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4621.264s">And</a> when people start hearing that and knowing that those type of salaries are going out there, and when we're sitting on $7 million of their money, and they have to pay for raising their water and sewer rates, it's unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4632.593s">It</a> doesn't fly by me, and I cannot and I will not support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4637.804s">Yeah,</a> I support that the entire money comes out of the water and sewer account. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4643.026s">But</a> he says you can't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4645.768s">I'd</a> like to amend the motion, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4647.969s">Amend</a> the main motion that the entire deficit of whatever it might be comes out of the retained earnings of the water and sewer account. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4655.772s">And</a> the amendment supersedes the main motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4660.334s">Yes,</a> you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4661.455s">It's</a> an amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4664.385s">Move</a> the question.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5832.961s">I'm</a> not supporting it tonight, but it's up to the council chair recognizes councilor Penta Louise, you, um, not you, excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5841.906s">On</a> November 4th, we received a letter from a solicitor Romley relating to this $300,000 request. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5850.251s">And</a> he indicated that the payment is for all costs incidental and related to, well, whatever incidental and related to is, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5857.355s">And</a> then he indicates, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5859.28s">that</a> it's including payments for all costs as it relates to the construction of this particular building. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5866.947s">Now,</a> that was on November 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5869.209s">You</a> give us a paper on November 25th, but prior to November 25th, which was last week, I believe some of the questions were as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5876.795s">Water</a> leaks into the building, the air conditioning and the heating system were at awry, and there were problems ongoing over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5883.341s">Now</a> you would just say that here tonight, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5885.75s">that</a> this payment is for the contractor because of the job that he did. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5890.854s">Why</a> would you be paying the contractor if you still have leaks in the building, you have an AC and a heating system still not operable? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5896.779s">The</a> building's not even a year old. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5899.702s">Isn't</a> it customary that there's always a holdback of X amount of dollars in construction contracts or projects until at least the warranty period is up?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5931.403s">How</a> much are you holding back right now?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5934.46s">You're</a> holding back, and you want another $300,000?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5940.423s">So</a> you're not holding it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5941.984s">It's</a> nowhere else in reserve out there.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5945.366s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5945.646s">So</a> therefore, we would like to believe that this $14,800,000 building was supposedly paid for, however it was paid for. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5955.571s">Now</a> we're being told that there is an environmental aspect to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5959.513s">So</a> the environmental aspect here that you're asking <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5962.512s">The</a> cost of the project for part, if not all of this money, seems to be contrary to the building paying the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5968.836s">What</a> does the contract have to do with the environmental part of it?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6021.858s">police</a> on November 4th, the letter came forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6024.519s">It</a> did not mention anything about heat, air conditioning, soil, environmental, nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6029.841s">It</a> just says for, for incidentals relative there to very generic and it makes no sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6037.204s">I'm</a> even surprised that the city solicitor would even write a letter like that without being more descriptive as it relates to why we're looking for the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6044.687s">But</a> last week I think you heard what the concerns were. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6047.14s">you</a> know, what, what, what, what some of these things are. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6050.082s">And</a> I, I just cannot believe this was Caldwell and Banker, Caldwell and Brown. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6053.405s">This</a> is Brown and Caldwell. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6054.826s">And</a> this is the same people that are in the West Medford area doing the city's parking lot over there, making an estimate of, of what should be done there.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6075.021s">And</a> that second firm,
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6078.931s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6080.593s">And</a> the $5,000 company reviewed the $100,000 company.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6083.996s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6084.337s">Well,</a> that makes a lot of sense, but that's beside the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6087.64s">I</a> am not going to support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6088.881s">This</a> does not make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6090.283s">There</a> is no reason in here as to why we should even be going forward with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6094.387s">And</a> if, in fact, they ran into a problem because they couldn't figure out <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6098.53s">In</a> the landfill, I mean, how deep did they go? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6101.952s">Is</a> it their requirement? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6103.573s">How</a> deep did they go? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6104.273s">Do</a> you know?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6111.937s">So</a> if they went as deep as they had to go? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6113.838s">Yes,</a> to clean up the entire contamination. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6116.039s">And</a> why is all this coming up now as a cost factor?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6132.605s">The</a> actual cost you said is $975,000.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6137.868s">But</a> now it's going to be another $300,000 over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6139.228s">No,</a> the $300,000 for the entire project.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6232.942s">Can</a> we get the questions regarding the leaks in the building and the air conditioning and the heating and everything else? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6238.125s">There</a> must be a punch list of things to do.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6613.023s">Chair</a> recognizes Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6614.604s">Mr.</a> President, I, I, Louise, I'm somewhat confused here right now because <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6619.064s">You're</a> asking for $350,000 to close out the project, but you're also suing the contractor.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6628.507s">You're</a> suing the engineering firm? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6629.928s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6630.268s">So</a> you're paying $350,000 to the contractor because you're alleging, or they're alleging, that there was additional rock that had to be removed.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6640.792s">And</a> it cost $171,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6641.092s">And</a> the duck bank thing and $72,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6647.402s">detail.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6647.982s">Where</a> was the city's person on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6649.524s">Did</a> the city from the engineer's office have a person on this job? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6653.206s">Yes,</a> we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6654.947s">Well,</a> didn't they anticipate this? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6656.228s">If</a> when they first started up on Winthrop street and got to the rotary, it was all rock going up and it was all rock going forward.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6691.81s">You're</a> saying the engineering firm did not do what the contractor said or vice versa?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6704.904s">But</a> while that's going on, but where was the city's person to say, what are you doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6708.507s">You</a> can't do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6709.828s">You're</a> not following the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6712.87s">Why</a> did they go through all this? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6714.872s">Almost</a> $300,000, $350,000 before they realized that they didn't do what they were supposed to do.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6732.032s">But</a> as the project was being continued, where was the update from the city or from the person from the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6738.217s">This</a> looks like it's all now after the fact, because once they got to the rotary there at Winthrop circle and they started to go forward on Winthrop street, further to the high school, that's when they hit all that ledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6748.345s">That</a> is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6748.966s">Continuously,</a> continuously. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6750.427s">And</a> we never got any updates on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6752.308s">And</a> we never got any kind of notification as it related to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6755.431s">Where</a> was the city's person from the engineer's office? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6758.713s">Cassandra</a> never told us about this.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6785.071s">So</a> even though the contractor did all the work, was there a budget for the contractor?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6791.43s">Was</a> there an overrun in the budget for the contractor?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6795.293s">Now</a> that was his overrun. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6796.754s">Was</a> there a specific dollar amount? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6798.235s">And</a> once that dollar amount was met, it had to be renegotiated or was it an open end overrun?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6855.244s">So</a> this is the same contract that we were going to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6857.704s">If</a> I remember correctly, it was Councilor Knighthill alluded to way back when that they were putting this stuff all over the sidewalks and in front of people's homes and their trucks were all over the place and the green pipes were all up and down the street, but no penalty. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6873.188s">I</a> just don't understand how you can have a contract that doesn't have a penalty clause in there over and beyond, or if this has to be unanticipated work, a dollar amount and a beginning and an end date.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6892.104s">Was</a> there a time date to go to the dollar amount?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6896.468s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6896.668s">In</a> other words, was it a month, two months, three months? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6898.81s">I</a> mean, if you're hitting ledge, it's quite obvious you're going to stop your
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6949.015s">Uh,</a> I got no problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6950.115s">I</a> think we were asking for, as we did the last copy of the contract so we could see at them and the engineering contract, we asked for the solicitor to give us a copy of that so we could <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6958.649s">so</a> we could review that, have a better understanding of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6961.931s">I</a> guess my part that I just don't understand, because I'm not an expert anywhere in this particular area, but all I know is if you run into a snafu in any type of a contract, what overruns, whatever it might be, I believe that there was a beginning and an ending date and there's a penalty and a reward clause if you go over or beyond or if you don't exceed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6980.905s">And</a> I don't hear that conversation being said. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6982.906s">I</a> agree with Councilor Longo to take it out of free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6985.068s">So</a> I would support the amendment to take it out of free cash.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7128.426s">Mr.</a> President, if anyone knows anything about the, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7133.11s">the</a> Medford Hillside up there by Tufts University where Sacred Heart Church used to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7137.772s">Mark</a> Spector and their Medford Hillside hardware store was well known. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7142.115s">He</a> was a very good businessman, but he was also very kind and gentle to his neighbors in the community and to the church when the church was there and as well to Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7152.28s">So</a> he's certainly going to be missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7154.861s">It's</a> the second icon up there of a business person. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7159.664s">Last</a> year, it was the lady who owned Tasty Gourmet. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7162.903s">Um,</a> and now it's Mark Spector. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7164.864s">So</a> hopefully, um, they're at peace and their family is somewhat comforted at this particular time.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7497.141s">I</a> would be absolutely remiss if I did not say a few words about this gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7501.383s">First</a> of all, this is the gentleman who came down to a Medford Public Works building and made intentional lies about <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7510.947s">me,</a> Robert Penta, as a candidate for mayor in this past election. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7514.848s">He</a> basically went down there and said things that were absolutely not true.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7521.911s">You're</a> talking about, it most certainly is about your colleague. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7526.733s">He</a> didn't do anything good because if he did say anything good, he wouldn't mind his business and he wouldn't spew out lies about a candidate running for office.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7534.795s">I</a> am talking about somebody, talking about somebody who had no right saying what they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7539.957s">I</a> am not, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7543.418s">Your</a> city solicitor is well aware of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7548.5s">He</a> even wrote a commentary as he relates to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7551.362s">You</a> just can't go around talking about people and telling lies. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7554.183s">And</a> that's just what the gentleman did.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7650.582s">Mr.</a> President, we're talking about acknowledgements and, and, and acknowledging people for what they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7655.983s">This</a> gentleman is part of the same union who came to this city of Medford and harassed people and bullied people.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_ptMnNu2KUwo/2025-03-21_ptMnNu2KUwo.html">Medford City Council - Nov. 24, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=95.321s">One</a> of the unfortunate things about this past election, it's over 3000 people didn't have an opportunity to vote on this because they weren't either instructed or they failed to turn over their ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=104.963s">which</a> basically would have enlightened us as to what was the real true feeling of the folks here within this community, recognizing that it was a tax on top of the tax that they were already paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=115.77s">So</a> I would hope when, when, and if in fact this committee ever does take place, um, that a complete explanation as to this five year commitment that needs to take place by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=127.216s">Um,</a> and unfortunately the taxpayers will not have an opportunity to have a choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=132.159s">It'll</a> be the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=133.403s">that</a> will be appointed, they don't make that choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=135.704s">So</a> the vote that took place this past November gave no indication as to what, if any, this money was going to be used for. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=143.886s">And</a> more importantly, and most importantly, the guarantee from the state is only at 18 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=149.088s">It's</a> not at 100 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=150.188s">And</a> as a result of that, taxpayers for the next five years and this year happens to be the lowest of all the years that CPA, since it's been around since 2001, it's the lowest it's ever been. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=162.329s">And</a> if it continues to go in this mainstream, the taxpayers of this community are going to wind up paying for something that they never got their commitment back from the commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=170.896s">So</a> unfortunately, the misinformation that went out there, the guarantee of the money coming back from the state is absolutely not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=177.662s">The</a> fact that it's a five-year commitment and the fact that almost 3,000 people failed to vote on this because they either not instructed or they didn't turn that ballot over, I just don't think it's a real true indication. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=189.533s">of</a> where the city wants to go on having another tax on top of a tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=193.735s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=194.035s">Mr.</a> President, if I may.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=239.789s">One</a> of the things that the taxpayers need to be aware of is the fact that, yes, while it might have won by some 1,200 votes and 3,000 people didn't vote for it, the fact of the matter is they didn't have an opportunity to know what they were going to be voting for and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=253.54s">That's</a> the difference between now and 2001. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=256.482s">So</a> whenever this committee is set up, <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=259.032s">I</a> think they really need to have a full-fledged understanding of maybe having some public meetings to take place to get an idea, and the five categories that are out there that it's offering, what the money can and will be used for, not because of the decision of a nine-member committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=274.555s">That's</a> what I'm trying to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=275.935s">That's</a> the difference between then and now, and that's a big difference.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=811.43s">Mr.</a> President, I've got no problem supporting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=813.892s">I'd</a> like to put a B paper attached to that because is there any kind of a law that exists out there that <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=819.369s">holds</a> and abeyance any service person's mortgage payments until such time that they come back home? <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=826.335s">Because</a> sometimes if an individual goes overseas or is in the service and he has a family here and they just can't meet the financial obligations that are required of a mortgage payment, just like we're doing with the excise tax and the cars, is there any kind of law out there? <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=841.807s">Can</a> we get an answer back? <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=842.728s">Is</a> there some kind of law that holds and abeyance mortgage payments until such time as the service person comes back?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=854.951s">Mortgage</a> payments on their home.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=860.515s">That's</a> why I asked for clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=862.236s">It</a> may not be a function of the council, but it's a function if they have mortgage payments and then if the city wants to be generous enough, they can turn around and take their property tax assessment, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=872.664s">Right</a> now, we have so many servicemen, not only are coming home, <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=877.158s">that</a> have post-traumatic stress, that have physical infirmities, that they have so many disabilities that are confronting them, you know, and our government on a wholesale basis is just putting a lot of this stuff on hold while they're talking about bringing in, you know, illegal refugees and <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=891.034s">things</a> of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=891.975s">But</a> if we're going to take care of people within our own community, I think we should look at what can be beneficial to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=897.94s">And</a> if it means filing a piece of legislation, then so be it, whether it's a property tax reduction or hold that in abatement or even a mortgage, um, uh, holding a mortgage in abatement, whatever it might be, they deserve to have that benefit, uh, available to them.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1870.283s">Mr.</a> President, we already have a rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1872.424s">It's</a> rule number 20, disposition of all items appearing upon the council agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1877.006s">And</a> referring back to what Councilor Alongo-Curran has just alluded to, I agree with her 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1881.909s">Section</a> number four under rule 20 states that any financial paper appearing on the council agenda for the first time <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1887.323s">shall</a> be automatically laid on the table for one week when such action is requested by any councillor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1892.884s">Common</a> sense would tell you that we did this a couple of weeks ago because we got over $800,000 worth of a paper in front of the papers, three separate papers, to be voted upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1902.466s">And</a> as a result of that, since we had received nothing in our informational packet on a Friday afternoon, we had laid that on the table with the hopes that we would get more and further information the following Tuesday, which was this past Tuesday evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1914.486s">Here</a> it is again now the third Tuesday in a row. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1916.847s">And</a> again, asked for the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1918.949s">And</a> then we did not receive one scintilla, one document, anything that represents itself regarding those three papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1925.352s">So</a> the council rules are obviously in operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1929.235s">And</a> after the seven days, if you've called a rule seven, a rule number four, excuse me, on the section four under rule 20, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1935.638s">You'll</a> be able to have any one council say, listen, we haven't gotten the paperwork in front of us, you know, and we're not going to entertain this any further until such time it comes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1942.515s">You</a> already have the rules there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1944.796s">Sending</a> it to the Rules Committee is nothing more than another delay tactic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1947.818s">You</a> already have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1948.758s">It's</a> built into your rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1950.219s">And</a> common sense will tell you, if the rule tells you how you're supposed to be operating, and you fail to get the information that you're supposed to be getting, well, then you take the very next step. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1958.103s">You</a> just lay it on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1959.204s">You</a> leave it on the table until such information. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1961.745s">And</a> that's what we have right before us right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1963.406s">We</a> have three papers that I would assume will just stay on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1966.388s">We've</a> asked for their information to be forthcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1968.725s">We've</a> had the city audited, and then we had Louise Miller appear before us, and we still haven't gotten the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1974.228s">So</a> I think right now it's operating pretty good, and it's right in front of us right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1979.03s">And</a> I think council owes the obligation to the taxpayer, as Councilor Lungo-Koehn has alluded to, to not discuss that paper until we have an opportunity to receive the information to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1988.474s">We</a> don't have to wait for the next council to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1990.415s">It's</a> happening right in front of you right now with three particular papers that you've asked for the information, you've laid it on the table, <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1996.89s">You</a> haven't gotten the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1998.331s">It's</a> three weeks running, and I don't know why, but if this is the way this administration wants to work, then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=2003.793s">Hopefully,</a> the new administration doesn't do the same thing, but this is what you have in front of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=2007.675s">These</a> are our rules right now, and I think they're operating pretty good on these particular matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=2011.976s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=2013.097s">Thank</a> you, Constable Benton.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3937.659s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3939.02s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3940.8s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3941.58s">And</a> the paper that you have there, Jack, there's a question on the bottom of the line there that says, are there going to be any, I think restrictions as it relates to the parking and the second, they're going to make everything possible, but that's a city of Medford sign that's posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3956.496s">that</a> says no parking from seven in the morning to five at night, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3960.598s">So</a> I'm assuming that since they didn't come before the council to get the permit, I mean, where do they go? <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3965.901s">The</a> building department? <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3966.962s">I</a> don't know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3976.087s">So</a> if they were issued from the DPW, I thought all permits that applied for would have to come before the council, Mr. Clark. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3981.49s">Is</a> that true?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3987.29s">There's</a> stuff to come, you have to open up a street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3989.491s">They're</a> opening up a street for Digley, for Gasley, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3993.294s">They're</a> supposed to post a $10,000 bond as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4004.22s">We're</a> going to get that information tomorrow.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4235.74s">Mr.</a> President, this is not the first time we've had to bring this up, and this seems to be an ongoing situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4241.024s">As</a> you're coming up the exit to Roosevelt Circle going south down Route 93, it's a combination of the lights being off, and then once you go halfway around the circle, the lights are off. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4250.791s">I</a> know this was presented to Representative Donato before in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4254.974s">There</a> was some concern about the state coming in there and doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4259.037s">Apparently,</a> they still haven't found time to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4261.019s">It's</a> a direct public safety hazard, especially for people going around that rotary. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4265.767s">trying</a> to take the right either to south border road or down to forest street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4270.429s">It's</a> absolutely dark over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4272.19s">Um,</a> the light's coming off the ramp and then on the opposite side of route. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4275.811s">So</a> once again, I move that that be forwarded to the state department of public safety and have that forwarded to our representative, Mr. Donato, because we're supposed to have been taken care of and it's still not been addressed.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4292.352s">Roll</a> call vote, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4331.401s">As</a> you're coming off the exit from Route 93 south.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4353.347s">Say</a> it again, Eddie. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4356.43s">What</a> was your amendment? <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4358.772s">Oh,</a> to have representative Donato go back to the state department of public safety and put those lights back on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4364.478s">They</a> were, this, this is months, this is running for months now that they haven't redressed them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4369.532s">are</a> on the road, not all of them are out, but the ones that are really significantly out are the ones that take you halfway around the rotary, that take you to South border road and to Forestry.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4421.901s">Mr.</a> President, the amount of things that are happening today out there and with youngsters not having <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4428.839s">Especially</a> youngsters that might be coming from a single-family home. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4432.682s">It's</a> just unfortunate that some of the programs that are offered are not being offered. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4438.045s">It</a> should be something that should be looked into. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4440.066s">And</a> as a result of that, I think it would serve us well to look forward either in through the private sector, the non-profits, because we have a whole bunch of those that take place when we do our community block grant funding, or also in our public and private school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4456.944s">programs</a> that are out there that can serve a purpose that can mentor youngsters at an early age. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4465.046s">There's</a> a wild bill that's out there right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4467.206s">It's</a> a Senate bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4468.587s">It</a> passed the Senate. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4469.287s">It's</a> on its way to the House. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4470.467s">And</a> I'm quite sure this might be brought up next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4473.168s">But</a> it's sort of like it addresses, it calls itself age appropriate sexual content that's going to be mandated by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4483.505s">into</a> our public school system for children 11 and 12 years of age. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4486.827s">And</a> it's causing quite a controversy and quite a stir as it relates to what is going to be considered to be age appropriate and what is age appropriate for the certain part of sexual connotations and sexual education and anything that revolves itself around a child's either awareness or lack of awareness as to where he or she might be going or understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4509.947s">And</a> these are the things I think that need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4511.709s">You</a> know, it's unfortunate when you have stuff like that, that they're trying to teach or educate you on, but they won't give you a civics class and make a mandated class to learn about your government, local, federal, and state. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4523.318s">You</a> know, it's kind of crazy in this day and age, especially, you know, you're trying to get people involved, and good government are having positions on government on issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4531.572s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I don't know what mentoring program the city of Medford has or even offers, but I'd like to get a report back from either the superintendent of schools and any private school organization here in the city of Medford that might offer a mentoring program for youngsters, could be troubled youngsters, youngsters from single parent homes, or just youngsters in general that have become available here to the city.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4611.187s">Well,</a> that's just it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4612.167s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4613.107s">Are</a> they after school programs? <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4615.288s">Are</a> they scholastic type of programs? <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4617.459s">Are</a> they athletic programs? <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4618.96s">Are</a> they community awareness programs? <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4621.141s">It's</a> a mentoring program that a kid gets after he's out of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4625.463s">Or</a> he might get it while he's in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4627.884s">Specialized</a> classes that relate to students that might have disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4631.866s">Are</a> they having special mentoring programs that can make the child adapt to life-like situations? <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4636.268s">Good</a> evening, citizen.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4850.345s">Mr.</a> President, most recently, the street sweeping program has taken off in a very inconsistent manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4856.789s">Some</a> folks, when they're having their streets swept, have had their cars ticketed and towed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4861.591s">Other</a> streets, cars have not been ticketed and towed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4865.082s">And</a> again, um, the, uh, allowing, uh, the notification, the notification, uh, the inconsistent notification of what streets, how and when, uh, to be taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4875.369s">Not</a> everybody, number one has a computer and not everybody drives to the city of Medford to see the big sign that says a sweet stripping is going to begin on a, you know, there has to be a better program that it has to be identified and a, <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4887.54s">in</a> a definitive way where people, like in other cities and towns, know on what particular week and what particular month and what particular side of the street it's going to get swept. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4897.246s">And</a> the tagging and the towing has got to be consistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4899.528s">It</a> just cannot be arbitrary and capricious at any point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4902.89s">So</a> with that being said, I know the council has asked for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4905.611s">It</a> goes back to 2014, and we still haven't gotten a program presented to us as to why and how the best method is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4912.515s">You</a> just can't keep going around banging on trees <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4915.432s">You</a> know, put your sawhorses up here, there, and everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4918.314s">That</a> just doesn't cut it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4920.335s">You</a> need a comprehensive program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4922.416s">Same</a> thing with the leaf pickup program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4924.077s">You</a> need to have something that's comprehensive, it's established, people know what it is, whether they get it in their water bill, whether they get it in their tax bill, whether they get it online. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4935.563s">Something</a> that basically says this is the way it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4938.345s">And</a> this goes a long way with having signage that directs itself toward these particular issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4944.165s">City</a> of Medford needs to get itself into a direct signage program that addresses a whole host of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4949.966s">And</a> again, what better way to have a signage program become operative? <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4953.467s">It</a> would be a great course to be taught up at the Medford Vocational School, where they could take during maybe the spring or the fall months of the year when the weather is good. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4963.89s">Every</a> single street in the city can be identified, the type of street that it is, whether it's a public street, whether it's a private street, the signage that's on there, take a picture of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4973.347s">You</a> know, I made this offering about five years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4975.788s">It</a> was sent up to the vocational school, and the teacher at that time thought it was a great idea, but it never went any further. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4980.77s">Why,</a> I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4982.81s">You</a> know, like so many things, you never find out why. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4986.191s">They</a> don't want to do things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4987.792s">But</a> this is definitely a homegrown type of program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4991.713s">It</a> can work well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4993.174s">It</a> definitely would serve a purpose here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4995.735s">But</a> when you have programs that are inconsistent, and you can't get an answer as to why I got a ticket and somebody else didn't get a ticket, <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5002.628s">It's</a> sort of like unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5004.049s">Same</a> thing with the parking kiosk program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5006.051s">It's</a> an unfair system. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5007.092s">It</a> doesn't work properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5008.373s">Same</a> thing with these parking program here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5011.055s">So</a> I'd like to make a request, Mr. President, that you would probably maybe have a committee of the whole meeting set up with, you know, the council, but ahead of time, have the council have their thoughts come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5024.703s">And</a> maybe open it up to the taxpayers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5027.265s">Maybe</a> just have a, maybe a public hearing so it can be operative for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5030.948s">A</a> public hearing as it relates to setting up a designated suite streeping program here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5037.032s">So</a> we don't have to go through this each and every year and you don't have to listen to the complaints and consistency and transparency will tell the whole story. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5044.94s">So</a> that would be my recommendation, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5295.945s">So</a> on this paper, as amended by Councilor Naik, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5300.168s">Mr.</a> President, you know, doing something biannually doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5303.75s">It's</a> only twice a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5305.531s">You</a> know, if you can have a program, you want it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5308.333s">There</a> were some streets that had four sweet streepers on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5311.875s">Some</a> streets, you're lucky if you saw one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5313.496s">I</a> mean, the logic, it's an inconsistent program that doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5319.1s">Now,</a> Rick just got through saying, Councilor Caraviello got through saying, <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5322.004s">that</a> one of the employees in the Department of Public Works said there was no police officer available. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5325.925s">What</a> about the day that the police officer was available that was giving out tagging and towing? <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5330.226s">It's</a> so inconsistent and anyone who's gotten a ticket should appeal that ticket to the city because it's inconsistent as to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5337.488s">You</a> just can't run programs like this, like Councilor Briano just alluded to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5343.349s">How</a> do you have transparency? <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5344.629s">You</a> have a new guy coming on or a woman who's going to be a new DPW director. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5348.872s">You</a> know, there's got to be a direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5350.493s">And</a> this should be a high priority for direction that should be given to this new person coming on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5355.074s">You</a> can't run programs that are inconsistent and incompatible to what's supposed to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5360.216s">But</a> you need the signage that goes along with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5362.437s">So</a> you can't be Houdini trying to figure out what's going on if the streets aren't properly signed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5366.739s">That's</a> why it's a combination of signage and consistency to the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5370.841s">You</a> can't do it in reverse. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5372.041s">You</a> can't have the program then decide to put the signage up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5374.642s">So</a> that's why I would say, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5378.078s">committee</a> of the whole meeting with DPW, you know, and the public to get some of their ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5383.32s">This</a> is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5384.161s">You</a> know, you're, you're, you're going into a new adventure, bring them in, let them know that this is their city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5389.263s">This</a> isn't a closed shop of ideas.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5999.037s">Mr.</a> President, one of the things that present this as an enticing matter is the technology and communication is ever-changing, whether it be on public access, whether it be the private enterprise system. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6015.162s">But</a> another thing that should be looked upon with this radio station is by making it something locally accessible, you want to encourage handicapped folks to have the same opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6025.984s">And</a> one of the things that the speaker just mentioned, being at Cheviro Auditorium, whether it's there, the public library, someplace that's easily accessible on a bus route for whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6035.707s">The</a> proposed location for the high school of the present time is not easily accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6039.868s">It's</a> not handicap accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6041.995s">It</a> has too many detriments running against it, especially late at night, evenings, winter time, inclement weather and what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6048.681s">But</a> this idea of having a station where people can come and be heard and hopefully be the catalyst that eventually gets ourselves with a public access station, I think it's a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6059.75s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6060.951s">Number</a> two, with the mayor sitting on over 300, I believe it's about $370,000 at the present time in public access money and not having public access in the city, <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6070.38s">since</a> December of 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6072.001s">I</a> believe this is the mayor's intentional failure to move forward on something that he is contractually bound to do according to the contract that he has not only with Comcast, but also with Verizon, who came on a couple of years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6086.565s">So</a> what we're looking at is the idea of getting small equipment at a not a very large price. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6093.787s">We're</a> not looking at 4,000 to 5,000 square feet of space. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6097.348s">We're</a> not looking at buying vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6098.989s">We're</a> looking at something <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6100.363s">that</a> can present not only an interest in this community, but it can present itself with accessibility because that's what's mandated in the contract that Comcast just signed with the mayor for another 10 years, unfortunately, another 10 years with the same vendor without having an opportunity to have this thing monitored even after the third or the fourth, fifth year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6119.15s">So</a> with that being said, I think what we should do is to <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6123.853s">I</a> think we need to do is to get the exact dollar amount as to what we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6127.794s">This</a> is coming into the fourth quarter of this year, and I don't think those monies will be readily available until January of next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6134.876s">So</a> what our monies are as of September 30th of this year, that brings us to the third quarter for Verizon and Comcast, and the idea of having, and they don't have a public access or a cable access committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6149.559s">And</a> without having a public access committee, <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6152.466s">And</a> only leaving this in the hands of the mayor, it's quite obvious that not only whether you were a candidate, not a candidate, or whether you were a person in the community who wanted to see your elected officials or a new candidate running for office, you lost that opportunity because we have no public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6167.452s">But</a> you're being charged each and every month through your Verizon and your Comcast bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6172.114s">So</a> if this radio station is the beginning effort, if it's a catalyst to get ourselves going, I think it's a great move to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6181.009s">And</a> with that being said, I would urge my colleagues to urge the president administration to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6187.954s">And</a> he's not going to respond back why he's not having public access, but it's another area to say, let's do this in the interest of not only public access, but it's also a public communication as it relates to what's going on here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6201.685s">Every</a> single person behind this rail, every single person on the other side of the rail. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6205.525s">We'll</a> have that opportunity to be on the radio, to be interviewed, or to possibly have a show that talks about our city of Medford, whether you like or dislike, and where we need to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6216.73s">I</a> just don't understand why this administration was in such fear of having public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6222.433s">And</a> I don't know what he could have possibly thought that public access was going to do to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6227.375s">He's</a> not serving in office anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6229.316s">He's</a> retiring. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6230.476s">So</a> his office wasn't even that issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6234.158s">Every</a> single council that's here that ran, that ran for reelection, every new council that was running, the school committee, they were denied a privilege. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6241.382s">They</a> were denied their opportunity to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6243.603s">And</a> that's what public access is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6245.924s">So</a> here is another opportunity through the mechanisms of public access to have a public radio offering. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6251.847s">And</a> I just think it's a great way to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6254.088s">And</a> Mr. Mayor, excuse me, Mr. President, I'm going to ask that you, and I don't know if you're going to be the incoming president, <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6261.938s">Well,</a> who the new president's going to be next year for the city council? <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6266.0s">Well,</a> you might be the mayor, you never know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6267.7s">But</a> the fact of the matter is this, that whoever the president's gonna be should take the leadership role to move on this particular issue in the interest not only of public information, but just in the interest of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6280.146s">Was</a> it you, Councilor Camuso? <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6281.186s">They</a> just said they were, Marlin is having this televised for their football game coming up as they, was it? <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6287.789s">Oh,</a> was it Joe? <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6288.489s">You</a> said it, I'm sorry, you said it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6291.999s">Yeah,</a> it's a big game, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6292.84s">Well,</a> we don't have nobody to do our big game, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6295.402s">And</a> we haven't had anybody to do our big game for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6297.964s">And</a> the sad part about it is each and every month you just keep paying out in your Verizon and your Comcast bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6304.65s">It's</a> not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6305.871s">And</a> the taxpayers of this community, the rate payers for cable television deserve better. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6310.456s">They</a> deserve to have their money used and used properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6314.419s">So</a> that's being said.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6319.334s">No,</a> to send it to you, whoever the president's going to be next year, to enforce, to request of the mayor to go forward with a committee, which would be a cable committee that would serve in the best interest of this community, that not only addresses peg access by way of public television, but also public access and a radio system.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6402.814s">No,</a> no, no, no, I said we've heard from the President, whether it be Councilor Dello Russo or whoever, if you want to take action before the end of the year, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6410.278s">But</a> I think it definitely needs to have a public access committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6413.62s">And</a> I think at your behest or whoever the President's behest is, they encourage the Mayor to go forward and put that committee together so we can go forward with public access.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6997.042s">And</a> as a result of, I, unfortunately, I don't believe she came to the meeting on that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7001.337s">but</a> the Republic people said at that point in time that they were going to have a meeting down there at the end of January. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7007.22s">Then</a> they bumped it up to March and then they changed it to a, to a later date. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7011.942s">And</a> I think it was in May. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7013.723s">So</a> with that being said, um, that was the purpose of, uh, the meeting of the senior center, uh, how and where would the seniors be able to park and what was the, uh, what was the process going to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7026.729s">So</a> they brought the kiosk down there.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7066.634s">We'll</a> be discussing that later on.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7092.443s">What's</a> that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7097.125s">Mr.</a> Clark, what is that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7121.602s">Refer</a> this one, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7123.162s">Um,</a> can we just leave that upstanding right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7126.103s">Because</a> it's the other one.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7134.644s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7135.124s">Just,</a> just merge them together because I was going to say merge these two together.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7240.869s">Who's</a> the next two on the table?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7426.341s">Mr.</a> President, earlier this evening, the Committee on Transportation met as it related to papers in committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7432.924s">And</a> some of the things we discussed were the concerns as it relates to the Craddock Bridge, bus stops in Medford Square and in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7441.015s">and</a> other ancillary matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7443.897s">What</a> was disturbing that came out of that meeting was when one of the, um, one of the, uh, business owners came in and indicated to us that, um, per his conversation with representative Donato, who had a conversation with somebody from the mass department of transportation, they have been meeting here with the city of Medford on a biweekly basis with a gentleman from the department of public works. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7467.391s">And</a> that is very disturbing to hear that because right now nobody, <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7470.947s">assert</a> anything, we have asked on numerous occasions for some kind of transparency as it relates to what is going on, as it relates to not only the Karatek Bridge, the time schedule, the lighting, the closing down of the business, just having some basis of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7488.681s">We</a> were also told and notified, and Councilor Caraviello, he can correct me on this, that the Chamber of Commerce hasn't even been a party to any kind of response or any kind of notification from the State Department of Transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7499.923s">That</a> leaves a big void right now into trying to understand what is going on between the state department of transportation and their interaction here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7508.826s">If</a> in fact the city of Medford is meeting with the state department of transportation and they are not notifying this council and the office of community development is not being notified and the business merchants aren't being notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7520.169s">Chamber</a> of commerce is not being notified and the council has asked on numerous occasions for an update as to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7526.436s">there</a> was a serious problem as it relates to that whole Craddock bridge operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7531.098s">Another</a> part of the committee report was asking, you know, it's supposed to be six days a week, double shifts, and everybody knows they're not down there six days a week, double shifts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7540.401s">So</a> maybe that's the reason why it's taking two and a half years to maybe complete this, but further asking a question on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7547.244s">Also,</a> I believe the bus stop as it relates to in West and South Medford, that's in front of Oasis, <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7553.605s">the</a> request to have it be moved across the street to where the dry cleaners is over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7558.409s">That</a> seemed to be an understandable issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7561.391s">I</a> believe that there will be a meeting set up in the South Medford area over there quickly as it relates to the bus stop, not only the bus stop moving, but a place for the business merchants when they have deliveries that take place over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7575.962s">And</a> I believe also the request and the concern was to go forward <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7580.726s">regarding</a> the bus stops in Medford Square that would be coming down on Main Street and having them either detoured to Riverside Ave or River Street or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7590.071s">But</a> we got a notification, Mr. Clerk, you can correct me if I'm wrong, that the gentleman who now is in charge of bus stops with the T made an indication that he doesn't come out to nighttime meetings, is that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7600.576s">And</a> because he doesn't come out to nighttime meetings, this doesn't make any sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7604.693s">So</a> we're going to have to figure out another way how to move them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7607.014s">And</a> maybe our representative, Mr. Donato can make this guy understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7610.676s">You</a> know, everyone works during the course of the day and you know, and that's part of their job to come to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7616.459s">This</a> is a huge project. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7618.08s">It's</a> a new huge undertaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7619.861s">Bus</a> stops are a huge issue as it relates to this, this whole undertaking as a result of their lack of transparency and coming forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7627.544s">I</a> believe it was a vote of the committee for which council Lungo current, <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7631.408s">and</a> Michael Knox, and unfortunately he had to leave because of a family issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7636.85s">We</a> made a request that a temporary cease and desist on the whole project of the Craddock Bridge become operative. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7645.274s">It's</a> obvious that they're being absolutely non-responsive, non-responsive to the council, not responsive to anyone here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7652.036s">But</a> the sad part about it is if they really are meeting with somebody from the Department of Public Works, <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7658.503s">And</a> we're not being notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7659.704s">And</a> we have asked over and over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7662.266s">This</a> shows you the complete breakdown that is taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7665.549s">And</a> the only way maybe to get their attention is to move, Mr. President, and ask for a temporary cease and desist to bring them to the table so we can have this discussion as to why we, the taxpayers, we, the council, we, the chamber, and we, the administration, aren't being brought up to date and being told it's up to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7683.444s">You</a> know, it's just an unfortunate matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7686.274s">Businesses</a> are being affected. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7687.355s">One</a> business merchant came in there and indicated how he had it closed down. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7690.677s">Lost</a> over $3,000 worth of business on a particular night, the night that they put the bridge up, with no notification and what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7697.942s">So-</a> Go ahead.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7750.159s">So</a> hopefully- Well, the gentleman that's now replaced the lady that was in charge of bus stops, I'll give you his number. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7755.081s">I'll</a> give everybody his number if you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7756.261s">Oh,</a> I've spoken to him.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7761.364s">But</a> it won't make any difference who the legislative liaison is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7763.685s">The</a> fact of the matter is this is all after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7766.326s">And</a> I know you have a meeting scheduled, I think, for next Tuesday? <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7769.267s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7770.028s">Which</a> is next Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7771.903s">And</a> I think if they get the temperament that the council is not happy, and this seems to be a forced situation, these resolutions go back to June of this past year, September of this year, for which I've asked on numerous occasions, and other members of the council have expressed their disdain as to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7788.25s">There's</a> absolutely, it seems to be a forced situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7791.372s">And</a> the only way to keep their feet to the fire is to let them know that not only are we upset, but we don't approve of what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7797.415s">And</a> all this is is basically having a temporary restraining order against you, <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7800.992s">to</a> not do any more business until such time that you get this issue resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7804.735s">Who</a> is the clerk of the works? <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7805.916s">Who</a> is the city's clerk of the works on this particular project? <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7810.399s">We</a> don't have any of these people. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7811.7s">And</a> if we do, they must be mysterious people, because nobody knows who they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7816.704s">This</a> council should be apprised through every part of that particular project. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7820.547s">This</a> has been going on since 2003, when Councilor Lungo-Koehn brought this resolution up for the very first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7826.727s">This</a> is now 2015, 12 years later. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7830.188s">So</a> the bridge did not sink in 12 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7832.729s">It's</a> been there for over 100 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7834.449s">It's</a> quite obvious that it'll make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7836.43s">The</a> fact of the matter is, Mr. President, sometimes you've got to push and be hard to make sure you get your questions resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7841.912s">So</a> that's the result. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7843.312s">That</a> was the report coming out of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7845.653s">So</a> I'll move the question to the floor.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7848.414s">Madam</a> Vice President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8181.712s">I</a> don't think—I hear what you're saying, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8183.813s">It's</a> not sending out the wrong message. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8185.153s">It's</a> sending out a message that we're really upset that they have no way to operate like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8189.795s">But</a> two points. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8190.775s">The</a> first one is this, that even if this were to happen, that back in the days—that's not true because they were supposed to be doing two shifts right from the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8199.938s">They're</a> lucky if they work three days a week, if they're working three to four right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8203.258s">and</a> they're not doing double shifts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8204.759s">So</a> I'm not really worried about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8206.02s">I'm</a> just more concerned over the fact that if, in fact, these meetings have taken place, then the responsible person in behalf of the city has failed to notify the appropriate authority, whether it be at the mayor's office, the council, OCD office, or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8220.492s">And</a> the last part, Mr. Clerk, I forgot to mention, is to get the minutes of those meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8224.575s">I</a> believe it's on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8225.636s">The</a> minutes of the meetings that <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8227.494s">DOT</a> has had whoever the city person is that has been to the meetings on this biweekly basis, you know, if, um, if a representative Donato has been told by DOT that the meeting has been taking place, uh, according to him, as he explained to one of the business vendors in the community, then, you know, something's going on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8245.069s">Nobody</a> knows nothing about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8246.11s">It</a> doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8246.991s">It's</a> unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8248.252s">So</a> with that being said, I'll hold off on a week until we, after the meeting of next Tuesday, and then, uh, let's just see where we're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8254.778s">But</a> you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8255.689s">Hopefully,</a> they'll be really forthcoming with some of these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8258.15s">They're</a> willing to budge and work with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8259.991s">Beyond</a> that, you just hope the MBTA comes here, too, because you can't piecemeal this thing together. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8265.174s">It's</a> not making any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8269.276s">Well,</a> it's not that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8270.516s">That's</a> why we have our representatives and senators. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8272.597s">This</a> is where their clout comes in, OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8274.819s">If</a> they're really worth their salt as an elected official up in the statehouse, they'll get those people here from the MBTA, because they're not going to want to hear us.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8350.391s">Well,</a> the whole idea, Mr. President, is every single committee that's made a report has been voted upon and accepted by this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8355.573s">Now,</a> all of a sudden, what are we going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8357.173s">Go</a> to a committee of the whole meeting and discuss what took place there? <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8359.874s">If</a> the council wanted to be there, he walked right by, couldn't come into the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8362.774s">The</a> rules are the rules, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8364.155s">There</a> may be rules, but you know something, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8366.955s">Let's</a> be a little bit logical here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8368.276s">Read</a> the rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8368.856s">No</a> report of a committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8370.088s">shall</a> be received unless agreed to and a committee actually assembled. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8373.633s">The</a> committee was actually assembled. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8375.216s">It</a> was the transportation committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8377.203s">It</a> wasn't a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8378.464s">Read</a> rule 35, OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8380.264s">That's</a> what took place.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8417.13s">Because</a> I need to study it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8418.672s">I</a> challenge the chair, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8421.138s">It's</a> quite obvious. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8421.859s">And</a> that means that every single committee that meets and comes to this council floor and submits a report and submits a report and the council votes on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8430.544s">That's</a> those have all been illegal. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8432.305s">Is</a> that what we're saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8433.226s">They've</a> all been not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8435.007s">That</a> means every single committee that's gone and had a committee report and came back to this council, read the committee report and the council voted on it was done wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8443.072s">Why</a> are we doing this? <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8443.873s">And</a> what do you even have a committee for?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8461.889s">Good.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8462.509s">Be</a> an obstructionist all you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8464.15s">Move</a> the paper, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8464.991s">There's</a> nothing wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8465.852s">Either</a> that or change all the rules around here, because these committees mean absolutely nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8469.435s">I've</a> read that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8469.815s">You've</a> opposed it in every step. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8470.836s">These</a> mean absolutely nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8472.818s">Move</a> the paper, Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_2dtPwwQz2O0/2025-03-21_2dtPwwQz2O0.html">Medford, MA City Council - Nov. 17, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=244.29s">Whoa,</a> whoa, whoa. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=245.831s">What</a> papers?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=256.496s">On</a> that motion, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=257.816s">Last</a> week, the motion was laid on the table because we did not receive anything as it related to what we were spending $300,000 on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=264.418s">I</a> believe the council's request was to have a paper in our hands as we view it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=268.639s">We</a> did not receive anything this past week till today. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=270.739s">So</a> I'm going to move that that paper lay on the table until we get a written explanation of what the $300,000 is needed for, for the department of public works.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=285.696s">I'm</a> going to take them one at a time and move to separate papers, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=305.472s">I</a> move the motion that the paper lay on the table until we get what the council asked for last week.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=324.345s">Mr.</a> President, to be perfectly clear, it's kind of clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=328.308s">The</a> council voted last week to lay it on the table pursuant to council rules until we get an explanation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=332.91s">We</a> have not received anything in writing as we asked for.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=375.663s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=376.684s">I</a> mean, how do you explain to anyone who's watching or sitting out here when you ask for information, you lay it on the table for specific purpose and you still haven't got your purpose resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=386.867s">How</a> can you even entertain it going further?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=399.117s">I</a> believe, Mr. President, to be quite candid, if you go back and review the tape, the council is quite clear, and nobody objected to getting the information to be forthcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=406.323s">And</a> besides, that's not the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=407.885s">It's</a> a $300,000 item. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=410.427s">It's</a> a $300,000 item that you're asking this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=413.269s">It's</a> quite obvious if this council is going to continue to go on, starting in January, nothing's going to change around here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=418.074s">You</a> people are going to have no information. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=419.775s">You're</a> just going to take someone who comes to the podium and makes a presentation without any discussion.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=494.688s">Miller.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=494.828s">Well,</a> further information then. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=496.549s">What's</a> the difference between Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=497.71s">Miller</a> and our city auditor? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=500.451s">I</a> mean.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=502.392s">No,</a> no, it isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=503.552s">Please,</a> don't try to twist the words. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=505.173s">We</a> have two separate people making a presentation on the same paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=509.175s">And</a> again, with all due respect to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=512.256s">Miller,</a> you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=515.75s">Where's</a> the information that the council asked for? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=517.911s">You</a> have three members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=519.531s">I</a> can't answer for anyone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=520.932s">Three</a> members have spoken up waiting for information. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=524.333s">So</a> I just think this is the tempo is being set for what's going to happen here in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=530.474s">Nothing</a> is going to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=531.815s">Nothing.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=572.043s">Were</a> you forwarded the request that information be forwarded to this council ahead of time?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=732.303s">This</a> concerns on that yard right now that there's leaks in the roof and the air conditioning and the heating system is not consistently working correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=738.986s">Where</a> is the city's position on that and the contractor?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=770.409s">This</a> building isn't even a year old. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=772.77s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=773.47s">And</a> it already has leaks in the roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=775.291s">It's</a> wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=777.152s">More</a> importantly, most importantly, if there's problems that still exist, why would you want to be paying this company off until their problems are fixed?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=793.785s">How</a> much are you holding back?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=803.412s">So</a> what do you need the money for now, then? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=804.693s">Why</a> don't you wait until they do what they're supposed to do?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=812.757s">A</a> good business approach would be to make sure that the job is done correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=816.738s">Why</a> would you want to pay them before the job is finished?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=830.663s">But</a> how can you say within 14 days if you still have the leak and you have air conditioning and heating system problems?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=845.191s">Well,</a> I'm going to concur with my colleague, Councilor Langel-Curran. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=847.752s">I</a> would not bond another thing in this city and put the city into any further debt when you're sitting on $6.5 million in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=854.694s">You</a> spent almost, not you, the city has spent almost $14.5 million to build that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=860.716s">It</a> isn't even a year old and it's already leaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=863.417s">It</a> doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=864.317s">You</a> try to tell us that to the common person on the street <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=866.751s">and</a> they're going to tell you there's something wrong with how the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=868.672s">Look</a> at that ceiling over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=869.773s">It's</a> going over two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=871.414s">Two</a> years you got holes in the ceiling. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=874.016s">And</a> you came in here and I believe you indicated it's going to cost the city in excess of a million dollars to do the roof and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=880.12s">Where's</a> that money going to come from? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=882.101s">Hope</a> you're not going to bond for that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=883.702s">You</a> know, the problem around here is that this administration has gotten away with it for way too long with not bringing the council in on issues such as this that have an extreme effect upon this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=896.245s">An</a> extreme effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=898.886s">More</a> importantly, it's the lack of communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=901.447s">You</a> just sat there and rattled off numbers that I couldn't keep up with. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=904.309s">You</a> had the numbers there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=905.289s">We</a> didn't even get a piece of paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=906.53s">I'm</a> going to move to the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=907.39s">Lay</a> on the table, Mr. President, until further notice, until we get further information.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1597.181s">Some</a> interesting points here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1598.582s">Number</a> one, the contract to build a building, was that an estimate by the contractor?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1609.446s">Listen,</a> the building cost over $14 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1612.287s">The</a> cost to remove that soil was in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1613.928s">It</a> wasn't an estimate. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1614.948s">It</a> was a cost that Brown and Caldwell gave to the city of Medford and signed a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1619.31s">Now,</a> this is really interesting for you guys and girls that are coming in next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1623.072s">Brown</a> and Caldwell also happens to be the same people that are going to do the spot in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1627.068s">and</a> the city's own parking lot over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1628.868s">So</a> if this is an example of their estimation of what needs to be done, the city really needs to take a hard look as to whether they're figures and whether they're really as good as they're supposed to be as good. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1640.651s">Now,</a> if there's a time sequence and there is a damage clause in there that basically says that they're going to do this for the city at a particular cost, is there anything in the contract that says if they find something that was unanticipated or unexpected, then there would be a cost overrun to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1657.061s">Those</a> are the words you need to look at to see if they're in the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1659.743s">And</a> if it's not in there, and if they're just giving you a document that says this is the cost overrun, well, the city shouldn't have to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1666.149s">It's</a> like you go to the store. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1667.03s">You</a> see something on sale. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1668.051s">Whatever</a> the sale is, that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1669.532s">If</a> they mismarked it, shame on the store. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1671.874s">They</a> mismarked it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1672.615s">I</a> mean, this is crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1674.877s">Think</a> about this, Louise. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1675.918s">This</a> is, you know, this does not make any sense.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1691.586s">Did</a> they do a sample survey?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1693.887s">And</a> if they did the sample survey, they must have dug down into the ground to see how deep and how far they had to go to get that dirt out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1701.149s">OK?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1701.729s">So</a> why should the city of Medford now have to be paying for that for which they couldn't anticipate on? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1707.261s">Think</a> about it, OK?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1710.023s">And</a> that's totally unfair to the taxpayers of this community who have to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1713.625s">I'm</a> going to stick to my original thing, that the paper lay on the table until these questions, these legal questions, get answered.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1719.829s">Yes,</a> it is.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1933.126s">Doesn't</a> a company such as this have to put up a bond? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1936.065s">Don't</a> they have to put up a bond? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1938.047s">The</a> people that are doing business with the city?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1957.565s">Was</a> the engineering company a subcontractor to the contractor?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1971.87s">So</a> who are we paying the $350,000 to?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1988.617s">But</a> you also indicated that Chapter 90 funds were underfunded.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1995.363s">Who</a> misestimated them? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1996.464s">We</a> did? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1997.225s">We</a> did.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1998.245s">We</a> did?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1999.447s">And</a> who was supposed to take that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2001.569s">Who</a> misestimated?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2004.571s">But</a> who? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2004.852s">We</a> misestimated. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2005.492s">What</a> department? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2009.303s">I'd</a> like to know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2014.326s">Somebody</a> had to submit the number. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2016.387s">Who</a> submitted the number, Louise?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2023.351s">No,</a> no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2023.611s">Louise,</a> it's not your job. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2024.191s">It</a> had to be a department that was responsible for this.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2032.055s">What's</a> purchasing? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2035.717s">City</a> engineer's office? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2037.531s">Somebody</a> had to put these numbers together, Chapter 90.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2042.472s">So</a> who is this conclave of people? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2044.893s">I</a> mean, listen, understand something here, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2048.954s">You're</a> being too honest by not being honest enough, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2052.135s">You</a> have a job and I have a job to do here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2053.775s">My</a> job right now until the end of this year is to make sure how these monies are spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2057.876s">And</a> if somebody mis-estimated in their job, misappropriated or whatever it might, misfunded, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2063.428s">This</a> council needs to know what's going on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2065.649s">That's</a> the problem around here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2066.789s">Nobody</a> wants, everybody hides everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2068.589s">Everything</a> is hush-hush. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2070.01s">If</a> it was misappropriated or mis-underfunded, what department did it? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2073.971s">Maybe</a> they need help in estimating, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2077.532s">Maybe</a> we need someone to go out to these departments when jobs like this take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2082.153s">Now,</a> we all know this was a complex job because I saw it every day when you went to, and I saw a lot of the ledge and everything that was going on over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2088.974s">But</a> the Chapter 90 funds, that comes from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2091.876s">They</a> give you a dollar amount, and that's it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2117.765s">How</a> much money came from Chapter 90 in this?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2128.269s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2128.869s">And</a> that's the city of Medford sending in that estimate, correct?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2140.573s">And</a> so somebody from the city had to send that in.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2148.678s">I</a> would just hope next year things are really done different around here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2154.283s">This</a> is really unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2156.805s">You</a> do a project, and what's underestimated, and what's underestimated, what's overestimated, what's coming in, what's going in? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2163.27s">And</a> then we're sitting on $6.5 million in free cash, $7 million in an enterprise fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2168.995s">We</a> haven't seen anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2170.796s">Why</a> isn't the money even coming out of the enterprise fund for this? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2173.418s">It's</a> a water and soil project. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2175.06s">Why</a> are we even bonding for this? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2178.296s">Again,</a> it's the administration's decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2180.797s">Again,</a> I would hope the Council takes a hard look at this and just saying, hey, you know, the water rates are almost off by $2 million this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2188.199s">And</a> I hope that's corrected in some shape, manner, or form, and that the taxpayer doesn't have to pay for it because you're sitting on $7.5 million of a surplus account. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2195.12s">Here's</a> another $350,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2196.601s">And</a> God knows, if the engineers has any brains, we'll probably file bankruptcy, and you'll never see a dime from this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2203.903s">This</a> is just a shame, Mr. President, because <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2206.106s">This</a> is what you get for having a lack of communication, a complete lack of communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2211.329s">We're</a> finding out at the end of the tunnel, not in the beginning or during the middle of it while it's being worked upon, at the end of the fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2217.252s">Now,</a> when did you get this bill for $350,000?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2228.978s">Like</a> when? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2230.039s">July,</a> August? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2230.419s">Last</a> summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2231.379s">Last</a> summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2232.62s">Here</a> we are, November 17.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2436.852s">Point</a> of further information.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2441.754s">Louise,</a> she said something very, very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2444.396s">Did</a> you hear what she said? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2446.837s">She</a> said she got a phone call. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2448.478s">Let</a> me ask everyone around this room. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2449.838s">Did</a> you all get phone calls? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2452.24s">You</a> know, this is how this building has been operating. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2454.361s">It</a> picks and chooses whatever it wants, when it wants. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2457.242s">It</a> is so terribly wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2459.323s">And</a> I would just hope the new administration doesn't do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2462.084s">Pick</a> you off one at a time, get your full votes and see you later. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2464.706s">And</a> goodbye. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2465.84s">That's</a> the most despicable way to run a government.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3357.796s">I</a> don't know if the intent of the resolution is to ban any type of a handgun or a replica of a handgun.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3469.473s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3470.254s">Please.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3470.694s">The</a> difference between having a replica gun and the appearance of a replica gun are like night and day. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3477.676s">The</a> state of New York made it very imperative <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3480.638s">The</a> colors are black, silver, I think dark blue, and there was four dark colors that they, aluminum, they would prohibit toy manufacturers from making guns like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3489.544s">But</a> you could still have a gun that looks like a gun, but it could be in a different color. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3494.447s">And</a> they believe there's a $300,000 fine that's attached to a gun manufacturer who makes a gun with those colors on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3504.113s">I</a> think what you really need to take a look at is you're not banning it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3507.615s">What</a> you're doing is you're controlling whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3510.456s">Now,</a> Councilor Knight just alluded to the fact that a black gun, I believe a black gun, the way the standard was, had to be painted orange by the nozzle, by the barrel. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3519.121s">And</a> what some of these kids are doing is they're painting it black to match the gun. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3521.942s">Now,</a> that puts a policeman in a very, you know, compromising position. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3525.884s">He</a> doesn't know if that gun is going to be real, fake, or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3529.326s">And</a> I think that's one of the concerns that have been brought about. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3532.048s">But</a> I think New York sort of like went about it the right way, because what they did in New York, as I said, they took a color and they made it iridescent, flashy, whatever it has to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3540.358s">If</a> a toy manufacturer wants to make a gun, the four colors that they took off the shelf that they could not put on, could not put on a gun, they could not sell it that way, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3549.763s">Now,</a> if a kid gets the gun and he decides to modify it, once again, you're talking another incident because what's he doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3558.888s">It's</a> either one of two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3561.269s">It's</a> going to have a strict appearance in the sale of the gun or the toy gun, or are you going to just eliminate them all together? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3569.822s">You</a> know, the question is, do you take the chance or you don't take the chance? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3572.825s">And</a> maybe the middle of the road is to go by way of having a strict appearance first and see where that goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3577.949s">A</a> fine this heavy, $300,000, is a pretty heavy fine to sell a gun that does not have a strict appearance to it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3587.578s">No,</a> I understand that, but I would suggest that that type of information be forwarded <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3592.055s">to</a> your subcommittee.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4033.818s">Mr.</a> President, this is not a new subject matter, at least for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4038.58s">And</a> it's getting more and more disturbing the more we keep thinking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4041.821s">I</a> first introduced this subject matter back on June 14, 2011. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4046.782s">First</a> time I introduced this idea of the bus stops in the square with an anticipation that there was going to be a lot of road work and bridge work and construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4054.627s">And</a> bringing forward, I have a whole folder here of not only resolutions, but I have a folder of information coming back and going forth, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4063.452s">No</a> resolution to the matter still as of yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4065.533s">And</a> then on June 30th of this year, resolution 15525, once again offered by myself, as it related not only to the bus stops, but a meeting with the DOT people, the MBTA, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4078.573s">letting</a> the governor of the Commonwealth know of our disappointment and our frustration over the idea of this bridge and its impact it's going to have here and the city of Medford, still no response. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4087.735s">I</a> asked the city clerk for a copy of the letter, never got a copy of the letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4091.496s">Then</a> again, on June 23rd of this, June, September, excuse me, on September 22nd of this year, I offered another resolution.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4101.119s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4104.88s">This</a> was June. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4106.295s">We're</a> talking about now September. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4107.715s">We</a> have had no meetings since June 30th to September. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4111.776s">As</a> a result of that, as a result of that in the Craddock Bridge, and I had asked you, Mr. President, on September 22nd to go forward and for the purposes of setting up a meeting with the MassDOT, letting them know and letting us know that we would have a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4127.279s">I</a> asked for a copy of the letter and apparently no letter was ever sent out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4131.462s">So</a> now, with no letters going out, and we're just sitting here spinning our wheels and just talking about something that's having a major effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4140.266s">Last</a> weekend, the downtown Medford Square, we were around 8, 7.30, 8, 9 o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4145.988s">Unbeknownst</a> to any business merchant down there, all of a sudden, everything was closed down because they were putting the bridge in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4150.81s">They</a> were putting the bridge in early in the night. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4153.271s">And</a> one particular business not only had it closed down and lost all his, probably, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4157.383s">$3,000</a> to $4,000 worth of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4160.625s">It</a> just doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4162.046s">Again,</a> it's a lack of transparency, a lack of communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4168.25s">What's</a> the sense of us having these resolutions? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4171.332s">You</a> turned around and told us last week, we're going to get it resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4174.695s">We</a> haven't gotten nothing resolved, Fred. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4176.796s">Nothing's</a> resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4177.877s">We</a> got no letters going out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4179.558s">We</a> have no meetings set up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4181.48s">And</a> we have bus concerns issues in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4184.221s">And</a> I believe it was last week, on one particular day, they even changed the buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4188.042s">And</a> people had to walk to Medford Square not knowing that the buses had been changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4192.683s">All</a> we're asking for is a little bit of common sense in this whole process of this Mystic, of this Kratik Bridge, you know, reconstruction, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4203.181s">And</a> another reason, if anybody's out there watching this whole thing, the reason it's taking two and a half years is because they don't work there every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4209.363s">They</a> were supposed to be working there six days a week, double shifts. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4212.224s">That</a> was the deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4213.164s">I</a> don't even know what that contract says if they're not doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4216.225s">But</a> once again, it's another typical City of Medford contract for 121 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4219.967s">121</a> feet is going to take two and a half years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4223.168s">With</a> the state of technology that's out there today, moving wires, telephone lines and gas lines, it just doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4230.34s">But</a> I'm more concerned over the fact, the abruptness that's going to take place once those buses have to be moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4236.925s">And</a> nobody has come to the city from the MassDOT, from the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4242.389s">No</a> letters have gone out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4243.55s">Council</a> resolutions have been ignored and not adhered to for the disposition of what takes place. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4248.834s">I</a> don't know what's going on, but I certainly hope that the next city council coming in has a better firm and a better grip on their own resolutions, because this is absolutely making no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4258.407s">We're</a> making resolutions and there's no action taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4261.428s">So</a> why are we making these resolutions? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4263.189s">Will</a> you tell me? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4265.29s">You</a> can't answer it, because I can't answer it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4267.671s">And</a> the fact of the matter is, this is what people elect us to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4270.872s">If</a> we're going to do the people's business and we're going to talk about it, at least do what our own business tells us to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4276.035s">At</a> least adhere to our own resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4278.476s">If</a> a letter went out to the MBTA and they ignored it, they didn't want to come back, or DOT, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4284.965s">You're</a> the chairperson of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4286.665s">The</a> letter should have gone out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4287.846s">And</a> the letter should have been addressed to the city clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4290.086s">It</a> should have gone out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4291.307s">And</a> if people are just getting lax around here and just letting resolutions come and go, well, then shame on everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4298.048s">That's</a> not what we're elected to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4300.089s">If</a> you owned a business in Medford Square, and you had to figure out when you woke up in the morning, you had to turn that key. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4305.83s">And</a> from the moment you turn that key, you've got to pay for the electric. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4309.071s">You've</a> got to pay for the gas. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4310.362s">You've</a> got to pay for the insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4311.842s">You've</a> got to pay for your stock. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4313.543s">You've</a> got to pay for your employees, workman's comp, every other thing that goes along with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4318.264s">And</a> then you come down and you have your business closed down or being given no information of when it's going to be closed down, no transparency, no communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4326.447s">Not</a> one person from this city building went down to Medford Square to tell those business merchants. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4331.728s">And</a> if the state was ignorant enough not to tell the business merchants or to tell the city hall, then the city should have been all over them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4338.582s">all</a> over them and they weren't. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4340.402s">But</a> this city council is just as much to blame because they didn't call the meeting that was supposed to be called from June of this year till again on September 22nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4348.604s">And</a> this is now November 17. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4351.065s">I'm</a> going to ask you, Mr. President, since it's obvious that the city clerk, would you please call this meeting ASAP? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4356.907s">You</a> said you were the last time we had this conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4359.607s">It</a> needs to be done before a business person goes out of business.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4385.57s">The</a> roll call vote, Mr. President, is going to be that the city, you, Mr. President, you call the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4391.052s">You</a> call the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4391.732s">You</a> get in touch with DOT. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4393.013s">You</a> get in call the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4394.439s">and</a> just tell them they've either been lax or they can use the excuse that they never got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4399.482s">We</a> need to have a meeting ASAP because there is a concern relative to the businesses in Medford Square and to the people of this community not knowing when and how these bus stops are going to be moved and where they're going to be moved.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4415.89s">Separate,</a> sever the motion, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4449.027s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4449.207s">What</a> about the MBTA, which is the bus stops?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4458.622s">Do</a> you have that in writing? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4459.462s">Do</a> you have a letter that you sent to them or is it just phone calls? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4462.444s">Phone</a> calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4463.004s">Phone</a> calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4463.384s">Well,</a> could you please put it in writing so we could have a paper trail that allows us now to do what we need to do for leverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4470.308s">Common</a> sense would tell you this is a business proposition. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4473.049s">This</a> isn't a social phone call to say, would you please come? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4476.671s">Listen,</a> they work for us, the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4478.878s">We</a> don't work for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4479.718s">They</a> work for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4481.259s">And</a> the bus stops are very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4483.32s">They're</a> important to not only to the commuters who use them every day, but they're also important to the business people that are in that square. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4489.642s">And</a> if they have to be moved.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4501.626s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4502.106s">The</a> Medford City Council is the only people that can move bus stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4505.147s">DOT</a> doesn't tell you they're going to move them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4506.568s">MBTA</a> doesn't tell you they're going to move them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4508.186s">You</a> need to have a discussion with them so they are aware of what we're going to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4511.568s">This</a> council has to agree amongst themselves where those bus stops are going to go, and they're going to have to adhere to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4517.892s">We've</a> been through this over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4519.653s">Any</a> move, Mr. President, that you include the MBTA at this meeting?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4530.68s">Do</a> you have the word MBTA in there, Madam Clerk? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4532.902s">DOT</a> and the MBTA?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4538.377s">Could</a> you, could you read the, could you read the motion please?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4566.899s">I'm</a> going to amend it further that it be in writing immediately ASAP. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4569.902s">This</a> has been going on since June 15th, so I think we'd like to have this in writing both to the DOT and the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4577.148s">You're</a> saying what, next Tuesday night? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4579.05s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4579.69s">You</a> just said December for, what is it, two weeks? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4582.993s">Is</a> that two weeks? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4583.894s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4584.515s">Thanksgiving's</a> next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4589.815s">Get</a> it?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4593.938s">Say</a> it again.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5728.459s">On</a> that motion, Rick is partially right on the idea of expanding the operating room. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5732.88s">But</a> the idea of expanding the operating room was also to go from three days to five days a week to take the transfers that have been going to the Melrose Wakefield back to the Lawrence Memorial Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5743.183s">About</a> a year and a half ago, they sort of like lost that influx of patient care for the operating room. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5752.786s">It's</a> been approximately 1,000 patients per year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5755.715s">according</a> to their records, which is holding their own. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5758.276s">And</a> by doing that, they talked about block time, for which doctors have the opportunity to block time in the operating room. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5765.398s">I</a> think it starts from 730 in the morning to 3 o'clock in the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5768.899s">And</a> that block time will allow certain types of operations, or more operations, that for which they had to give up before, that went to the Melrose-Wakefield. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5778.622s">They</a> also talked about the idea of the surgical volume <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5784.873s">possibly</a> right now looking at 2016, it's approximately going to be the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5793.698s">The</a> question that seems to be having a problem with the hospital and all the hospitals is that a lot of the patients coming in are not paying the patient's care, what do you call it, their co-payment. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5805.003s">And</a> some of these co-payments are kind of like high. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5807.685s">And</a> as a result of that, some of these patients are opting out not to have the operations now or waiting to a later date. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5815.553s">So</a> in essence, maybe the patient care volume is down, it's not because the patients don't want to do it, they just can't afford to do it or their co-payments are too high. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5824.375s">Now</a> we're into the insurance part of the whole program and that in and of itself presents another thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5829.035s">Getting</a> back to the idea of where this merger sits, one of the interesting components of the merger, hopefully the merger takes place, is the Lawrence Memorial Partners really wants the Lawrence Memorial Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5840.457s">It's</a> accessibility to 93, it's a perfect match and it's a perfect fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5844.724s">And</a> as a result of that, one of the two big stumbling blocks with the attorney general was this idea of licensure. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5853.071s">And</a> one of the things that held back the last merger was there was no definition of when this first five, six years of the merger taking place, when the licensure would become operative and effective. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5869.026s">And</a> hopefully, it becomes effective as soon <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5872.743s">as</a> partners makes this merge go through if the training general allows it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5875.644s">With</a> that being said, that'll just put the Lawrence Memorial right on the map all over again as a hospital completely affiliated with partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5884.407s">The</a> doctors, they were pretty interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5885.868s">The</a> interesting part about it is that they had a lot of interesting questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5890.41s">And</a> some of the questions, they questioned about what was going on and as to why, because there's a lot of changes taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5896.612s">So</a> they just didn't sit there like a lump on a log. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5899.433s">which</a> was very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5900.814s">They</a> were inquisitive, and they wanted to know some of the answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5903.536s">And</a> some of their questions couldn't be answered, which was even better. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5906.118s">So</a> people are going to have to get back to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5908.36s">There's</a> no question you see a new movement up there at the hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5911.342s">Hopefully,</a> it's enough to keep it going. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5914.124s">It</a> may not be able to keep it going with all its services. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5916.446s">But</a> if the OR room can bring itself back, and this block time of operations can take place up there, as Rick alluded to with the other things going on, the hospital should do itself well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5927.014s">People</a> should understand that the Lawrence Memorial Hospital <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5929.608s">was</a> a very financially endowed hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5932.949s">And</a> when that merger took place between Hallmark and the Lawrence Memorial Hospital and Melrose-Wakefield came into the picture, and unfortunately I think the Malden Hospital was part of it, and of course it's no longer there, that's when the finances of the Lawrence Memorial Hospital and their bankroll became depleted. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5947.712s">I</a> think at one point in time they had a $34 million <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5951.404s">asset</a> profit margin. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5952.645s">Now,</a> I believe they're in the minus column. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5956.008s">Getting</a> better, but still not out of the woods yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5958.43s">So,</a> hopefully, as we keep moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5961.773s">One</a> of the best things the people of this community can do, if you are a patient or you know a doctor at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital, make the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5968.559s">Find</a> out what you can do to send that letter in, whether it be to the Attorney General or to the Mass General. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5972.683s">Tell</a> them that you want to keep the hospital, you like their services, and as Rick alluded to, with the new services coming on board, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5979.545s">And</a> again, their whole transportation needs, their 30-minute response period time for an ambulance, and putting everybody on call and on notice, it's going to be unacceptable if they don't meet the requirements that the hospital is asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5993.075s">They'll</a> be out of a job. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5994.396s">So,</a> with that being said, Mr. President, hopefully this is the beginning of more transparency that the hospital has had. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6000.381s">It</a> hasn't had this in a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6002.342s">These</a> doctors, men and women that were there, and the doctor in charge, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6005.549s">seem</a> to be wanting to do the right thing, and I want to thank them for inviting us.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6163.772s">Did</a> you make inquiry to the school committee to have this joint meeting?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6167.252s">Who</a> did you make inquiry with to have the joint meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6169.913s">I</a> didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6170.613s">Who</a> did?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6176.68s">I</a> don't understand this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6177.92s">It's</a> a council prerogative to make the inquiry. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6180.761s">Number</a> one. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6181.181s">Number</a> two, I believe the superintendent had some comments about it last night at the school committee meeting where he said that this wasn't done to keep it hush hush before the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6189.224s">Well,</a> I don't know what it was or why it wasn't, but it took place six days before the election, you know, and the teachers never responded and never called the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6198.007s">Police</a> department wasn't called. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6199.207s">And</a> it's the same situation they had up to high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6201.681s">when</a> they had a bomb scare and nobody knew nothing about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6204.303s">And</a> they wouldn't allow the dogs to come into the building because they didn't want the adverse publicity. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6208.506s">You</a> know, this is the problem around here, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6210.908s">You're</a> asked to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6211.968s">That's</a> a huge issue that took place in that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6214.73s">Someone</a> got into that school building, could have kidnapped a kid, could have caused harm, could have done something that we're seeing every single day, devastation taking place in public places. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6226.198s">And</a> they got to think about having a joint meeting to discuss the public safety of a building <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6231.935s">What</a> are they afraid of, a hard question being asked? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6235.216s">You</a> know, I don't accept this, Mr. President, and I wouldn't hope that you would call tomorrow morning and just tell them, listen, this meeting is taking place next Tuesday night to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6243.58s">You</a> know, we vote on their budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6245.701s">We</a> vote on their budget that they submit to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6250.563s">And</a> if they can't be responsible enough to want to meet with another legislative body who is ready, willing, and able to help out the situation, they have no security in the schools, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6261.768s">One</a> thing, Chris Murphy, when he was running for school committee, that's what he was advocating for. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6265.571s">He's</a> the only one running for school committee that advocated for security, or lack thereof, in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6270.535s">And</a> we're still talking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6272.717s">Shame</a> on every elected official, the superintendent, the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6275.9s">Shame</a> on you all for not wanting to sit down by now to have even a date set up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6280.503s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6333.729s">We</a> already voted on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6336.631s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_s9uJGZJhvT8/2025-03-21_s9uJGZJhvT8.html">Medford City Council - November 10, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=152.741s">I</a> think when we look around our community and we decide to have people serve on particular boards and commissions, it becomes very important that the people are involved within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=161.405s">And</a> Fred Lasky most definitely is involved in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=164.659s">not</a> only as a former school committee person, as a former Boy Scout leader, but also as years in government and also as years in working here within our community and participating in many, many functions. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=175.688s">So</a> I think it's what a nice, decent piece of honor to not only represent the fact that I would like to co-sponsor with Councilor Camuso, the appointment of Mr. Lasky. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=186.598s">I</a> just think it's, it's another good turn for our city as we move forward in a positive way. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=191.422s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1038.617s">Uh,</a> chair recognizes Councilor Penta this past March. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1041.959s">I</a> attended the, uh, water and soil commission when they first introduced this idea of having a monitoring system take place here within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1049.926s">And</a> inclusive of that, there was a company, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1052.747s">that</a> was coming forward and made a presentation as it relates to addressing any and all leaks throughout the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1058.348s">I'm</a> not being a voluntary participant. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1061.169s">Um,</a> so the difference between that one and this one, um, is, is a little bit different. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1065.809s">And</a> as council max is alluded to, I think it would be great to have them come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1069.11s">So</a> all the taxpayers and the rate payers would have a better understanding as to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1074.311s">As</a> far as having the program, that's going to have the capacity and the ability to, to detect leaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1080.037s">One</a> of the things that was paramount in this whole program was that spike periods of time, either during the day or during the night, would be recorded here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1089.345s">And</a> as a result of that, whoever would be monitoring or whatever office would be handling this, they would be able to get a printout, they would be able to identify the time, and that would in turn be able to notify the ratepayer homeowner who would be having this particular problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1105.325s">As</a> Councilor Marks alluded to, there are astronomical bills that have been going out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1108.606s">I've</a> sat there where people have had $1,000, $2,000 bills because of a little bit of a leak. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1114.348s">We</a> were told, I believe, when we bought the system at that point in time that the software to be included was about approximately $100,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1122.41s">That</a> was inclusive of having a person in the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1125.191s">So</a> I don't know how much that broke itself down to the employee and to the software, but if we had that, <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1130.831s">we</a> probably wouldn't be in the position now of talking about people who have these outrageous bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1135.354s">But</a> I don't think it's just a $12,000 system, since it's going to be voluntary. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1140.657s">So</a> I don't know how that's going to represent every single house in the community to ask people to be a participant. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1146.04s">But</a> I think what would be beneficial is to have them come down here, because they're going to tell you that the tier system that they're working off of right now hasn't worked apparently the way they thought it would work. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1156.226s">First,</a> it was the first 800 would get a certain rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1159.195s">and</a> then up to 1,200, then up to 1,200. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1160.916s">Now</a> it's the first thousand, and then after the first thousand cubic feet, and it goes on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1166.14s">So</a> I think what the council and the rate payers really need to understand is looking at the volume of how much water is used by those people. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1173.445s">Now</a> when we talk about the conservation part of the program, you're also talking about what the EPA, through the federal government, is mandating as for the amount of per gallons per day, per individual, I think it's like 65. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1185.714s">And</a> if we look at that and multiply that, <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1188.418s">in</a> each individual household, you'll have an idea of how much water should be used or is going to be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1195.039s">That,</a> in and of itself, will send out a tier amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1199.3s">Right</a> now, it's 800. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1200.0s">I</a> don't know what it's going to go to once the water commissioners sit down and talk about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1206.102s">Now,</a> to a lot of people, this might sound like, wow, this is way over their head. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1209.602s">And</a> it probably is, because if you think about it, when you're talking about cubic feet, <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1213.347s">and</a> the cost per cubic feet, it is a lot to think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1216.849s">But</a> if we're talking about almost $7 million, if not more, that we have in the water and sewer enterprise surplus account, that money definitely should be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1224.553s">There</a> is nothing on the books that's demanding the exact use of that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1228.055s">And</a> more importantly, if, in fact, that money has to be taken out to offset whatever the increased cost is this year until they can figure out what the exact cost is going to be on the cubic feet, whatever the dollar amount might be, is it 800, 900, 1,000 cubic feet? <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1242.81s">then</a> so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1244.011s">The</a> ratepayers need to have this understood, but they need to come up and speak up about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1249.493s">They</a> should not have to pay one red cent in any increase in water and sewer bill, not one red cent. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1254.755s">This</a> city is sitting on their money, approximately $7.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1260.318s">That's</a> an awful lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1261.819s">They</a> haven't spent that money in a long period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1264.66s">So</a> don't let anybody confuse you or fool you or make you think that you have to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1269.822s">City</a> has that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1270.743s">It's</a> your money. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1271.838s">let</a> them pay for it out of the water and sewer account, let them figure out what the money, what the cubic feet cost needs to be, and you move on from that period. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1279.303s">So,</a> I thank you, Councilor Marks, for bringing that forward.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1618.203s">Mr.</a> President, this is the very first time that we've been getting this. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1621.365s">We</a> got nothing in our packet of explanation. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1624.126s">So</a> I'm going to utilize a rule 20 of our council rules, which basically says that any financial paper appearing on the council agenda for the first time shall be automatically laid on the table for one week when one such action is requested by any one councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1638.155s">So</a> I'm going to move to the paper lay on the table and we have some explanation between now and next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1642.557s">So</a> on motion of the table by councilor.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1646.27s">It's</a> automatic.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1650.851s">No,</a> it's automatic. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1652.272s">The</a> rule says it's automatic. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1653.412s">Anyone</a> counts. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1654.032s">It's</a> totally on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1656.613s">Very</a> good.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1746.009s">This</a> is the first time that this is... We haven't introduced that for discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1749.832s">You</a> just mentioned the carriage house. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1751.274s">That's</a> the next one in line. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1752.815s">She</a> just said it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1756.318s">You</a> just got through talking about the first one, which is the city ads. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1760.121s">Now</a> we're talking about the carriage house. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1761.923s">Did</a> you not mention the carriage house?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1766.167s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1790.193s">So</a> 15, 735.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1828.862s">Mr.</a> President, I will move at this point in time that rule 20 section four be invoked since it's appearing on the council for the first time and it takes one council to automatically lay it on the table.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1857.534s">Likewise,</a> taking rule order number 20, section 4, preparing for the first time this particular amount, this particular paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=1864.26s">I</a> move that the paper lay on the table.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2037.203s">Thank</a> you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2039.144s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2040.324s">One</a> of the things that's very disturbing is the fact that somebody actually got into that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2044.666s">How</a> and why they got through locked doors, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2047.036s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2047.676s">Number</a> two, the six teachers that were involved that had their pocketbooks rifled during the course of the school day, you know, presents a very unsettling and uncomfortable situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2057.32s">The</a> unfortunate part about it, no police presence, no police were called. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2061.922s">Superintendent's</a> office, again, speaking of — let's just put it this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2068.604s">Superintendent's</a> office did not come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2071.545s">The</a> argument was it was just before an election. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2073.766s">They</a> didn't want people to think that their schools weren't safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2076.28s">You</a> know, it's a scary situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2078.001s">The</a> incident actually took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2079.522s">You</a> can't deny it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2080.342s">You</a> can't hide from it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2082.023s">You</a> know, there was one candidate running for school committee, Chris Murphy, and that was one of the things he was pounding upon, the lack of school security and the need for school security. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2089.948s">And</a> you couldn't have it more prevalent now. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2091.95s">And</a> it's unfortunate that it was covered up before the election, when, in fact, it took place the week prior to the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2098.053s">So,</a> with that being said, it's an absolute concern not only for the teachers, but for the students, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2103.267s">Could</a> have been some nutcake could have gone into that building and done anything that they wanted to that could have harmed the teachers, the students, and the building in and of itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2111.451s">And</a> it's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2112.632s">You</a> just spent over $500,000 to hire five new administrators up at that school at $94,000 each this past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2120.937s">I</a> don't know what they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2122.838s">But</a> it certainly isn't doing to protect the school kids' safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2126.34s">It</a> has nothing to do with hiring new school teachers or buying supplies or looking even into a security system. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2132.083s">It's</a> wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2133.868s">You</a> know, this school administration really needs to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2136.649s">And</a> the new school committee coming in, I hope they do a good hard look at how these schools and how their budget is being processed. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2142.552s">Because,</a> you know, you can't keep going on with this and hiding and covering up everything that's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2149.334s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Patu.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2454.501s">One</a> quick thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2455.281s">I</a> mean, if there's ever a time to bring both bodies together, this would be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2458.943s">I</a> would suggest a joint meeting between the school committee and the city council take place just because it took place at a school. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2464.666s">Who's</a> to say it can't take place in this building right here or any public works building anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2470.248s">This</a> is a huge wake up call. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2472.449s">Do</a> you realize the kid could have been kidnapped? <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2474.811s">Could</a> have been hurt. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2476.972s">We</a> have no idea what the potential is, but it's obvious. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2480.783s">It's</a> unfortunate in this day and age we have to act like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2483.465s">But</a> if we have to act like this to protect what we have, and that's the kids and the teachers and the people who work around here, then we have a responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2491.209s">That's</a> what they're paying taxes for, believing and hoping that their children are being safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2495.992s">I'm</a> going to move, Mr. President, that a joint meeting take place between the school committee and the council as it relates to security in the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2503.376s">And</a> maybe we can address our own public buildings at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2506.918s">This</a> is not going to go away.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2925.592s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2926.552s">One</a> of the things I think you really need to look at is the unfortunate part that this administration has not been able to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2932.913s">This</a> is three years in a row we've been talking about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2935.174s">And</a> as a matter of fact, this has become more and more of an issue ever since we got these green barrels on waste management because it's changed the whole type of pickup that's being taking place here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2945.117s">Had</a> this administration had the foresight <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2947.526s">to</a> recognize that it isn't twice a year the streets need to be swept. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2950.808s">When</a> you can go to our sister city of Somerville, they sweep every other week, odd, even, odd, even. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2955.491s">They</a> let the people know it's in their telephone bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2957.793s">I</a> strike that it's in their tax bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2960.435s">They</a> let them know ahead of time what the game plan is. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2962.896s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2963.697s">I</a> would hope that the new administration comes in as understanding that these are serious problems that have an impact on the taxpayers here within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2972.282s">It's</a> obvious that the present administration doesn't want to address it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2975.08s">The</a> council has addressed it, and they've been right spot on with this thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2978.421s">The</a> unfortunate part about it is, whether it's a week earlier or a week late, that's not the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2982.803s">The</a> fact of the matter is, what are you having up to that point in time? <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2986.165s">You</a> can't turn around and say, well, we're going to give you an extra week of leaf pickup, but we're going to take away something else, because this is what we have with the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2995.789s">Contrary</a> to what all the councillors know, the president administration re-upped the contract for another 10 years, two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3001.691s">The</a> council was never informed of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3003.979s">So</a> with that being said, as it relates to our rubbish pickup, you just got through building a new building for $14.5 million, and you still are only able to do the street sweeping twice a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3013.843s">It</a> makes no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3016.204s">Where</a> is the program that should be out there that addresses matters such as this? <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3021.326s">They</a> don't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3022.167s">You're</a> still talking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3023.707s">You're</a> still talking about the potential for the danger, as Councilor Camuso just alluded to. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3028.149s">What</a> if it rains, snows, or whatever it might be, the ice, the skidding? <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3031.39s">These</a> are all potential things. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3032.927s">And</a> these are the things that should be talked about and discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3035.828s">This</a> is what a good manager does. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3037.308s">He</a> brings his department heads in, be it a woman or a man, and they discuss these things that are going to have a definite impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3044.349s">Right</a> now, it's obvious that no discussion has taken place, and we're right back to where we were three years ago coming forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3052.071s">And</a> now, all you can hope for is you hope that it doesn't snow, and Mother Nature is going to just do its things, and the city is foolishly going out there right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3060.667s">Well,</a> the question should be, why do you have to go out there right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3063.769s">If</a> the city owns the Sweet Streeper and not knowing how much of that's an outside person, why don't we just wait until the leaves are down and then go out there? <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3072.836s">But</a> that's too much of a thought process because I don't think it's going to exist in this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3077.14s">I</a> would hope that the new council and the new mayor has an understanding that these are issues, these are everyday, common sense, practical issues that should be addressed in a common sense manner.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3600.87s">Chair</a> recognizes Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3603.692s">Mr.</a> Mulkey, look up in the ceiling. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3606.494s">Sit</a> there.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3608.455s">It's</a> two and a half years. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3609.856s">What's</a> going on?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3653.007s">I</a> thought Mr. President, when Louise Miller was here a few weeks ago, she indicated that the bids are going out and they were, they were supposed to be doing now. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3661.475s">So</a> all you have right now is the scope of work that needs to be done?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3668.418s">Do</a> you have an estimate of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3669.319s">What</a> that scope is anticipated to be?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3683.244s">Can,</a> can that be fixed without the roof?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3707.76s">So</a> we're just saying that approximately 1.5, or whatever that number finally turns out to be, is going to be an expenditure going to be coming out <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3715.078s">this</a> year, the 2016 budget, is that true, Ann? <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3718.4s">Was</a> that where the money would have to come from? <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3720.842s">Or</a> a bond or something?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3726.966s">Whatever</a> that dollar amount is in excess of.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3731.049s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Knight.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3769.184s">I</a> think there was. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3770.825s">No,</a> it wasn't free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3773.385s">It</a> was an improvement program, so to speak, with a multitude of issues, and that was one of them.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3779.407s">We</a> did.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3803.069s">No,</a> it couldn't be for free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3804.429s">Cause</a> if that, we wouldn't even be discussing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3806.369s">What</a> we're talking about money that was allegedly put aside and that was that and the parapet was all part of it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3816.291s">I'm</a> pretty sure it was a bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3821.367s">Move</a> approval.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3834.351s">Let</a> the record reflect, uh, Paul, have I understood this correctly? <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3838.052s">This,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3839.468s">$2,000</a> is going to come out of this 2016 maintenance account that you have here. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3843.73s">Yes,</a> that's correct.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3845.451s">Could</a> the record please reflect that? <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3846.812s">It</a> doesn't say it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3860.959s">No,</a> it's the building department, not city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3863.12s">Building</a> department.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3864.281s">Building</a> department maintenance account. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3865.942s">For</a> maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=3866.842s">Building</a> department maintenance account.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4703.639s">Today</a> I attended the Traffic Commission meeting, and this issue was brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4707.941s">As</a> a result of bringing it up, there was a lady there from Park Medford, a lovely lady, and unfortunately she wasn't in the decision-making process. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4715.723s">She</a> would take it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4717.184s">I</a> did bring up <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4718.217s">The</a> resolution that Councilor Marks introduced some months ago regarding the 15 minutes, which would came down to 15 minutes before and after. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4725.84s">And</a> again, there was no answer to that other than we're working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4729.162s">And</a> I don't know how long they're going to work on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4731.303s">I</a> think the more you start to take away from Park Medford, the more they're going to push back because they're either going to tell you the City of Medford won't take its share of the 32% as compared to what they're supposed to be getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4744.689s">The</a> other part of that, which is now going to be very interesting, <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4747.951s">During</a> this last campaign for mayor, the newly elected mayor indicated that she was going to have a senior program that would allow seniors to park for nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4760.276s">And</a> if seniors were to park for nothing here in the city of Medford, that's another financial issue that Park Medford is going to have to take into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4767.42s">And</a> there was also the thought process of giving seniors $1,000 rebate on their real estate insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4772.942s">I</a> mean, these are huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4775.624s">financial</a> impact issues here for the city of Medford to deal with. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4779.106s">So</a> I would hope that the new incoming council and those of you that are returning have a better understanding of what's going on because you're making a serious financial impact, not only on Park Medford, but you're making it also on the city of Medford's financial stability. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4793.552s">And</a> I think it's something that needs to be addressed seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4796.994s">If</a> the city of Medford, in fact, wants to go to free parking in December, I don't know how you're going to do it because I don't know who's going to pay the price for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4805.014s">I'm</a> quite sure that if I were Park Medford, I would tell you, I'm not going to give you anything because you're telling me, you know, you want to have free parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4812.16s">So</a> what's their end of the bargain? <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4813.561s">It's</a> not in the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4814.942s">So</a> something's going to have to be mitigated for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4817.084s">And</a> I would hope this council goes back and reads the contract and looks at the areas in the contract that you are specifically obligated for and to. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4825.991s">Same</a> thing with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4827.172s">I</a> don't see any month. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4828.473s">Sounds</a> like a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4829.654s">These</a> are all nice for the purposes of having it, <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4834.418s">But</a> it's a financial impact for both parties. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4837.839s">City,</a> Annisville Park, Medford City, it's great for the patrons. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4841.34s">It's</a> great for the business. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4843.041s">And</a> it'll actually serve a purpose, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4845.502s">The</a> purpose it'll serve is you really didn't need the kiosks, and you didn't need the meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4849.863s">If</a> you're going to allow these people to park for nothing, and you have a two-hour traffic enforcement time period, what a way to really see what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4857.206s">But</a> you won't see that happen, because it doesn't seem to be that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4860.507s">But</a> I will tell you this. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4862.096s">There</a> is an impact that will be felt on both sides, and I don't know who's going to win on this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4867.32s">Unfortunately,</a> I don't think the taxpayer's going to win on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4869.502s">It's</a> a great idea, but somebody's going to have to pay for it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4889.799s">Mr.</a> President, some five weeks ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4891.708s">I</a> put a resolution on the council calendar as it relates to the bus stops in Medford Square, where they were going, and as a result of the Craddock Bridge construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4900.091s">Now,</a> I haven't heard anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4901.872s">I</a> thought you were going to do something about it as the chairperson of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4906.314s">I</a> have received no letter, no correspondence from anybody as it relates to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4910.536s">It</a> doesn't make any sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4912.376s">We</a> just went through an uncomfortable situation in South Medford two weeks ago as it relates to bus stops over there that seemed to be a problematic situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4921.547s">possibly</a> they need to be removed or resolved to allow businesses to operate and have the residents in a better position and a more of a comfortable position between the two. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4932.476s">Now</a> we have this past Saturday evening, unbeknownst to anyone, they decided to come in and drop the bridge in Medford Square without letting any of the business folks know what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4942.384s">I</a> have no idea of what's going on here in this city as it relates to this kratik bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4946.928s">We</a> have not been apprised. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4948.51s">Last</a> week, <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4951.747s">There</a> was no notice to anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4953.049s">No</a> notice to the police department, no notice to the Office of Community Development. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4956.372s">If</a> the mayor knew about it, well, good luck to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4959.254s">The</a> bottom line to this is you can't operate a city the way it's going. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4965.259s">It</a> just continuously gets worse and worse and worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4968.963s">The</a> biggest thing that's going to interrupt business development in Medford Square is taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4974.688s">Bus</a> stops are not even being looked at or resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4977.43s">The</a> MBTA, if you sent the letter out, Mr. Finn, I don't know, you said you did, if you sent the letter out and they haven't responded and there's been no follow-up, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4985.633s">I</a> don't know who to blame on this one here right now because all I can tell you is the city council's been on top of this, on top of this on behalf of the business merchants. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4993.176s">The</a> chamber hasn't been notified, the council hasn't been notified, OCD hasn't been notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=4997.825s">Last</a> week we talked about the rats as a result of the construction over here on the businesses on Riverside Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5004.869s">Again,</a> no discussion on that, nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5007.41s">Where's</a> the mitigation to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5008.831s">And</a> that should have been a huge mitigation by the city of Medford with the contractor on those rats, because any time you disturb water and the foundation of the water is around it, you know you're going to be involved with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5019.076s">And</a> for them to turn around and say you can't get mitigation, that's BS in plain English. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5023.93s">So,</a> Mr. President, I'm asking you once again, immediately, through you, I don't know what the city clerk, I don't know what the letter, we never got a copy of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5030.614s">I</a> don't know why they're not responding to the city of Medford to come here to discuss the bus stops, because those bus stops in Medford Square need to be discussed and action needs to be taken immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5042.101s">And</a> I believe, as the records will indicate, we ask them also to come and take a look at South Medford, because they have a similar problem in a different way. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5050.166s">So</a> we can do kill two birds with one stone. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5052.668s">So</a> I'm employing upon you, Mr. President, to call tomorrow morning and have them here within the next week, because this is making no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5060.293s">And</a> it's unfair for a business person to lose money having their business be interrupted at 8, 9 o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5068.318s">Main</a> Street was shut off without notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5070.9s">I</a> understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5071.9s">But</a> to have this done and no notification, <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5074.552s">That</a> just tells you that there is no professionalism in this bridge, there is absolutely no communication, and there's no public awareness as it relates to the public safety part of it, public health and public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5086.06s">So,</a> Mr. Finn, you said you sent the letter out. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5088.422s">I</a> never saw a copy of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5089.463s">We're</a> running five weeks now. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5091.144s">I</a> don't know what it takes to move these people, but I would appreciate it, Mr. President.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5121.646s">What's</a> the date that you sent the letter out? <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5123.086s">No,</a> this is table. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5124.326s">This</a> is still in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5125.907s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5126.387s">The</a> Medford city council voted almost four to five weeks ago to have the MBTA come to the city method for the purposes <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5132.217s">of</a> coming to here. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5133.218s">We</a> didn't table anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5134.498s">I</a> believe the council voted seven to nothing.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5140.361s">No,</a> no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5141.022s">This</a> is the letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5141.702s">I'm</a> asking you the copy of the letter that you sent out from the council asking them to come.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5204.955s">Point</a> of correction. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5205.776s">Point</a> of correction. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5206.416s">What</a> Councilor Knight is alluding to is the resolution that was passed last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5209.738s">I'm</a> talking about the one that the council separately voted on five weeks ago and the letter was sent out relative to Medford Square and the bus stops.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5222.93s">Do</a> I have the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5226.533s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5227.333s">It</a> was a separate resolution five weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5229.555s">The</a> council voted seven to nothing to have it go to the tee. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5232.901s">For</a> the lady to come here, the lady representative, to come here and discuss the bus stops in Medford Square, where it's going. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5237.484s">Everything</a> else that was talked about was brought up last week as an addendum. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5241.707s">And</a> if we notice it, the very last thing on it also included Medford Square, because we haven't had an answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5246.771s">So</a> I'm asking, Mr. Clerk, what's the copy? <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5249.073s">You</a> have a copy of the letter that was sent out from five weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5252.035s">We'll</a> get to the bottom of this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5254.196s">No,</a> no, I want to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5255.237s">I'd</a> like to have a copy of the letter, because if the letter hasn't been sent out, we've got a problem here.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5300.482s">So</a> we will also invite Mr. Moki. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5304.945s">next</a> week at six o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5306.046s">What</a> are we doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5306.826s">You</a> doing the committee of the whole also for the bus stops or not?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5321.434s">If</a> I remember correctly, two weeks ago when we had that, I asked you for an update and you turned to the clerk and you asked the clerk said you still haven't had a response back yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=5329.852s">That</a> goes back to the first.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_ysQghC7EzOg/2025-03-21_ysQghC7EzOg.html">Medford City Council - October 27, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=438.298s">Regarding</a> these bus stop locations, Mr. President, there seems to be an ongoing concern as it relates to traffic into the business part of the community of Main Street into the South Medford area over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=450.425s">And</a> the bus stops have continuously kept coming up after speaking with some of the business merchants on maybe looking at them, maybe moving them or readjusting their locations and taking that into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=462.071s">And</a> I think it was almost a month ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=464.573s">The</a> council asked for the T to come down to the city council as it relates to Medford Square and the Kratik Bridge and the moving of the bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=472.456s">Have</a> you heard anything yet?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=497.348s">Well,</a> relative to the bus stops, I'd like to include this in there because before this becomes a problem that's probably not needed, maybe just have a look and see as to where the bus stops might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=508.593s">Maybe</a> they can be rearranged, move around because there's a serious problem as it relates to the commercial part of <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=514.728s">trucks</a> coming down there loading and unloading. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=516.87s">And,</a> um, I just think it needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=520.813s">It's</a> been discussed in the past, but I think it's gotten to the point right now it needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=525.076s">All</a> those businesses down there, it's full occupancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=527.698s">So</a> there's some concerns relative to the safety and to the locations for where trucks can make deposits and during the course of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=536.085s">So</a> I just think, um, I don't know why it takes so long for the T to come here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=540.929s">Do</a> you? <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=542.974s">The</a> bus drops are in the control of the council.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2596.634s">During</a> this past week, Mr. President, I was contacted by some of the tenants that live on work, excuse me, on the commercial pieces of property on Riverside Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2606.716s">And</a> as a result of the Craddock Bridge being reconstructed at the present time, there's been an ongoing weekly rodent problem that's continuing to exist, which is costing <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2618.689s">a</a> considerable amount of money, not only to the owners of the property, but it's going to eventually come down to the renters because they are the ones that are feeling it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2625.453s">Um,</a> I'd like to get a report back from the, um, board of public health on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2629.395s">And</a> at the same time, this was one of the things that we brought up as to why something called mitigation couldn't have been taken into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2636.699s">Having</a> the forethought to recognize that a situation like this could happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2641.082s">Um,</a> I think it's unfortunate that it is happening, but it has an effect on not only the business owners, but the renters. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2647.407s">And</a> their custom is, it's a daily cost, it's a weekly cost, and it's an ongoing cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2652.089s">And</a> I don't think that they should be the ones that should have to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2655.09s">So</a> I move that forward, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2657.411s">I</a> also move that to the city solicitor's office to have them investigate and figure out if there's a way that the city, in behalf of the property owners, can retrieve financial remuneration for what they're going through as a result of this bridge.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2699.203s">What's</a> interesting about this resolve is the fact that the young lady, not only having been a well-recognized teacher within our Medford public school system, and she also has this ability to deal with students that need to speak from other languages as it relates to interacting with English. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2715.348s">I</a> had the unique opportunity this past week to address a special class up at the high school as it relates to government as we speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2724.199s">but</a> the recognition of other teachers within the building and what they can do and how they're being recognized seems to be something that's not ongoing on a daily basis, or strike at, or on any kind of a basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2736.147s">There</a> is a huge, there is a huge inventory of teacher talent that exists in our method public school systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2742.431s">And</a> this young lady, Teresa Castagnetti, is one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2746.334s">It's</a> sort of like an unrecognized hero, because on a daily basis, she has to deal with a bunch of students, once again, speakers of other languages, <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2754.333s">And</a> to some teachers or to some students, that can be a hard interaction. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2758.957s">But</a> she seems to work it well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2760.839s">She's</a> recognized for it as the Teacher of the Year from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2764.722s">So</a> I think she deserves a public acknowledgement for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2767.124s">And</a> also at the same time, on many occasions, her husband, sitting out in the audience, speaks as it relates to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2775.131s">So</a> he's blessed to have a wife who has this type of ability and to be recognized for receiving this award. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2782.68s">So</a> I move the question, and hopefully, again, it sets a nice tempo for teachers within the school system to know that they can and they are being recognized for the work that they do.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3183.255s">One</a> of the things that the bill addresses, it goes back to 2007, where it takes in particular an age group between the ages of 15 and 19, which basically represented 4.3%. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3196.138s">So</a> I'm assuming, I would have to assume that since 2007 coming forward, as we all know, that has greatly increased. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3204.599s">The</a> one thing that's disturbing, I think, in this press release is the fact where it states in the study conducted in 2014, <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3211.178s">The</a> National Institute of Drug Abuse found that nearly 1 in 30 high school seniors had abused oxycodone. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3216.561s">Now,</a> when you say 1 in 30 high school students, I mean, just look at Medford High in and of itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3222.224s">I</a> mean, I can't believe that 1 in 30 of every one of those high school kids uses it or abused it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3228.667s">And</a> I think the damning effect, when you make press releases like that, I don't know how Medford High gets itself involved into the national statistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3239.132s">Adam,</a> you had statistics there for the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3241.833s">And</a> I don't know if the state was broken down by each city and town, because these responses had to come from students who readily admitted and acknowledged that they either used it or abused it or were on it, one or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3252.678s">And</a> I just don't want people to think, when they hear 1 in 30, that that represents Medford High School as well, because it's a national statistic that took place in 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3263.102s">We</a> know we have a problem here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3265.203s">We</a> know we have some. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3266.474s">I</a> think it's an excessive 84 deaths over the last five years, and it is a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3272.817s">But</a> I just don't want people to think that our high school is lumped into this national drug survey that's unsubstantiated. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3282.663s">I</a> think it's an unfair commentary.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3355.465s">I</a> would happen to think, Mr. President, that the students in our city and the parents in our city that unfortunately might have children that are either using it or have been abused from using it had to go through that suffering. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3369.148s">But</a> I cannot believe that one out of every 30 students or one out of every students in the classroom is either using it or abusing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3375.936s">And</a> sometimes statistics can leave you in a different way. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3378.679s">As</a> a matter of fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3379.81s">The</a> press release is even different than that for which is being presented from 2012 to 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3384.193s">Councilor</a> Knight can have his opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3387.456s">I</a> have mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3388.216s">And,</a> uh, I just think that one particular statistic, um, doesn't vote well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3392.419s">I</a> think it's a, uh, a false representation of every school district and every school throughout this entire country where they got these statistics. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3400.045s">I</a> don't know that method city, um, people from the city of Medford that families and students become part of it, that they take part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3406.51s">I</a> don't know, but I just think it's a, <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3408.905s">an</a> unfair commentary to make that one in 30 high school seniors have either used it or abused it or run it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=6489.581s">Point</a> of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=6490.282s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=6490.622s">When</a> you talked about matching funds being matching, can you explain?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=6503.827s">The</a> percentage.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=6541.779s">It</a> was disclosed at the meeting that we had, and I don't know if you were there or not, at a Committee of the Whole meeting this year, and the state has already acknowledged it's 18%. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=6547.882s">It</a> went from 31% down to 18%. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=6551.263s">And</a> that's providing that they can balance the budget for this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=6554.324s">So</a> it's 18% coming back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=6556.605s">And</a> the city will be paying, the taxpayers will be paying, if they vote for this, 1.5% on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=6562.627s">So</a> it's not a complete match. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=6564.268s">You're</a> only going to get 18% back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=6566.428s">That's</a> what needs to be clarified.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=6593.473s">I</a> understand that, but the fact of the matter is, I think it needs to be understood and clarified. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=6598.874s">We're</a> not investing stocks here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=6600.975s">You're</a> talking about taxpayers' money, and this is not a complete match with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=8168.577s">Councilman</a> Penta? <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=8169.418s">I</a> think you need to explain National Guardsmen because we have all kinds of branches of the service. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=8174.062s">These</a> people that are in reserves, these active duty people or what? <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=8177.085s">They</a> would be reservists that are deployed.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_UdTpFX1NL7M/2025-03-21_UdTpFX1NL7M.html">Medford City Council - October 20, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=935.988s">I'll</a> let the gentleman speak first.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2677.349s">Some</a> years ago, excuse me, so many years ago, Shaviro Auditorium could have possibly been non-existent here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2684.754s">You</a> may remember this. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2685.635s">When</a> they were cutting up the old Medford High School, Shaviro Auditorium was part of the original package. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2691.34s">And</a> it was at the behest of the then Medford City Council <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2694.398s">that</a> the separation took place, because if it didn't take place, we wouldn't even be talking about this today. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2699.461s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2700.402s">This</a> is the second time, I would say, in the last six months, I think it was Councilor Caraviello who brought up the resolution some six months ago or thereabouts, when there was a private film developer here in Medford Square, and they were putting up a marquee on top of the Chevalier Theater, and that drew so much attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2716.052s">People</a> thought that they were getting a marquee and shows were going to be coming to town. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2719.274s">It</a> was a great idea, and unfortunately, it didn't go anywhere because it wasn't <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2724.962s">It</a> wasn't the auditorium's idea to put the marquee up. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2727.784s">It</a> was the private entrepreneur from Hollywood to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2730.807s">But</a> it's a showing that if you had something like that, people would know what's coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2735.69s">Now,</a> as far as the great debate goes, it was well advertised. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2738.412s">The</a> chamber should be very proud of what they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2740.894s">I</a> am very proud of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2742.295s">And</a> more importantly, I just think it goes to show that if you bring something into that theater, people will come. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2748.78s">Now,</a> once you got into the theater, I think you saw something different. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2751.381s">I</a> think what you saw was a very old building <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2754.203s">that</a> probably needs some rehabilitation, but you don't want to take the character away from the building that's contained inside of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2761.124s">I</a> believe they did a great job in the lobby and the bathrooms coming in, and that took some money. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2765.365s">Again,</a> all volunteer work. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2766.666s">It's</a> been all volunteer work since the separation took place from Old Mifflin High School and Cheviot became independent. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2772.947s">The</a> unfortunate part about it, I just don't think it's ever been looked upon by city government the same way it's looked at now it is today, because you know it's a viable asset here for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2784.247s">It</a> can make money for the theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2785.668s">It</a> can also definitely make money here for the folks here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2790.35s">The</a> part about it, I think it was Councilor Marks alluded to the fact that it's not air-conditioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2794.372s">And</a> as you know, when you go to the Boston theaters, they are air-conditioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2797.814s">And</a> in the heat of the summer, you're just not going to get the type of a show that you think you would like to get because you're not Boston, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2804.677s">The</a> drawer is not the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2806.228s">The</a> amenities around the theater probably are not the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2810.311s">But</a> this theater is one of the catalysts that's going to make this square come back and come alive. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2816.755s">This</a> is what the new administration is going to want to deal with, because it's going to be good for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2822.299s">And</a> it's going to show that arts, culture, and history can be incorporated into your everyday commercial life. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2828.604s">It</a> can be incorporated into your business district. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2830.885s">And</a> it definitely can be communicated and worked into <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2833.92s">your</a> everyday nightlife that the City of Medford is working on very slowly. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2838.884s">It</a> was quite obvious that on that particular night, we had folks there from Somerville SCAT TV. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2844.429s">And</a> the only problem that I would probably say that presented itself that night, that should have been the City of Medford's cable access telecasting that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2852.356s">We're</a> going on the 21st year of the third year of a 10-year contract with Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2858.072s">And</a> because we're going on this third year, and because we just renewed, the city, excuse me, the city just renewed its contract, I believe it was May 7th, the public hearing took place, and I was the only one here for the city because I believe that Shavia, as well as other parts of this city, should have been included into the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2873.975s">And</a> if Shavia was wired properly, we wouldn't be talking about this for the next 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2879.876s">So</a> I think what the commission's gonna have to deal with, and it's gonna be a very tough deal, is no matter what they wanna produce there, and what they wanna show, and how they wanna get it out, <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2887.957s">It's</a> going to be costly, and they're going to have to go out of town because, again, Comcast is not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2893.6s">Maybe</a> we can do something about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2895.321s">Maybe</a> we can revisit that whole issue of how we're getting it rewired for whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2899.343s">But</a> right now, it doesn't stand that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2901.724s">And</a> when you have folks there from the high school, which was Channel 15, and you had the government channel being there, the people were excited over the fact that not only did you have almost 1,000 people there, but people would be able to watch this live. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2914.771s">They'd</a> be able to see it subsequent to that on a later date. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2918.499s">I</a> can't say nothing more other than the fact that I believe it was a good night for everybody there, the contestants, the panelists, the folks that put the program together. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2927.502s">It</a> did exactly what it was supposed to do, make the people, let them know, A, there's an election, but more importantly, let them know that Chevalier Auditorium is a viable component here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2939.825s">So</a> rather than letting, have all these volunteers do the work, it's time that the city steps up to the plate. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2945.107s">The</a> city of Lynn, <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2946.392s">proposes</a> our office, I could be wrong, John, you can correct me. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2949.093s">I</a> think it's about $100,000 they started off their auditorium commission over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2954.475s">They</a> gave them the money to do a show. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2956.476s">You</a> go do the show, give us the money back, we'll give you the money for the next show. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2960.618s">And</a> slowly but surely, it was one of these little walking steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2963.699s">Not</a> running steps, walking steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2965.46s">And</a> that's what they did to get it going. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2967.261s">We</a> can do the same thing. <a

href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2971.342s">It</a> came alive. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2972.643s">Small</a> as it might be, it's alive, it's well, and it's running. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2976.233s">Medford</a> has the talent, they have the arts, they have the history, and they definitely have the culture to do this in. <a

Commission, and everyone who put that together that night, I think it was a great night for the city of Medford, and I thank you, and I'm very appreciative of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2994.196s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3546.059s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3546.519s">Bill</a> on that page, you want page number two, page number two. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3550.741s">That's</a> where your preferred route and your alternate routes are.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3555.342s">The</a> goal routes, which align themselves to be the alternative route, which look like they're way out of, <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3561.627s">the</a> general direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3562.888s">Why</a> is that? <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3563.988s">Why</a> would you not be able to do the preferred route?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3601.846s">But</a> if you were to choose that alternate route for whatever the reason might be, it looks like the way it is here would be much more costly.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3704.793s">On</a> that last point, on the project and the city will negotiate an agreement, you have mitigation in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3708.736s">Is</a> there going to be mitigation?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3724.549s">Before</a> the city council can direct it, how do we know where to go? <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3727.491s">In</a> other words, what would the mitigation be and for what?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7636.483s">I</a> don't want to receive it in place on file, because we asked two months ago for an updated financial <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7640.658s">uh,</a> accounting of just where are we right now between the Republic parking and all the citations that have been dismissed. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7646.381s">We</a> still haven't gotten it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7647.862s">So</a> I don't want to receive it, but I want to report back from the mayor.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_VQ37Ro1sDkM/2025-03-21_VQ37Ro1sDkM.html">Medford City Council - October 13, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=1593.078s">And</a> with all fairness, I'm going to disagree with my colleagues because the Traffic Commission has already made their decision, and the decision has been made and should be going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=1601.202s">The</a> responsibility is in the Chief Executive Office because he appoints those people to that commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=1605.404s">All</a> this council will be doing is delaying it with more time and kicking the ball around. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=1609.546s">You</a> deserve an answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=1611.207s">It's</a> been voted upon, and it's the city administration that should figure out when and how to put that thing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=1616.39s">It</a> shouldn't take a citizen to keep coming down here and presenting your concerns, public safety, <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=1621.505s">and</a> shouldn't have a lady come down here with her child at nighttime to present this argument or this issue all over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=1627.529s">So</a> I'm going to disagree with my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=1629.37s">And</a> I'm going to move that this matter be referred to the mayor for immediate action. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=1633.212s">And</a> the action should be absolutely immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=1636.734s">If</a> the board of the commission voted for it, and the city has to figure out how to fund it, well, let them figure out how to fund it. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=1642.758s">But</a> they voted for it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2250.728s">Point</a> of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2251.528s">Counsel</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2252.409s">You</a> know, when we talk about taking ownership, the ownership of the matter has already been taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2256.512s">It's</a> gone through a public meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2258.153s">It's</a> gone through the walking with the chief of police. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2260.658s">You</a> have residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2261.539s">They've</a> discussed this. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2262.28s">They've</a> talked about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2263.24s">They've</a> been before this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2264.441s">She's</a> given you a litany, time, dates, and places of what's taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2268.044s">It's</a> gone before the Traffic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2269.405s">They've</a> taken a vote, and it's gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2271.747s">It's</a> obvious that the city administration doesn't know what its departments are doing, what its boards and commissions are doing, because if he did, or she did, who's ever running that show over there, this wouldn't be a subject matter that's before us right now.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2285.417s">Do</a> you mind if I finish, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2288.281s">The</a> fact of the matter is this, you don't deserve to be here tonight because the problem should have been resolved, or you guys should have been spoken to and given a time, date, and a place. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2296.247s">This</a> is not a yesterday issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2298.149s">This</a> goes back for many, many months, if not years, as it relates to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2302.192s">Mrs.</a> Fritz and the folks that she lives with, they've spent hundreds of hours not only cleaning up the place, but trying to work with the city to make that particular spot workable, livable in that particular neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2315.793s">No,</a> I don't think this is anything that belongs in the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2318.934s">I</a> don't think, if I'm going to finish it, do you mind, Mr. President?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3494.036s">Mr.</a> President, I'd like to move to sever the motions. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3496.497s">And</a> the reason why I'd like to sever them is <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3498.748s">I</a> would like to take that for which has already been voted and approved upon by the Traffic Commission, which would be the curb cut, the paulets, and the sidewalks as a separate issue and vote that go to the mayor for an immediate response and resolve, an immediate response and resolve in a time that it's going to be resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3519.363s">And</a> all the other issues regarding the South Medford area that are ancillary to that, I've got no problem <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3524.973s">um,</a> supporting that and a subcommittee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3527.215s">But,</a> um, as far as anything else goes that, Oh, okay.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3534.26s">So</a> we have seven.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3827.361s">Louise,</a> real quick.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3831.184s">Starting</a> January 1st to December 31st, 2016, it's 2%.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3837.008s">And</a> January 1st to December 31st, 2017, it's 2%. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3839.629s">And</a> January 1st, 2018, it's 2.5%. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3844.313s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3846.374s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3847.154s">Now,</a> you said this was for the Department of Public Works and two employees, did you say, of the electrical department?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3871.29s">That's</a> a total of many employees altogether that this package encompasses.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3888.801s">And</a> is that the total complement of employees that we have or is that that's all that showed up for the vote on that day?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3899.21s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3905.696s">Move</a> approval.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3995.627s">Mr.</a> President? <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3997.048s">So,</a> Louise, what is the actual increase in cost with this pay raise? <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4006.395s">To</a> transfer all these monies over, what does that come to in an actual increase in cost for the year?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4035.015s">So</a> that's approximately $71,000 of thereabouts. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4037.777s">Now,</a> is that $71,000 in this year's budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4042.961s">Or</a> is that something that's going to have to be found to add the $71,000, because what you did <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4048.144s">Did</a> you transfer the money?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4078.157s">So</a> the negotiated salary portion that's in the budget was how much for the year total?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4087.165s">What</a> was voted upon by the council when they voted for the negotiated salaries?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4095.672s">But</a> this $43,000 would come from that account?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4100.316s">And</a> you don't know what the, could you just, you don't have to do it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4103.359s">Could</a> you just, <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4104.243s">Tell</a> us what the dollar amount is and what the balance is now that you've taken the $43,000 out. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4107.984s">Just</a> report back.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4158.638s">Yes,</a> vote is seven in the affirmative. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4160.58s">None</a> in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4162.841s">Motion</a> carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4164.402s">One</a> quick question before you leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4165.963s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4166.623s">The</a> bids came in. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4167.444s">When</a> are we going to have that ceiling fixed? <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4170.566s">Can</a> we answer the question, please?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4186.136s">And</a> how much did the bids come in for?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4209.73s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4418.404s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4419.385s">Councilor</a> Fenton, did you have something? <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4420.805s">Likewise.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4421.166s">Alan,</a> quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4422.386s">This</a> is your first time serving on the board?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4426.048s">The</a> only thing that it doesn't say in here, it says it expires on June 1st, 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4432.192s">Did</a> your last term expire on June 1st of this year?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4440.576s">Oh,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4442.283s">And</a> just for the purposes of edification, do you notify the board, the city or does the city notify you about for reappointments?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4455.654s">So</a> how did you get notified to be reappointed?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4460.258s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4460.519s">Through</a> an email.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4462.06s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4463.021s">Other</a> than that, I think you're doing a great job and the board's doing a good job as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4466.403s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=5248.128s">Madam</a> Vice President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=5346.746s">Also,</a> Mr. President, I believe we received inquiries from some citizens as it relates to cats in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=5355.168s">And</a> since we have a dog officer, is it possible that we can get a report back either from him or for the board of public health? <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=5361.47s">If</a> there are any type of audiences that reflect upon responsibility of cats, if in fact they leave their domestic homes and who they're, you know, the people out there to take care of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=5374.63s">And</a> also, could we get a report back on just where are we on the dog park? <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=5378.191s">Because</a> we really haven't heard anything as to where we're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=5382.393s">This</a> has just been months hanging around.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_sEpbONopS5E/2025-03-21_sEpbONopS5E.html">Medford City Council - October 6, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=488.731s">Um,</a> Mark, um, the act that was approved on December 8th, 1975, it's chapter seven 30 of, of the acts of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=496.941s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=497.563s">And</a> the first sentence reads that the city of method is hereby authorized to use for any municipal purpose, a certain parcel of land. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=504.465s">No,</a> it doesn't say a certain parcel of land says a certain parcel of parkland in said city bounded and described as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=510.487s">Yes,</a> sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=511.007s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=511.647s">And</a> it goes to the not only in the southerly and southwesterly and blah, blah, blah.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=515.768s">Um,</a> and the records from the state house as it relates to this, for which there was a full blown discussion, it reflected upon the fact that, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=523.648s">We're</a> looking at two particular parcels of land here. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=527.109s">One</a> is the park land where the beach is, and the other one is a playground area. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=530.229s">And</a> the playground area, which is separate and distinct, I believe at one point in time, the city received federal money for the purposes of upgrading it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=538.451s">But</a> subsequent to that, the city has, and the city's park department, I believe, retains control, ownership, and maintenance, and care for that piece of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=547.333s">Now,</a> I, too, had a discussion with house council, and I believe that they said, <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=554.817s">It</a> was their feeling and their understanding that at the time that this was passed in 1975, any municipal purpose would include for what we're talking about right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=565.065s">I've</a> got no problem and re-clarifying that, but it's been since 1975 till now and there's never been a problem.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=572.751s">It</a> became a problem this summer because somebody posed the question, but when you say it's authorized to you for use for any municipal purpose, the city of Medford is hereby authorized to use it for any municipal purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=584.503s">I</a> thought that was pretty clear back then.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=588.228s">Well,</a> I know for any municipal purpose, a certain parcel of parkland and said city bounded and described as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=593.656s">And</a> it gets you to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=594.458s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=594.838s">And</a> I know it says parkland, <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=596.954s">And</a> with the legislation that you're filing, reverts it back to municipal land.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=601.177s">And</a> by making that distinction from parkland to municipal land, I understand all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=606.32s">But</a> again, reviewing the, this was an in-depth discussion back in 1975. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=610.303s">Yes,</a> I know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=612.084s">Cause</a> I was a representative at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=613.725s">And</a> I co-sponsored that bill.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=620.25s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=621.851s">And</a> at that point in time, there was a huge discussion on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=625.485s">As</a> it related to, and I think one of the arguments and the issues we used back then was if in fact the city was receiving federal money, it had to be opened up to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=633.776s">And</a> I believe one of the arguments and then was by filing and having this piece of legislation and not taking future federal monies. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=641.591s">we</a> could use it for any municipal purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=643.432s">So</a> all we're doing is basically taking out our parkland and making it a municipal purpose for whatever the municipal purpose might be.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=689.931s">I</a> understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=690.791s">But</a> I think also, so people can understand that while it's good corrective action, <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=695.736s">It's</a> still going to be under the control of the city of Medford for Medford residents only. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=700.378s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=701.118s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=701.619s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=2549.413s">How</a> long have the tenants been sitting there as a tenant at will?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=2565.141s">And</a> what are the options on there for the tenancy to end? <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=2569.004s">Requirements</a> by the tenant as compared to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=2571.226s">What</a> are the requirements for this tenancy at will to not become operative any further?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=2577.651s">Not</a> become operative any further.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=2582.672s">If</a> the tenant wanted to leave, what did they have to do, being a tenant?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=2589.634s">And</a> what about the city?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=2604.838s">On</a> September 1st of 2011, each councilor received a huge packet <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=2612.878s">of</a> a master plan for the Brooks Estate, which was a compilation of not only the outside, the inside, the area going up to it, and some of these issues that are being discussed here tonight are addressed in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=2626.27s">I</a> don't remember any actual vote taken by this council not to approve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=2630.391s">I</a> just think it, I don't think it's come up for a final vote one way or the other.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=2635.673s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=2636.793s">No,</a> to approve the three and a half million dollars for the Brooks estates.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=2642.194s">I</a> don't remember any final vote by this council taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=2645.135s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=2645.515s">But</a> putting that aside, uh, my only other question would be, um, as it relates to, you know, each and every year for many, many years, <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=2652.358s">the</a> city of Medford entertained community block grant funds to give to the Brooks Estates. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=2656.822s">And</a> inclusive of those compensations, which a lot of the money has gone for rehabilitation, restoration of that, there were considerations as it related to some of the things that the councilors were talking here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=2668.174s">So</a> to some degree, I think the council management <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=2672.014s">administratively</a> is aware of some of these concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=2674.635s">Have</a> they been addressed? <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=2675.416s">It's</a> obvious that they're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=2677.056s">So,</a> um, I think it would be a wise move to meet with the board, especially and maybe have the council just refresh themselves and go through this book. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=2684.22s">I</a> know it's a lot of reading, but it does break down the entire reconstruction or new construction or the future, uh, uh, growth of, of the Brooks estates. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=2693.444s">Um,</a> it's just a shame that we have to get to this particular point. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=2696.826s">And,</a> um, <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=2698.161s">I</a> don't know if you want to call it the lesser of two evils, but this is what, if this is what it has to do to resolve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=2703.922s">But</a> I agree with councilor Longo, something has to be done before you move forward as it relates to the maintenance of the property and how it's going to be cared for because it is a city owned piece of property.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4114.567s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4114.787s">Miller,</a> can I ask you a question, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4123.065s">and</a> all this conversation that we had tonight, something very important was pointed out, and it's the ceiling over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4128.827s">And</a> we were told months ago that that was going to be fixed, and it's still being covered up. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4135.088s">So</a> this is a municipal public building where somebody almost got killed when it fell down. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4139.21s">When</a> is that ceiling going to be fixed?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4160.887s">And</a> how much will the cost be?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4164.59s">How</a> much is it?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4173.996s">Yes,</a> it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4174.296s">It</a> was mentioned earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4176.495s">And</a> because it was mentioned earlier about things that need to be corrected in this community, the city is gonna budget for this, I'm assuming. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4183.601s">Where</a> is that money gonna come from? <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4184.762s">That's</a> the last question.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4187.044s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4324.165s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4326.286s">When</a> did this vote take place? <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4328.086s">When</a> did these folks vote on this?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4334.268s">So</a> we're voting, we're taking a vote on a money matter that hasn't even been voted and accepted. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4339.609s">Correct?</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4348.072s">So</a> for the purposes, for the purposes of protocol, this has not been voted upon yet.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4370.255s">It</a> might be binding, but the members themselves have not voted on this.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4374.559s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4375.039s">So</a> I think, in all fairness, I think this should just lay on the table until they take their vote, and we can just vote on it next week to keep the protocol in order.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4439.853s">I'll</a> be making, make it perfectly clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4441.634s">Um,</a> number one, if we're asked to being voted upon something for which I'm assuming the folks that work down there, local 25, the union membership, and they haven't yet voted on it, it's just the management or, or, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4454.455s">It's</a> just a preliminary. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4456.036s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4456.656s">I</a> mean, if everything goes all right, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4458.658s">But</a> I mean, why would you vote on something before the membership even had an opportunity to vote it up or down? <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4463.881s">I</a> mean, so if you're going to do it, why wouldn't you just do it right? <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4466.403s">That's</a> what protocol does.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4473.913s">No,</a> it wouldn't be because every single union contract that's signed here in the city has always been signed after the membership has taken a vote to accept it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4482.0s">Tonight,</a> we're voting on something where they haven't even voted to accept it, but it's just in the works and they probably will. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4488.124s">Well,</a> probably will is not the same as having it in proper form.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4541.445s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4548.186s">No,</a> it didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4548.686s">It</a> passed 4-3. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4549.086s">It</a> passed 4-3. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4549.526s">4-3.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4549.606s">4-3.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4549.666s">4-3.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4549.706s">4-3.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4549.746s">4-3.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4549.826s">4-3.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4550.086s">4-3.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4550.146s">4-3.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4550.226s">4-3.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4550.306s">I</a> apologize.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5518.252s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5518.852s">Chair</a> recognizes Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5521.074s">I</a> think what's interesting about this when it first came up in 2001, I was the only council that supported not only support it, but support putting it on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5529.578s">Unfortunately,</a> the council at that time voted six to one not to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5533.561s">But</a> here we are to new day. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5534.862s">It's</a> a new day. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5535.382s">Done.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5535.915s">I</a> think the part that's been most concerning by people who have a question is, once this is voted upon, how is the committee formed? <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5546.561s">Who</a> makes up the committee and who makes the determination of what and how the percentage is going to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5552.565s">Because</a> that's the big cloud in the sky.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5654.451s">Okay,</a> this was the question that came off of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5658.912s">Is</a> it the mayor of the community who sets up the appointments and makes these appointments? <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5662.893s">Because</a> it doesn't say.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5680.297s">So</a> if you say that, and let's just say the community votes to accept the community preservation act.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5686.54s">Are</a> you saying from your understanding, it would be up to the city council to make this determination on who gets appointed?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5694.625s">So</a> it'd be up to the city council to write the ordinance.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5702.245s">public</a> and what's the time sequence after let's just say it's on the ballot this November 3rd and it gets approved what's the time sequence that this has to take place I would have to go to our technical assistance and I think you know if you could come back and give us that answer because that's a question that's out there number one and number two <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5720.767s">If</a> somebody is going to vote for the Community Preservation Act, and I believe it's touting around 1.5%, is that the one? <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5729.689s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5730.489s">But</a> they don't know where it's going, and they're not going to know until after they vote for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5736.17s">How</a> is the community getting the input of saying, this is where, that's why I'm voting for this on November 3rd, because this is where the money's going. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5744.252s">It's</a> almost like, <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5746.288s">show</a> me first, and then give me the money, and then I'll show you first after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5750.469s">And</a> that's the two questions that I can't answer, so maybe you can answer it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5805.817s">Now,</a> this is over a five year period of time because you own it for five years, the first five years, correct?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5811.041s">Now,</a> can you change each and every year, change a different subject to have that money go to? <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5816.765s">Let's</a> just say you want to do the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5817.986s">Are</a> you stuck with the library for five consecutive years?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5845.453s">So</a> on an annual basis, you can change the money during the course of that five years.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5869.489s">And</a> the last question, Mr. President, is if I understand reading <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5874.66s">the</a> synopsis of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5876.101s">If</a> a board or a commission doesn't exist, you can create a new board or commission to put this money. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5882.527s">And</a> secondly, it uses the term housing authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5885.37s">And</a> since this council has no authority over the Medford Housing Authority, that was a question that's been presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5890.955s">So</a> where do we go with that one?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5959.534s">And</a> if, in fact, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts cannot meet its obligation financially, and I think as we had this discussion before, I think what's been appropriated so far for this year is an 18% money back to the cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5974.819s">If</a> the city of Medford for the next five years, let's just say, once the committee's all formed and you set up some parameters and some programs, can one year, let's just say, be for the library? <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5985.402s">Can</a> one year could be for maintenance for the schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5988.87s">For</a> the next five years while we own this CPA, can each and every year have a different designation for those monies to go to?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=6022.868s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=8549.839s">The</a> question I want to ask Councilor Knight is, are you suggesting by doing this, you might want to retire, future? <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=8559.898s">condo</a> conversions, to keep them as residentials?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=8602.845s">But</a> what is the question? <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=8603.745s">You</a> have a concern that there are too many conversions taking place?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=8650.179s">I</a> hear what you're saying as far as that part goes, but I don't read this is what your audience is trying to get to, because I'm getting the opinion here that you'll either want to slow down or stop, and you would be stopping a free enterprise system from doing what it wants. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=8662.344s">I</a> mean, how can you tell somebody, if you're allowed to have your house converted into condominiums, that you can't? <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=8668.407s">Because</a> if this new ordinance comes into place, because quote, unquote, as you say, you're limiting or you're delimiting the amount of available rental space.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=8695.358s">Well,</a> I think the question I like to put an amendment to the paper, Mr. Clark, that the city, Mr. Clark, Mr. Clark. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=8705.003s">that</a> the city solicitor report back as to whether the city of Medford can legally, legally enforce, legally enforce reducing the amount of condo conversions. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=8719.252s">I</a> don't think that that's what this resolution has to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=8721.154s">You</a> just talked about condominium conversions. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=8723.155s">Read</a> the paper that's in front of you, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=8724.316s">I</a> am reading it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=8730.581s">And</a> I'm asking you, you think there are too many conversions taking place?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=8749.194s">Well,</a> I want a legal question asked in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=8750.955s">Can</a> the city of Medford enact any kind of an ordinance that limits condo conversions? <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=8758.057s">Because</a> that's part of the regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=8759.518s">Can</a> you limit them or not? <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=8760.518s">Yes</a> or no?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=8769.833s">It's</a> a lot of work to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=8771.754s">It's</a> part of a city solicitor's request.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=8969.724s">That's</a> all well and good. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=8970.604s">But</a> before you get to that, the question needs to be answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=8972.705s">Can</a> the city legally regulate multiple family homes to be converted into condos? <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=8976.787s">And</a> if the, I'd like to have that question asked to the city solicitor, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=8985.571s">I</a> think it would make sense because if the answer is no, <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=8990.328s">Yes,</a> it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=8990.789s">Because</a> if the answer is no, where are you going with this? <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=8994.052s">You're</a> going nowhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=8994.873s">Because</a> if the city cannot regulate this legally, then what discussions are you going to have?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9016.082s">And</a> maybe he can say yes and let him explain to us yes, or if he says no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9019.724s">I</a> mean, to me, legally, I would like to know where I'm going with this before I spend a tremendous amount of time having all these people come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9026.669s">Or</a> there may be guidelines to say, if you want to limit it, this is the way you can go legally. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9030.612s">We</a> don't know, legally, yes or no. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9033.032s">So</a> we can incorporate this as part of this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9036.514s">I</a> mean, what's the problem?<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_JN0LvnDt6wc/2025-03-21_JN0LvnDt6wc.html">Medford City Council - September 29, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=487.855s">Quick</a> question. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=488.596s">Is</a> this just because the husband died and it's a change in name? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=491.117s">Is</a> this what we're doing?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=509.71s">Is</a> the petitioner present?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=516.372s">Well,</a> I don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=517.532s">Why</a> did it have to go to the Board of Appeals?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=565.767s">Mr.</a> President, can we get a copy of that law, that requirement that says that they had to go to the board of appeals? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=572.654s">I</a> don't remember ever seeing that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=576.636s">No,</a> I know, but I'd like to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=578.337s">So</a> for the future, we know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=586.722s">But</a> if that's a Zoning Board decision?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=592.925s">When</a> was the public hearing on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=594.286s">June</a> 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=595.047s">Of</a> this past year? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=595.907s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=596.447s">For</a> this? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=597.268s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=598.527s">To</a> the change, Kano to go, not this.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=616.106s">So</a> the Mass State Lottery Commission approved it? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=618.068s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=618.604s">and</a> then it had to come back to the city, and then it had to go to the Board of Appeals, because apparently that's not in our zoning ordinance, is that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=625.109s">Is</a> that in our zoning ordinance now and been advertised? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=628.511s">Is</a> that now in our zoning ordinance that's been advertised? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=631.714s">I</a> don't remember seeing that come before the council for an advertisement.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=652.16s">I</a> understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=652.74s">I</a> want to make sure that I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=654.341s">Rick,</a> are you saying that subsequent to us tabling this, they had to take that back to the Mass State Lottery? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=660.344s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=660.864s">And</a> they approved it? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=661.865s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=662.265s">And</a> then it came back here to the Board of Appeals in June, you said?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=669.028s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=669.529s">Can</a> we get copies of that, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=670.969s">Yes,</a> it's in our packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=672.509s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=2437.763s">If</a> I understand the liquor law, correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=2439.545s">If</a> your last calls at 11 o'clock, they cannot stay there no longer than 15 minutes after the last call. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=2446.93s">And</a> then the drinks have to be returned. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=2448.931s">They</a> cannot drink anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=2450.593s">Correct</a> me if I'm wrong, but if you have a one o'clock food license for extended hours, you can stay there providing your reading, but not drinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=2456.75s">That's</a> the difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=2459.171s">The</a> liquor license prohibits you for whatever that time period is, 15 minutes after, if the license is 11 o'clock, 11.15, that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=2466.853s">That's</a> the max you can stay there.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=2488.371s">I</a> was just explaining the liquor law. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=2489.933s">That's</a> all I was explaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=2491.294s">That</a> has a license that ends at 11 o'clock period.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6167.434s">I</a> would assume that the reason why we're here tonight is for the extended hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6172.258s">And</a> unfortunately, these extended hours have led into a neighborhood concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6176.701s">So</a> I guess my first question would be to the two gentlemen who own the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6182.365s">Can</a> you come up here, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6183.406s">I'd</a> like to ask you a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6189.91s">And</a> I didn't get your names from the beginning, so I know you're...
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6200.42s">Well,</a> business owners.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6204.78s">Did</a> you folks have an attorney representing you?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6208.681s">You</a> have no attorney? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6210.161s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6210.301s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6211.442s">I</a> think that's one of the problems that they're having here right now because of the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6215.622s">There</a> have been situations in the past where if you had the right attorney, or if you had an attorney, let's put it that way, that recognized that this might consider to be a problem within the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6225.262s">or</a> could present a problem with the neighborhood, they would notify, they would be talking with you, and they would have neighborhood meetings before, or maybe even subsequent to a meeting such as this, where you would be able to sit down with the neighborhood to find out really what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6238.953s">And</a> we had a situation like that most recently on Riverside Avenue on a building establishment of three businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6244.357s">And</a> I think that's maybe one of the real big drawbacks that are happening here right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6248.06s">As</a> far as the business itself going forward, <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6252.585s">You</a> advertise for sports bar, karaoke, and a weekend DJ. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6256.886s">That's</a> noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6259.227s">And</a> the neighborhood is not used to maybe that type of noise, because they've never had it or seen it before. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6265.489s">But</a> unfortunately, you advertise something that you probably shouldn't have advertised. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6270.09s">And</a> that was a no-no, in plain English. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6272.61s">So</a> I think we know that as far as mistake, and you're not going to go forward with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6276.031s">I</a> like the idea of the folks sitting down together. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6278.975s">And</a> it might work itself out even better that whatever the compromise might be that you folks can come to, that you realize that if the business is going to expand, and it's going to expand the working base here in this community, unfortunately, if it abuts a neighborhood, something's got to give one way or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6298.068s">Now,</a> the gentleman who came here before and said, you could go to Carol's Diner at 1 o'clock in the morning and get something to eat, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6304.053s">But</a> you were opposite a police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6305.474s">If</a> anything took place, a police station was right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6308.064s">You're</a> not next to a police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6309.705s">Unfortunately,</a> you've heard all the comments relative to what's going on in the neighborhood, whether it's drugs, crime, or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6315.689s">Not</a> emanating from your place, but that's what's in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6318.53s">And</a> so I think what you've done is you've highlighted a pretty good issue right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6321.592s">And</a> the issue is that the entire neighborhood now comes under the microscope. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6325.895s">And</a> it's unfortunate that it's your business, but maybe it's the best thing that now could happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6330.598s">So</a> I wish you good luck, because you've spent a lot of time, effort, and energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6335.421s">But</a> the neighborhood has a stake in this, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6337.626s">the</a> immediate butters, because this is going to be all new to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6340.849s">So,</a> I support the idea that you all sit down, try to come to some compromise to understand exactly what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6346.393s">When</a> you say, weekend DJ, I mean, is that Friday, Saturday, and Sunday? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6350.737s">You're</a> going to have a DJ there playing music? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6352.458s">People</a> are going to be dancing? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6353.679s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6354.46s">That</a> belongs before the liquor commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6356.221s">But</a> these are the questions that nobody seems to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6358.963s">Karaoke,</a> you're going to have that on three nights a week where people are going to go up there and sing, have a good time, and laugh? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6363.988s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6364.879s">You</a> have a noise factor, and that's something I think you're probably going to have to explain when you go before the liquor bar. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6369.903s">As</a> far as the sports bar goes, I mean, you can go to any restaurant, I think, in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6373.206s">They</a> all have televisions in there right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6375.708s">So,</a> and the other gentleman who says you have these liquor people come in there and they give you — yeah, they're going to do that no matter what the bar is. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6383.414s">So,</a> I'm more concerned about having you come to a happy medium. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6387.357s">I</a> like the idea that you've spent a lot of money and you've invested it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6389.919s">So,</a> that means you believe in the city, you believe in the neighborhood, and you believe in your business. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6394.11s">and</a> it's nice to hear people come here to support you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6396.311s">And</a> I didn't hear anyone from the neighborhood oppose you because of your business. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6400.433s">They're</a> just concerned about how is this going to affect them. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6403.634s">So</a> I agree with Councilor Marks and Councilor Longo-Curran and Councilor Caraviello, not only having maybe a review, but maybe to just go down and sit down and let them have a better understanding of really what this is. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6415.459s">It's</a> unfortunate that this 300 radius didn't do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6419.201s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6419.661s">Did</a> it do the circumference or not? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6420.982s">Maybe</a> it did, maybe it didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6422.062s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6424.1s">If</a> everybody's on the same page, I don't think the council will have an objection, but I just think it's good that they understand this, as it relates to that, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6431.743s">So,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6433.184s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6465.91s">Entertainment</a> for what, though?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6469.971s">Weekend</a> DJ, karaoke?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6544.867s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6826.064s">Mr.</a> President, I would like to <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6828.796s">amendment</a> attached to my amendment that I offered some months ago when I brought forward the idea of not only offering a tax abatement, but for the incentive to bring new business folks in here, hiring Medford people and giving tax breaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6841.987s">I</a> think I gave you folks all an example of what took place in a particular city down in Florida, where they took a particular area in a downtown area and they took a street, business by business by business. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6852.996s">And</a> what they did is they went there and they made an offering as it relates to <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6856.238s">What</a> the city would like to see down here, you tell us what you would do as a business owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6862.76s">Because</a> of that, you would get a tax break, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6865.521s">You</a> would hire local people, number two. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6867.522s">And</a> you would get a long-term lease with the landowner on that so the abatements wouldn't keep on going. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6874.084s">Resulting</a> from that, it just continued to take off. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6876.665s">It</a> took a long period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6878.385s">The</a> city of Lowell just got through doing something like that, and I think they just completed their seventh year of a program like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6884.358s">as</a> it relates to taking downtown business districts as it relates to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6889.302s">Earlier</a> this evening, we heard about the fact that we don't have method people want to come here because we're not a business friendly community or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6897.749s">The</a> unfortunate part is we only have one, one and a half people working in our office of community development. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6902.954s">I'm</a> offering an office of business and cultural affairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6906.448s">which</a> will bring about an outreach for business, it'll bring out the history, it'll bring about an inclusionary of all the items within neighborhoods that are necessary to make business and development grow here within our city of Medford, because each and every business district is different, and each and every business district abuts different residential neighborhoods or other types of businesses, and they too need to be addressed separately and independently. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6932.468s">So,</a> uh, the offering here by Councilor Knight, um, I don't know if it's because you were reading my mind or you read my mind before I, uh, you're reading my resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6941.813s">Uh,</a> I appreciate the fact that you're looking at this, but, um, I can assure you of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6945.975s">Once</a> I'm January comes, this will be one of the priority things that I will do as mayor of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6951.649s">I</a> will take this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6952.149s">Oh,</a> I'm not campaigning.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6969.458s">Yeah,</a> I would like to attach that to my resolution that I had tried to attach your resolution to counsel nights.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6987.159s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6988.199s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6988.84s">It's</a> in the same position that judges. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6991.822s">Oh,</a> I think it was like maybe in February, March of this year, we're going to ask for an update on Councilor Penta's resolution as well.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8429.94s">There</a> we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8431.281s">The</a> messenger saved us. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8433.121s">Let's</a> try this again. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8434.502s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8435.402s">What</a> I'd like to say that Tony Bova deserves the award. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8438.303s">Uh,</a> we also know besides him being involved in hockey, he was actively involved, um, in men's softball. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8444.886s">He</a> was actively involved in keeping people, um, competitive in sports, no matter what the age group was or is. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8452.328s">And,</a> um, and that's a true staple to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8455.143s">But</a> having you folks come up here and through Councilor Caraviello wanting to give him this award, I think it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8460.786s">I</a> like to call him Mr. Sports because he is actively involved in so many things within this community that involves parents as well as kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8468.629s">It's</a> deserving. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8469.41s">He's</a> a very humble guy and I hope he's, I know he's going to be appreciative of this when he comes up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8476.733s">The</a> one thing that Councilor Caraviello indicated that you would hope he would get the award <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8481.473s">before</a> this mayor leaves office. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8483.895s">There's</a> a host of other issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8486.096s">There's</a> other people, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8489.238s">There</a> are other. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8492.48s">I</a> understand that, but you said you hoped he would come up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8495.182s">There</a> are other resolutions that have been passed for people to get awards that are in queue, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8500.766s">So</a> I would hope maybe this is the genesis to push all the other folks who are waiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8506.19s">And</a> so with that being said, I thank you for being here and being supportive of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8511.463s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8512.484s">Thank</a> you, Councilor.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9033.404s">Go</a> ahead, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9034.224s">The</a> citizen wants to speak first. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9036.346s">Did</a> you want to speak on this, sir?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9290.138s">This</a> is a nonpartisan election. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9292.86s">Where</a> in the law does it say that in a municipal nonpartisan election? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9298.184s">Are</a> all 16 of these machines going to be tested, Eddie?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9305.989s">All</a> 16?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9344.326s">Well,</a> can you notify the candidates as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9347.209s">I'm</a> publicly asking you, can you notify the candidates as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9351.173s">Will</a> you?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9389.064s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9509.427s">When</a> you say they're not—when are those ballots actually opened and tallied, the absentee ballots?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9520.453s">So</a> you don't wait until the end of the day and open them up? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9524.855s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9524.995s">So</a> if you have 10 or 15 ballots come in at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, somebody opens them up and puts them in the machine, how are you going to know which ones are absentee? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9533.059s">Pardon</a> me? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9533.679s">How</a> do you know which ones are absentee if you're putting them in the count?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9555.9s">No,</a> no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9556.78s">Go</a> back to the second question. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9557.901s">If</a> the sheet comes off with a number, candidate A gets 100, candidate B gets 90, are you saying that the absentee ballots are included in that 190?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9571.231s">But</a> I thought they had until five o'clock of the day of the election to get the ballots in the absentee ballot to be effective.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9586.303s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9586.583s">So</a> if the mail is delivered at eight o'clock at night or seven or six o'clock, I could probably get a, uh,
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9601.679s">So</a> are you saying that once you post that thing on there, that paper posting out there at 805, that has all the absentee ballots to be counted?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9619.212s">So</a> let me get this straight. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9620.693s">All</a> absentee ballots are to be included in the 16 ballot boxes at 8.05 or whatever that time is when that white strip comes out and the totals are in.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9646.241s">So</a> then just explain, for the sake of clarification, <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9649.044s">In</a> this most recent primary, there was a couple of, what do you call the ballots that had to be reviewed? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9655.227s">Provisional?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9655.587s">Provisional,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9656.648s">Explain</a> that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9665.652s">So</a> what constitutes a provisional ballot?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9785.98s">For</a> someone to come and register to vote, you do not have to show identification. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9789.261s">Is</a> that true or false? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9790.241s">Pardon</a> me? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9791.582s">If</a> a brand new person was to walk into the city hall, <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9794.237s">to</a> go downstairs to register and vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9795.878s">Do</a> they have to show an ID or not?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9807.684s">But</a> what if they don't have one?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9814.047s">You</a> can't vote?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9820.13s">So</a> you're saying that every person that registers to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9823.127s">has</a> to have a Social Security number.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9826.729s">Pardon</a> me?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9831.411s">Not</a> the card, just the identification. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9832.992s">So</a> anybody could just 1, 2, 3, 4, and you've got to write it down? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9836.334s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9842.877s">So</a> that's the only way to verify if somebody is a legitimate, if somebody can vote? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9849.353s">I</a> said, that's the only way somebody can verify if they're eligible to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9854.037s">No</a> picture ID, no nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9855.698s">Just</a> walk in there and give them four numbers that supposedly are your last four numbers on Social Security.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9876.627s">We</a> can also create the link if they were a voter another community, you know So what you're gonna do is you'll notify the council and everyone that the date that you can have these machines tested The dates you can have these machines tested you will notify us as a council Yeah, okay <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9904.889s">And</a> all 16 will be tested, correct?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9912.574s">You</a> don't do them all in the same day?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9927.223s">Do</a> you have any backup machines, just in case one of them doesn't work?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9934.896s">So</a> if one of the machines doesn't test out, what do you do?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10007.091s">No,</a> he wants the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10007.851s">Give</a> it to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10008.572s">No,</a> no.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=11524.304s">If</a> you look up in the ceiling over there, when is it ever going to get fixed? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=11527.466s">It's</a> over two years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=11528.546s">Over</a> two years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=11529.406s">It's</a> over two years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=11530.047s">We've</a> all watched people almost die. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=11531.667s">Right.</a> <h2><a href="../2025-03-21_Q7cD9OP2TNA/2025-03-21_Q7cD9OP2TNA.html">Medford City Council - September 22, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=681.0s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=682.122s">The</a> unfortunate part about talking about this here tonight, there is really no need to talk about it because we have about $7.5 million in our water and sewer surplus enterprise account. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=693.085s">That's</a> what the money is used for, whether it's this program here that's $25,000 or the program that was originally offered at approximately $100,000 would have identified, as Council Member Marx just alluded to, every single house on a particular day, a particular night, a particular time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=708.777s">the</a> individual person who was having that water loss would be identified. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=712.62s">Now,</a> unfortunately, we have these new water meters, as we all know, for those of you that live in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=717.383s">And</a> if you're renters and rate payers, you'll understand that when they say that they have a policy not to give any abatements to someone who has a leak, that just doesn't sound right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=729.051s">Because</a> why should they not give an abatement to someone who's having a leak through no fault of their own? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=734.515s">But</a> is it through no fault of their own? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=735.775s">It's</a> probably the city's fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=736.916s">They</a> knew this was happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=738.535s">They</a> saw it coming, and they didn't do anything about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=741.496s">I</a> went to two meetings this past spring with the Water and Soil Commission to address this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=746.737s">But</a> it has to have the support of the administration to spend this money to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=750.698s">And</a> again, I thank my council colleague, Councilor Alango-Curran, for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=755.7s">And</a> hopefully the council votes seven to nothing for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=758.34s">But</a> it's the city administration that has to grant this issue of going forward to have this detection program in sight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=764.882s">So</a> hopefully all of you who voted for it and supported <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=768.878s">It</a> also is a beneficial asset to not only this community, but just saving water, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=774.5s">Whether</a> it's 20% or whatever the amount is that's unaccounted for, you're paying for it one way or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=779.302s">And</a> it's not coming out of every single home. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=781.003s">It's</a> not even coming out of the homes that have these leaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=783.884s">And</a> the city in and of itself has its own leak problem beside the water that the city uses for its particular purposes for which you, the taxpayer, are being charged. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=792.668s">So</a> I would like to have, just to bump this up one more degree, and not only support it, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=798.627s">But</a> have a meeting, call for a meeting, Mr. President, with the Board of Water and Soil Commissioners for the purposes of going forward with this and any other proposal that might be necessary to finally resolve this problem once and for all.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1354.64s">It's</a> a necktie <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1355.586s">I</a> don't think we need that for what you're asking, because we've been asking for a monthly report that would include that for what you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1362.608s">We've</a> only got one monthly report so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1365.788s">So</a> if you don't mind, can we just up it to say we'd like to have an up-to-date report on everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1370.45s">Tickets,</a> citations, amount received, appeals pending, tickets that have been waived, and tickets that have been given up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1377.751s">Because</a> that's what basically the report gave us before. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1381.04s">So</a> rather than extrapolate it out of one or two issues, why don't we just ask for the complete report that we should be getting that we've asked for?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2112.143s">This</a> is the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2113.143s">This</a> isn't Arlington, Belmont, Winchester, or any other town. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2115.725s">This</a> is the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2117.326s">And</a> I want to go back to February 3rd of this past year, February 3rd of 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2120.508s">Councilor</a> Marks asked a very important question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2124.937s">Because</a> one of the problems that we were having over here was that people would get out of their car, go to the kiosk, put their money in, and by the time they came back, they were getting a ticket because these bounty hunters were there ready to land on you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2137.784s">Well,</a> this past weekend, I observed two particular situations in the far end parking lot here in Nutford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2143.927s">And</a> they were both two, one a woman with a child, another one was an elderly lady. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2148.69s">Both</a> of them were coming out of wherever they were, respectively. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2151.511s">They</a> had their tickets in their hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2152.792s">They</a> were walking toward their cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2154.702s">Those</a> trucks were waiting right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2156.543s">One</a> woman was within one minute of having that thing expired or she would have got a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2161.386s">And</a> the other woman was two minutes, one minute and two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2164.508s">And</a> they were right there, ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2167.07s">Council</a> Marks asked the traffic commission to give a 15 minute leeway before and after for someone who would park their car, just as just one of the issues to park their car to go to and from. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2179.177s">Now,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2179.798s">It</a> doesn't make any sense at all, because these folks are out of town. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2182.58s">They</a> don't even come from the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2183.961s">They</a> don't even come from Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2185.762s">They're</a> only here for one thing, is to make money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2188.544s">And</a> to me, it's anti-business, and it's anti-consumer for the citizens of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2192.927s">People</a> keep saying, other cities and towns do this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2196.51s">It's</a> good to look and see what other cities and towns do, because you can probably land. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2200.633s">But</a> Medford has to be unique unto itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2202.834s">It</a> has to be its own person, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2205.776s">And</a> if we've had it this way for a long period of time, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2208.593s">Maybe</a> what we really need to do is to go back and look at the 2009 report for which this mayor commissioned and asked them to report back and for which this mayor did not heed their advice, which was very simple, to have a traffic enforcement plan with proper signage and enforcement and see where that took you on a very small scale, slowly but surely. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2229.17s">We</a> went from A to Z overnight just like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2231.772s">And</a> of course, it's in the dead of winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2234.033s">But</a> forget the winter because it's come and gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2236.245s">You've</a> had all your summer months, and now you're getting into the early fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2240.028s">It</a> just isn't getting better. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2241.41s">They're</a> just pounding away these people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2243.652s">And</a> when you think of a business such as this that makes tremendous, they're making hundreds of thousands of dollars, and they operate from 8 in the morning to 6 o'clock at night, and they're not open on Saturday, which is a legitimate business day in the business world of today. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2257.384s">And</a> the folks in this community that have to have an appeal <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2259.799s">As</a> Councilor Lungo just alluded to, they can't even go, because if they're working from Monday through Friday, their appeal process should be able to be taken care of on a Saturday, at least within a month's period of time at maximum. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2271.563s">You</a> do have options. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2272.703s">Your</a> options can be a buyout. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2274.284s">Your</a> options can be to change it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2276.004s">But</a> you can't even consider the idea of tweaking it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2279.005s">Some</a> people want to say, well, we're going to give it out to all our seniors for nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2283.007s">Now,</a> if I was Republican and I was looking at that comment, I'd say, wait a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2286.718s">It's</a> bad enough you took my 7 to 7 away, you now brought me down 8 to 6. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2290.481s">That's</a> 12 hours a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2292.203s">That's</a> 48 hours a month you're taking away from me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2294.445s">That's</a> profit in my pocket. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2296.026s">That's</a> not what the contract says. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2297.947s">And</a> even though the city solicitor says that the city of Medford has the right to change the time, and they also have the right to change the rates, I don't think that would fly in the contract because if you read the contract, it's quite specific as it relates to what you can and cannot do.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2399.935s">What</a> we're talking about here is a system that's broken. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2403.277s">It</a> doesn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2404.918s">We're</a> talking about a system that has caused so much anxiety to business folks and to consumers and to our own residents here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2412.802s">And</a> the fact of the matter is there was no public meetings on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2416.243s">There</a> was no public hearings on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2418.404s">Last</a> year in October, the city of Medford city council asked on three separate times through resolutions to have these types of meeting with the downtown business areas and to have the chamber included and to have the residents included. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2429.747s">And</a> the mayor ignored all of those requests, only to sign the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2434.009s">And</a> what you have is what you've got right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2436.15s">A</a> complete debacle of an operation that has absolutely and serves no purpose here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2444.554s">Just</a> think about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2445.194s">I'll</a> leave you with this last thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2446.815s">We're</a> all talking about the problems, and we're going to sit down and have another meeting, another meeting, and another meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2451.697s">This</a> has been going on for well over a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2453.839s">And</a> because there was no transparency to this whole operation, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2457.223s">And</a> because there was no communication back and forth, and because there was no thought process as it relates to what possibly could happen, what can't we do, what should we do, that in and of itself has got to tell you, you can't keep talking about changing a program knowing it doesn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2473.886s">If</a> it doesn't work, you do one of two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2476.566s">You</a> get rid of it, and you start all over again, slowly but surely you have a sense of transparency, and that's the way it should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2483.107s">So</a> the people of this community who are paying for it understand what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2488.29s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2634.115s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Pantone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2636.035s">That</a> is absolutely not true, Mr. President, because the total cost of the program to put this in operation was less than a million dollars, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2642.717s">Number</a> two, they've already taken over $440,000 in net profit from the last report that we got, and the city of Mifflin only got 32%. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2649.439s">So</a> if they got $442,000, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2652.197s">We</a> got less than $200,000 out of that so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2655.418s">There</a> are trade-offs in this particular contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2657.839s">There</a> have been violations in this contract by both sides, by Republic as well as the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2663.001s">And</a> the City of Medford has been equally negligent in not going forward either through the traffic commission or through resolutions of this council as it relates to the agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2671.584s">And</a> lastly, and most importantly, all this Medford City Council ever did was to allow the mayor to go out and to negotiate with Republic <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2678.913s">up</a> to a 10-year contract, but at the same time to come back to the council and show us if the city of Medford was going to do it and what the cost factor would be before anything was done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2689.423s">The</a> mayor never did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2690.384s">He</a> went ahead and signed the contract <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2691.968s">without</a> coming back to the Medford City Council and explaining both in detail.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2766.825s">point</a> of information, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2769.326s">May</a> 20th of 2014, Council Resolution 14472 offered by, before the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2774.888s">Yes,</a> the Medford City Council did agree to allow the Mayor to go forward, but also conditioned upon the fact that he would present himself back, present himself back with an in-house review as to what the cost would be on September 10th of 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2789.614s">We</a> had a Committee of the Whole meeting over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2791.685s">And</a> the reason why the Committee of the Whole meeting took place was, again, to explain that for which took place between May 20th up to September 14th, September 10th. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2800.768s">At</a> that meeting, there was 30 to 40 business people at that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2804.149s">And</a> there was a pushback by the mayor because he didn't expect those people to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2808.271s">On</a> October 10th, approximately one month later, the mayor came back and signed the contract without getting a vote of approval by the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2817.094s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2817.514s">Those</a> are the records of this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2818.894s">Mr.</a> Chair.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3828.366s">Mr.</a> President, this resolution is brought forward because, as we all know, as you traverse through Medford Square and as of some point in time during this late summer, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3838.523s">We've</a> seen construction taking place here in Renfrew Square as it relates to the Craddock Bridge or the refurbishing of the Craddock Bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3846.205s">Now,</a> we know it's a 121-foot bridge, and we know that we've been told it's going to take approximately two and a half years to get itself refurbished. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3853.406s">The</a> unfortunate part of the two and a half years is that this is not an everyday, six-day-a-week project. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3858.547s">In</a> any one given week, you may be working two days, three days, four days, for whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3863.668s">And</a> unfortunately, in the contract, there's nothing that demands that they have to be there on a daily basis <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3868.536s">six</a> days a week, working double time, as the contract said it would. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3872.297s">Number</a> two, we see there is an ongoing traffic congestion and a traffic public safety problem with the buses that are now stopping on Main Street in downtown Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3883.761s">And</a> since, in fact, there has to be some changes, because the sidewalks are going to be getting dug up, the street is going to have to be refurbished over there on the odd side of the street, something has to give. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3895.724s">And</a> what's going to have to give is the public buses, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3898.699s">that</a> traverse over there because there is no way that they can make a reasonable public safety stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3904.243s">My</a> recommendation would be, since the city council is the only one that can move to change or recommend to change bus stops, is to put those buses all on Medford Square that would stop there, change the direction of River Street instead of coming down and have it go left so it takes you right back to Salem Street and then it goes around. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3921.548s">I've</a> spoken with many senior citizens from 121 and 99. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3924.849s">There</a> is no way that they want to walk down that new ring road, cross under the bridge, to go to the bus stop if it's going to be moved over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3932.69s">That</a> walk, especially in the winter, especially if the inclement weather, snow or raining, it would just put them right out of business, physically, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3941.652s">So</a> by putting those buses in Main Street, instead of coming and taking the ride on Main Street like they do, all they would do would be just going into Medford Square, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3949.827s">They</a> would be going to River Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3951.308s">You'd</a> be opening up the parking spaces on the right-hand side, on the Dainty Donut side, and you would just probably add maybe another three to four minutes on a bus route, but so be it, because something's going to have to give. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3963.377s">So</a> to make sure that everybody's on board with this so there's an understanding, Mr. President, I'm going to recommend that we have a committee of the whole so we have a sense of transparency and openness as it relates to not only this particular issue, to let's look at all the ideas that need to be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3976.898s">That</a> would be my recommendation right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3978.499s">And</a> that's what's speaking from business owners and from people who traverse those bus stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3982.382s">But</a> again, this needs to be done sooner than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3984.503s">So</a> I'm going to ask you, Mr. President, within the next two weeks to call for a Committee of the Whole meeting and to also call someone from the Department of Transportation, also someone from the MBTA, as well as our own Office of Community Development. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3996.651s">And</a> I welcome that, and it's important.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4013.714s">I</a> think we're either the third or the fourth highest user within its system. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4017.857s">And</a> this is one time, if you remember correctly, because I do, because I have my notes, the last time we had this meeting, there was one lady who allegedly stated that she was the only one that was in charge of reviewing these bus stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4028.286s">They</a> don't make the decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4029.787s">The</a> Medford City Council makes the decision on bus stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4033.05s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4035.825s">without</a> being repetitious, and they won't be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4037.927s">And</a> the other sad part about this whole thing, it's already impacting businesses in the downtown Medford Square area. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4043.732s">Now,</a> we've been told that there was no mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4045.714s">Mitigation</a> is not an available item. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4047.275s">And</a> that's absolutely not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4049.076s">Because</a> if this bridge is going to eventually put people out of business or put people to the point of going into bankruptcy, then, you know, there is a need to have that whole thought process take place, even though it's a state contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4061.867s">The</a> state contract has subcontractors. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4063.939s">And</a> the subcontractors have to be held liable, just like they were on the FAST 14 when they did the bridges a few years ago, the 14 bridges, 14 weeks in a row, and they put them up over a weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4075.385s">So,</a> without going into that, and the other part I'd like to have, Mr. President, is have our city engineer report back to the council that since, in fact, they're building that portable bridge that's going to go over, they're pounding into the ground the structure to hold the <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4092.745s">the</a> bridge and the arch of the bridge going across. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4095.407s">What</a> impact, if anything, is that having on those buildings that abut not only the waterways, but the waterways in and of itself? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4103.612s">Don't</a> forget, that bridge has been there for well in excess of 100 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4106.474s">It's</a> built a solid granite, hasn't sunk an inch. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4109.516s">The</a> only thing that's sunk an inch is the downtown Medford Square area. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4113.058s">So</a> with that being said, building upon that granite, which the foundation is already there, yes, it's a cost savings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4118.85s">But</a> you've gone from $3 million up to almost $11.8 million to build a bridge that's 121 feet, and they're telling you it's taken two and a half years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4126.753s">So</a> if it's taken two and a half years to build it, and they're not building it each and every day, six days a week, double-shift days, then that's the reason why it's taken two and a half years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4136.518s">Because</a> these companies, subcontractors and major companies, basically are doing other jobs, and probably legitimately so. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4147.538s">Because</a> there's nothing in the contract that mandates that they do that job each and every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4152.839s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to move the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4155.86s">Call</a> for that in two weeks, please.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4821.042s">Any</a> one of those signs, are either one of them interior lit? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4823.543s">Yes,</a> this sign is internally illuminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4830.85s">So</a> that's the only one that's going to be interior lit, that high one?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4839.992s">Then</a> the question becomes on the big AC sign, does that have an 11 o'clock curfew? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4848.353s">Like</a> across the street, let's say Kelly's Roast Beef. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4854.514s">I</a> believe they have an 11 o'clock time and they change it to one on their time that the interior lit sign stays on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4865.648s">I</a> think you just need to better check, because if we give you that, you're looking for that 24 hours a day to be lit?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4872.832s">Because</a> you're going to be right next to another company that I believe has a cutoff in its time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4877.774s">So</a> I think before, I think you need to. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4881.336s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuso.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4900.738s">Mr.</a> President, again, could you put that sign up again? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4904.521s">What</a> are you facing?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4909.225s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4921.493s">Well,</a> Mr. President, we need to be consistent if we're going to be consistent with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4924.74s">And</a> I've got no problem with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4926.604s">It's</a> just that, you know, there's a like business, you know, right next to you that I believe in one point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4933.054s">May</a> I just point out at this— It's open, but I think the sign has to go off by 1 o'clock.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4992.732s">It's</a> just a point of clarification as it relates to that you're facing a residential neighborhood, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5001.676s">There</a> is a residential building to the north of the hotel.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5004.418s">The</a> business that we're talking about is likewise facing a residential neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5008.259s">So</a> all I'm saying is if you've already established a policy or a time, I've got no problem giving it to them 24 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5014.592s">But</a> you're going to have to give the other people 24 hours.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5550.548s">Thank</a> you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5551.829s">Councilor</a> Penter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5553.81s">I</a> appreciate the fact that you're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5555.251s">I</a> support you, but I also understand <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5558.719s">that</a> your development did not come here because of the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5561.4s">Your</a> development came here because of Ted Tai and the business that he has there at Stations Landing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5565.742s">You</a> are the last part of the development of that whole development process over there, that six-story hotel, because when he came in here, it was gonna be in the beginning, but there wasn't a call for it economically. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5575.687s">This</a> City of Medford needs to get out there as a unit, as a community, to look for businesses to come in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5581.19s">They</a> haven't done it for a long period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5583.19s">This</a> Medford City Council is equally to blame, equally to blame, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5586.77s">Because</a> all we do sometimes is talk about it, and nothing's been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5589.571s">There's</a> been no review of the sign ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5591.411s">There's</a> been no review of the taxicab ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5593.411s">And</a> we can go through all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5594.792s">So</a> to get through all of that, you don't want to hear that, because that's not your problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5598.693s">That's</a> our problem over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5600.213s">So</a> all I'm telling you is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5601.373s">You</a> understand that there are rules and regulations, and that's the reason why you got here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5604.914s">And</a> the reason why you're here, rather than going to the Board of Appeals, because it would cost you a hell of a lot of money to go to the Board of Appeals to appeal that, for which you're coming here before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5614.741s">That's</a> the reason why the council put this in its sign ordinance many, many years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5619.222s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5620.482s">And</a> as a result of that, and I think you understand where we're going with all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5624.563s">So</a> there's nothing wrong with a six month review. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5626.484s">As</a> a matter of fact, it might make you a better and a stronger, have a relationship as to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5631.645s">Cause</a> when you can come back here, you can tell us all about the wonderful things you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5635.306s">You</a> know, this city only operates with one and a half people, one and a half people out of an office of community development. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5640.947s">And</a> I guarantee you never saw them once in your whole proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5643.848s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5644.617s">Because</a> the reason we didn't say it, because they just don't have the manpower or the time or the wherewithal to come out there and do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5651.101s">That's</a> all going to change in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5652.541s">There's</a> going to be a new administration, and you're going to see a new life come into this community.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5657.524s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5658.164s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6614.2s">On</a> that particular motion, Rick, I think you forgot to say that they had to spend $200,000 in Somerville to get that $20,000 to come back to the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6623.006s">So</a> that's approximately $200,000 that could have been spent here in the city of Medford that didn't find its way here.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_bq-gVu-g8qk/2025-03-21_bq-gVu-g8qk.html">Medford City Council - August 11, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=377.887s">So</a> on the motion of approval, uh, Councilor Penta, um, Mr. Rumley, can you answer a question please? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=390.599s">The</a> city saloon sitter approaches the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=394.182s">I</a> was looking at you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=394.842s">I</a> couldn't get the words out of my mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=396.023s">I'm</a> saying, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=397.204s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=399.55s">This</a> young lady that's being appointed now, that's a mayoral appointment, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=403.293s">It</a> is, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=404.614s">And</a> how long has the vacancy been there?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=408.257s">Does</a> anybody know how long the vacancy has been?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=415.022s">One</a> full year.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=420.006s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. Solicitor, I know it's not your call, but during this past year, there have been concerns from tenants <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=429.334s">that</a> there was no tenant representative. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=431.114s">So</a> I would hope the young lady becomes very cognizant of all the concerns, whether you agree or disagree, to bring them forward to the board, because there hasn't been anyone there for a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=441.957s">And</a> that's really what's needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=443.877s">You</a> need representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=445.937s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1109.334s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1109.634s">That</a> falls in concert with this.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1217.62s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1218.381s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1219.542s">You</a> have the amendment, you said?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1223.626s">Why</a> don't we let him finish his presentation?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1473.88s">Mark.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1474.901s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1477.812s">the</a> folks that are involved with the community gardens do wonderful work. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1482.673s">And</a> it's these folks as individuals and a lot of them don't have the space at their own personal residence where they could have this type of a garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1492.235s">But</a> I have some concern over this as it relates to number one, I'm passing this tonight without knowing and having a lot of the representatives, you know, and some of the terms here is called plotters. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1501.997s">But</a> one of the things that stands out at me is the mayor has all five appointments. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1508.176s">And</a> since you're asking the council to make a vote of acceptance, not you, but the administration is, uh, I think the council should have one representative of their choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1518.001s">And</a> I think the, the plotters or the garden people, they should have a representative as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1522.684s">Um,</a> and leave all five exclusively to the mirror. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1525.326s">I</a> think at this point in time, I think would not be fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1529.088s">That's,</a> that's number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1530.949s">Number</a> two, it's called the river bend garden folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1533.47s">And</a> you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1533.91s">Exempting</a> them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1534.771s">They've</a> done a wonderful job for 12 years down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1537.555s">And</a> everything down there really works well. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1540.277s">And</a> they probably have set the tempo as to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1543.38s">So</a> I guess the question is, what are they doing so right that we need a commission to say we've got to correct something going forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1553.148s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1553.709s">These</a> are questions that I think, you know, and the committee will hold. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1557.592s">Second</a> of all, I have no idea where the $10,000 figure came from.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1586.106s">But</a> the Riverbend folks, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1587.941s">didn't</a> have any kind of a cap. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1589.361s">They</a> just adjusted themselves and paid for whatever their expenses were and have been through the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1594.863s">And</a> if I'm reading this correctly, it indicates over here, um, that not only are these, uh, plot families, um, plot holders along with donations, and they're also going to be charged a fee and inclusive of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1608.706s">Um,</a> the question is if, if I had my particular garden down there and I was working on it, now I'm going to be charged the fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1617.048s">And</a> then, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1618.534s">If</a> we are putting all of these together, and I believe it says, um, and line over here, it says each community garden or group of gardens in the case of gardens, plural of eight or fewer plots, she'll have at least one representative on the commission.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1635.304s">So</a> if they have one representative on the commission, the question then becomes if they have one representative on the commission and the mayor has all five, how do you, how do you get to that one member on the commission? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1645.79s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1646.811s">But,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1647.757s">Just</a> put that aside as a separate thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1649.799s">I'm</a> just concerned over the fact that it's another tax and a fee on people who are doing something voluntarily, who are willing to take a parcel of land, cultivate it, grow it into a garden, for the purposes of which they so choose. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1664.67s">I</a> believe it's on a first come, first served basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1667.712s">And</a> I guess the Riverbend folks are the best example to show you this, that through the last 12 years, they paid for all their expenses themselves, and they've shared it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1676.217s">Now,</a> the question then becomes, if, in fact, we get all these plotters, as they're called, to have to pay an annual fee or whatever it might be, and it goes into a pool, who then makes the determination if one of these locations needs an upgrading and wants an upgrading? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1693.71s">And</a> if I'm in the river bend or X bend, whatever it might be, and I feel that I don't want that money to go there, I want it to stay right here in my own section, how are we going to address this and handle this?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1708.719s">So</a> having no form of function without the ordinance right now, if you go to the one on Winthrop Street, they're basically working on their own. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1714.981s">If</a> you go to McNally Park, they're basically working on their own. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1719.522s">I</a> think it's a good idea to have some kind of oversight, but to have it this controlled and taxing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1728.785s">To</a> me, it's like another tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1730.578s">on</a> somebody wanting to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1732.198s">It's</a> a fee.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1737.899s">It's</a> a fee.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1739.24s">It's</a> another fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1739.9s">So</a> you're asking someone who never had to pay a fee before, now they're going to have to pay a fee, over and beyond expenses.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1750.262s">No,</a> I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1751.782s">But</a> you've also been allowed to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1753.822s">And</a> for the last 12 years, there's a group.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1789.646s">But</a> how do you get a fee? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1790.647s">How</a> do we get to this issue of a fee? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1792.148s">Who's</a> going to make the determination of the fee?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1814.927s">But</a> if you already have a group of people that are doing that on their own, what I don't understand is you're saying going from them forward, it's going to come under a commission.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1887.969s">The</a> only real thing, lastly, the only real thing is the $10,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1892.552s">If</a> I was a plotter, and I was to see this ordinance, and I was to see it's going to be up to and not exceeding $10,000, does that mean at any point in time, at any one of these developments, any future development, if an assessment had to be to carry the next person forward, but in my small little world, whether it's on Winthrop Street or wherever, I'm going to be charged an additional amount of money to get to that point? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1916.729s">Because</a> if I understand this correctly, their fees and whatever, it all goes into a pool, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1921.633s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1922.333s">And</a> in that pool, whatever the location might need that's making the request, that's where the money's going to go if the commission votes on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1929.277s">That's</a> correct, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1929.837s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1930.337s">So,</a> like I said, if I'm in my own little world and I don't want it to go there, I want it to keep it on my one subscription, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1937.561s">Councilor,</a> I could tell you this.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1953.987s">To</a> me, a realistic figure would probably be $3,000 to start, because I'm quite sure this is all a minimal. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1959.191s">$3,000</a> is fine by me. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1961.573s">I</a> would move, Mr. President, that $10,000 be reduced to $3,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1964.915s">And</a> let's just see where this gets itself going and how the cost factor goes.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2280.785s">Mayor,</a> two members of the mayor, one from the council and one from the clubs.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2314.451s">All</a> right.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2340.706s">One</a> member from the club is in the three-year term.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2389.529s">And</a> then it revolves out. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2393.865s">At</a> the outset, the council gets one two-year term, because we read every two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2399.507s">The</a> Guiding Club gets one three-year term, and the mayor gets two three-year terms, and he gets the one-year term. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2406.029s">Starting</a> off, that's what you said.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2409.51s">At</a> the outset. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2411.311s">Point</a> of clarification, Mr. President?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3916.662s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3917.482s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3917.762s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3918.803s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3920.723s">I</a> find this very intriguing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3922.104s">I'm</a> a very nuts and bolts guy when it comes to dollars and cents. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3924.885s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3925.365s">So</a> please just explain to me, you said it costs $6,000 to get to Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3929.567s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3930.028s">Is</a> that shared by the 13 folks that are there now?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3964.497s">OK,</a> so now with that being said, and you folks that are out there working it, what do you actually think it's going to cost to get through this first year?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4011.84s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4012.121s">Now,</a> taking what you just said into consideration, Mr. Clerk—I mean, Mr. Solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4017.485s">Mr.</a> Solicitor, could you come here real quick? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4019.306s">Because</a> she's getting to the nub of my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4023.149s">When</a> we talked about the original dollar amount of $10,000, and now we have it down to $5,000, and just hearing the young lady in the back of the hall just basically say what they're purchasing and buying. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4034.297s">Does</a> this mean that the fees that this new ordinance is going to have is going to cover all that so you folks don't have to pay for that or not? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4042.982s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4043.983s">So</a> I guess my question is, what is this money going to be used for for the fees?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4071.504s">I</a> guess I'm just confused because if you folks are donating all your own time, effort, and money into all of this, I think, can you just explain it better?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4139.156s">That's</a> what I think people need to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4142.238s">Thank</a> you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4142.879s">I</a> appreciate that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4146.021s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4146.281s">That's</a> good.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5061.112s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5176.073s">Membership.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5447.875s">Mr.</a> President, two questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5450.156s">Um,</a> number three says the director of office of energy environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5454.377s">And</a> since this is all on Parkland, is there any reason why this is not coming under the park board commission? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5460.132s">rather</a> than the Office of Energy and Environment?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5503.785s">And</a> the second part of number three, it said she'll have the authority in accordance with all. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5509.168s">Does</a> that mean that that individual, whoever he or she might be, can refuse a vote of the commission to make an expenditure?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5523.389s">But</a> it says here, the director of the Office of Energy and Environment shall have the authority to approve.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5533.355s">But</a> I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5534.136s">It</a> says to approve expenditures. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5535.517s">And</a> if that individual, now or in the future, does not feel that the expenditures are warranted, wouldn't that be in contravention to the commission?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5598.201s">But</a> if this is just a matter of personal choice, that's what I'm concerned about.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5619.331s">So</a> who makes that final decision?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5997.271s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5999.645s">Carol,</a> you guys and your girlfriend, you do a wonderful job. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6002.626s">And</a> I think the idea, it's not about raising the money, it's just the awareness. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6005.228s">People</a> need to know what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6006.968s">They</a> shouldn't be afraid to talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6008.249s">It's</a> like the addiction that we have here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6010.81s">Huge</a> addiction problem, you know, on drugs and what it does to people and how it can kill them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6015.872s">Same</a> thing with ovarian cancer, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6017.653s">And</a> unfortunately, it's something you have to deal with. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6020.574s">And</a> I think people need to live with it and people have to understand it and people have to accept it and people have to work for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6026.077s">And</a> we have great medical staff here in the Commonwealth of Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6029.165s">But</a> once again, you do our city proud by doing this, make me feel good about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6033.809s">I</a> have life experience as it relates to this, so I thank you for what you do.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6172.487s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6173.448s">To</a> let a citizen in the audience speak as it relates to a problem that she has.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6425.045s">Patty,</a> can you answer this question, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6429.207s">What's</a> the response been back to you from this Park Medford place? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6433.709s">I</a> mean, these people that are from Tennessee that are running this place.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6502.082s">I</a> think the fact of what you're saying just represents the failure within the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6510.302s">The</a> city of Medford is equally responsible for you getting those tickets, because if they're giving out more permits than the spaces are allotted, and they're not making provisos for it, what they're doing is they're grabbing the money, just like this group from Tennessee are, taking the money, and they don't really care where it's coming from and how. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6526.953s">It</a> doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6528.354s">This</a> does not cultivate a business community at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6531.856s">Bad</a> enough that the kiosks are doing what they're doing, and now they want to put kiosks in the parking lots, which again becomes another issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6537.628s">The</a> fact of the matter is that you are a legitimate business person and you should be treated the same as everyone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6543.193s">But</a> for that person to indicate to you because they're carrying heavy boxes, how do they know that that person's carrying heavy boxes as compared to what you carry or what you don't carry? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6552.2s">It's</a> absolutely wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6553.421s">And</a> that's the problem with this whole system. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6555.923s">It's</a> an out-of-state company and it's not in-state. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6557.865s">They</a> take 68% of our money and they run with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6560.327s">The</a> fact of the matter is, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6561.817s">It's</a> anti-business, it's anti-consumer, it's anti-friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6564.738s">There's</a> no reason for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6566.758s">So</a> as a business community, I would hope that the Chamber of Commerce recognizes this because they have a big stake to play in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6572.98s">The</a> Chamber supposedly is the spokesperson for all the business people. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6576.861s">And</a> as a business person and as a member of the Chamber, if in fact this is going on, somebody needs to speak up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6582.583s">It's</a> quite obvious you're not going to get it from the Conor office because that's his program, this is what he wants. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6587.584s">But</a> this is the only place people can come to speak about this and understand and recognize the fact <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6591.912s">that</a> this is wrong, this is so terribly, terribly wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6595.674s">And</a> if I were you, I'd probably look at the, I would probably go to the city solicitor and say, before you entertain anything legal or otherwise, this has got to stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6604.779s">Because</a> if he is representing the city of Medford as legal counsel, and the city of Medford is issuing these permits, knowing that there are not enough spaces, and they don't do what you said, which is very simple, just park on the street for the time period in question, then what are you supposed to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6621.399s">You</a> can't do anything other than get a ticket, but the city can do something about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6625.922s">They've</a> changed the amount of kiosks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6627.664s">They've</a> changed the dollar amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6631.466s">We</a> can go on and on in this whole subject matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6633.968s">It's</a> not good, it's not healthy, and it's not business-friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6636.45s">It's</a> not consumer-friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6638.391s">And</a> I'll sit here and say, I apologize for your problems that you have, because this is just so terribly wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6646.357s">And</a> hopefully, after the first of the year, this will be changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6649.563s">This</a> will be changed.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7685.21s">Chief.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7686.78s">I'm</a> going to greatly disagree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7688.34s">I</a> don't appreciate that last statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7690.481s">If</a> you have a job that you have to be out of the square in every 15 minutes, maybe you should look for a different job.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7698.002s">Well,</a> you know, if somebody wants to be in Medford Square for location, I don't care if they were in there every five or 10 minutes, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7703.323s">The</a> problem is there was a legitimate taxpayer citizen came up here to tell you her concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7708.124s">To</a> me, the nub to the whole matter is if a business person can park in front of their place, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7714.508s">because</a> allegedly they're carrying heavy boxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7717.17s">Who</a> was he or who was she to make a determination as it relates to another business person? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7721.634s">That's</a> number one.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7724.877s">You</a> heard it tonight, all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7725.858s">I</a> just heard that tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7727.019s">But</a> this is new. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7728.34s">We've</a> had a multitude of problems with this company since they've been in here, dating back to when they first started in October, when the contract was signed, and they officially took off on January 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7737.828s">And</a> then it took from January, and we heard they were going to go in March, and then we heard they were in May. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7742.408s">It</a> wound up until the end of July before they even found their way over to the senior center to explain to the seniors that they were going to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7749.793s">We</a> have kiosks on High Street, as you and I have spoken about, in front of two-family homes that don't belong there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7755.396s">We</a> have kiosks that are going to go in parking lots where the signage hasn't even changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7759.799s">The</a> parking lots are supposed to be three-hour municipal parking lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7763.542s">And</a> now you're going to put a kiosk in there with signs that say 15 minutes, 30 minutes, one hour, and two hours, all in the same parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7772.179s">How</a> is a kiosk going to address that? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7774.12s">How</a> is anyone supposed to figure that out? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7776.262s">You</a> tell me. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7776.922s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7778.624s">To</a> me, I told you, Chief, they got to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7781.235s">It</a> is unfriendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7782.236s">It's</a> unhealthy. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7782.976s">It's</a> poor for business. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7784.197s">We</a> are not like downtown Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7786.138s">We're</a> not even like Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7787.679s">We're</a> just like Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7788.68s">We</a> want to get ourselves back in action. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7791.001s">We</a> want to get a downtown vibrancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7792.802s">We</a> want to get all our little cities and towns, the sister cities that make up this community, to have a collage of types of businesses that entice people. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7800.667s">The</a> whole idea was not revenue enhancement. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7803.209s">It</a> was revenue enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7804.79s">And</a> if you had revenue enforcement, maybe every two hours, and that's more than enough time to be on the street, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7809.793s">and</a> the cars were ticketed, and they were tagged, and maybe they were told, the message will get out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7813.938s">You</a> don't need more than two hours in most of these businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7816.46s">Hairdressers,</a> for example, in West Medford, some of them go maybe two or three hours, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7821.226s">And</a> because of the concern that was brought up by the city, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7825.602s">that</a> it was the city people that were doing the signs and that was against the union. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7829.063s">I</a> mean, the company was doing the signs and the city should have been doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7831.864s">It's</a> a union contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7832.985s">They</a> haven't even changed the signs yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7834.765s">So</a> now you're going to be put these kiosks in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7836.386s">You're</a> going to be charging people after two hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7838.367s">You</a> got to tell them to move a car. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7840.007s">And</a> the most stupidest thing of all of this thing is how do you park yourself in a spot?

<a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7877.469s">To</a> cause all this confusion, animosity, and concern? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7880.47s">No,</a> Chief, it's not good for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7882.331s">You're</a> my friend and I told you this before, this is not your job, not your responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7888.273s">It</a> doesn't belong in your bailiwick, it belongs in a commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7891.774s">It</a> doesn't belong in the diversity director of this city to be the hearings officer for someone who might get a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7898.036s">It</a> doesn't take two months for tickets to be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7900.777s">That's</a> insanity, that's crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7903.14s">And</a> if somebody wants to go there, and it's closed on a Saturday because they can't get there on a workday, that's not fair either. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7910.447s">But</a> it's OK for them to give tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7912.268s">And</a> if you don't like it, we'll appeal it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7914.03s">You</a> know what happens on the appeal process? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7916.072s">Somebody</a> says, I'm not coming back. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7917.553s">I'll</a> pay it, but I'll never come back here again. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7919.355s">Go</a> to West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7920.596s">Go</a> to South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7921.297s">Go</a> to Haines Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7922.558s">I'll</a> leave the name of the personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7923.839s">One</a> particular business is off 8% to 12%. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7925.3s">8%</a> to 12% because of that crazy chaos. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7929.327s">And</a> you know where they go? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7930.247s">They</a> go down the street where they say, like saying business, and there's no kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7934.429s">You</a> tell me how that's fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7935.749s">It's</a> not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7937.07s">And</a> you know it's unfair, and I know it's unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7939.811s">That's</a> why this whole thing is just not good for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7943.512s">And</a> if the city administration, before he bows out, recognizes it and says, I made a mistake, let's correct it, let's get rid of it, and come in with a program, I will stand here and publicly compliment him. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7953.456s">I</a> said that to you before. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7954.676s">I</a> will stand up publicly and compliment the mayor for recognizing the mistake that he made. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7959.587s">and</a> correcting it because he doesn't want to hurt the business people. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7962.409s">It's</a> definitely not good for the taxpaying citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7966.011s">Go</a> into the shops in Medford Square and ask them what they think about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7969.313s">Go</a> ask the customers what they think about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7972.355s">Why</a> should I go and worry about it? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7973.856s">I</a> was with a lady last Friday in Haines Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7977.118s">The</a> poor woman went into the shop to get her clothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7979.8s">She</a> comes out with her clothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7981.201s">She</a> had 18 minutes left on her ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7983.542s">And</a> right number, 18 minutes, and she still got the ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7987.004s">That's</a> not the first time I've heard that story. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7989.105s">You</a> don't like it, appeal it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7990.767s">Well,</a> that's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7991.567s">Maybe</a> there's something wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7992.528s">If</a> these things all run off the sun, maybe the sun isn't working right, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7996.89s">It</a> certainly doesn't work right for those solar compacts that Waste Management has. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8001.173s">The</a> doors are open and the rubbish is all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8004.195s">So,</a> Chief, you're my friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8006.356s">I</a> like you, but I do not agree in this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8009.778s">It's</a> a complete disaster to the operation of this community.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8139.095s">But</a> chief, if we really want to be business friendly, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8142.43s">and</a> we're comparing a business-friendly to a commuter pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8147.131s">Why</a> don't we just cut back on the commuter passes and give more of the business passes, and at least if you have given out 134, you have 134 spots.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8212.461s">And</a> West Bedford Chief, on Playstead Road, as you know, you're lucky if there's one car there during that day, that $5 parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8219.007s">And</a> all those people that were parking there now have put themselves into the neighborhood, OK?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8273.674s">I</a> think Councilor Marks alluded to this fact a few months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8276.462s">where</a> they have these handheld devices that'll acknowledge how long the car is there, and it comes up, and it just comes right off the computer handheld. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8284.745s">They</a> have that in Somerville in spots where they don't have meters because the people are walking by, and they have a person in each one of the squares.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8327.366s">But</a> Chief, all we're asking for is to start off small and just work our way up to it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8336.414s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9206.976s">Let's</a> do this one more time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9208.796s">On</a> an annual basis, we are charged a water and sewer dollar amount from the MWRA, correct?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9220.119s">And</a> that assessment, and that's a result of what we as a community use for water by cubic feet, and we're back charged on the sewer side at 120% of the water bill.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9244.248s">But</a> it comes out to the charge of 120% of our water bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9248.79s">Now,</a> you're asking us to vote for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9251.971s">I</a> know we have the committee to hold tonight where there was a whole bunch of explanations as to where and why these things are going. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9257.813s">And</a> of course, my question is, why didn't we just do this earlier? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9261.385s">We're</a> only sitting on $7.5 million of money, but that's beside the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9266.167s">Just</a> looking and trying to understand this, if 45% of this loan is going to be a grant from the MWRA, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9277.232s">That</a> is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9278.013s">The</a> remaining 55%, which is $1,166,000, has to be repaid. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9279.413s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9279.894s">So</a> as we are repaying them, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9291.19s">during</a> the next five years, we're also going to be assessed by them in the next five years for water and sewer charges, correct?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9299.974s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9301.514s">So</a> in essence, since we're already being charged an assessment for what we're using, we're really not getting this money for nothing because we're being charged. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9314.439s">And</a> even though this is an isolated project, which is costing $2.1 million, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9319.478s">we</a> have to pay back $1,168,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9320.878s">And</a> I've been thinking about that from the time we left that room till over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9326.62s">I</a> think the city has one of two options. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9330.14s">They</a> either go this route or rather than saying, just pay it off over a five year period of time, since we're going to be taking it out of the sewer account for which is half of the water and sewer account. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9346.224s">Why</a> don't we just pay it off the first year? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9348.14s">You're</a> going to have to pay it off one way or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9351.581s">So</a> I guess my question then comes to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9354.502s">I</a> would probably move to amend not one to five years, Mr. President, pay it off within the first year, because you have to pay it off no matter what. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9363.604s">I</a> wouldn't want to wait and procrastinate over five years and realize that I would want to know what my balance is now to go forward on any future endeavors that this might reveal. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9373.247s">You</a> said one to five years, correct?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9377.352s">Up</a> to 1 to 5 years, we could repay this back.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9384.175s">It's</a> a 5-year repayment. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9385.076s">So</a> we can pay that anywhere up to 5 years.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9392.939s">I</a> don't care about the 0%. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9394.88s">I</a> understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9396.081s">But</a> we're going to have to pay it back one way or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9398.202s">So</a> why procrastinate and go through a 5-year, $275,000 deletion? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9402.924s">I</a> would rather have it taken out now and understand what my balance is. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9405.858s">to</a> go forward on other projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9407.919s">Because</a> if something comes up of a major concern, I'm going to then have to worry about $275,000 for year 2, 3, 4, and 5. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9415.363s">And</a> I don't want to think about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9417.224s">So</a> the more I keep thinking about it, we're already being assessed on an annual basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9422.927s">And</a> if we're going to be assessed for the next five years on the sewer charge, and we're paying them back the money that they're loaning us, we're still paying out on their sewer portion of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9434.388s">because</a> we're being assessed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9435.509s">So,</a> with that being said, I'm going to move, Mr. President, that since we are going to accept the grant, that we pay it back year one — within year one of this five-year loan. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9447.955s">Is</a> that what you call it? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9449.016s">A</a> five-year loan moratorium? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9449.896s">Is</a> that what it is? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9450.337s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9450.437s">DeParle</a> That is a five-year loan. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9451.237s">Mr.</a> Schultz Within the five-year loan. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9454.099s">And</a> I move on that question, Mr. President, because I just think, you know, it terminates the whole issue of over a five-year period of time, and it also terminates the fact that over the next four to five years, after the first year, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9464.58s">we</a> have to delete $275,000 out of that account. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9467.942s">Since</a> we're going to have to pay for it anyway, we might as well just get rid of it up front and deal with the remaining balance that we have.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10770.399s">That</a> be paid within the first year because if we're going to delay it over a five-year period of time, I think what that's going to do, I think that's going to <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10778.901s">limit</a> whatever might become as a future project by almost a million dollars and I would rather know up front that that million dollars was gone beginning the second year and just dealing with the residue that's there because I don't want to deal with an uncertainty of a particular project in years two, three, four, or five.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10898.214s">It's</a> within the five year period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10899.955s">You</a> forgot the five years.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10902.237s">You</a> forgot the five years.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10911.332s">No,</a> that's the committee paper that was amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10913.892s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=11010.146s">What</a> had happened was, yes, the council voted for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=11012.428s">It</a> was taken out of the budget, and the rates weren't supposed to go up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=11015.33s">But</a> the Water and Sewer Commission changed the rate structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=11019.128s">into</a> three separate tiers where before they were never. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=11021.89s">So</a> as of last year, after our vote, the mayor empowered them to change the rate structure, for which they've changed twice since last year.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=11908.012s">How</a> wide is the trench going to be?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=11936.845s">So</a> you're going to be almost in the middle of the street.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=11950.296s">I'm</a> going to put a condition on here, Mr. President, that in six months that the city review the street opening to make sure that there were no depressions, because <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=11959.822s">The</a> problem with you folks lately, not you, because you're not digging the hole, is your company comes in and digs holes, and within six months, they just become depressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=11969.108s">And</a> they sometimes can cause some of these potholes that are existing on some of these streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=11973.872s">So</a> I think we also have to look at, Mr. President, the bond amount that the city is charging right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=11982.017s">I'd</a> like to raise it to $100,000 that your company has to leave here within the city of Medford, because if these streets need to be repaired, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=11989.671s">You</a> guys opened it, you should repair it to the way you found it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=11993.753s">There</a> are so many streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=11995.134s">You</a> go up to Doonan Street, you go up to Hillside, you go up to Fulton Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=11999.716s">You</a> guys are all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12000.877s">I</a> know you have to do work, but whoever is filling your potholes or whoever is filling your trenches, you leave a lot to be desired. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12009.533s">That's</a> just me talking on another area.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12012.394s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12012.694s">Move</a> approval with that condition to the city.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12037.502s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12038.803s">No,</a> to the City of Medford, no, to the City of Medford for repairs if they become deficient.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12461.43s">12</a> o'clock, September 1st?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12538.812s">Eddie,</a> you just said, I don't know if it was a slip. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12542.473s">I</a> don't know if you made a slip. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12544.133s">Did</a> you say you can come in up to 12 o'clock on September 1st to get an absentee ballot?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12561.677s">So</a> what happens to all these <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12563.202s">Service</a> people that are overseas, they have to get their ballots when? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12567.005s">Well</a> in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12569.006s">People</a> who are overseas, out of state, they have to get these ballots to you well in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12573.769s">They</a> have to be there before September 1st.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12577.752s">By</a> 5 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12578.793s">Now,</a> when do you open up those ballots?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12582.995s">The</a> ballots, the absentee ballots. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12584.917s">When</a> do you open them up?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12593.04s">OK,</a> but what about the ones that you have to wait till the end of the day when the mail comes in? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12597.063s">When</a> do they count, to the next day?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12607.232s">So</a> whatever mail you get on September 1st, that day, election day, you bring to the respective polls? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12614.158s">That</a> would be too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12615.499s">Well,</a> then how does it work? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12619.165s">If</a> you get the mail later in the day, how do you get it to the polls by 8 o'clock for them to count it?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12627.627s">That's</a> what I just said.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12632.929s">You</a> have the mail up to September 1 on that day.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12652.825s">So</a> nothing's counted the next day. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12654.405s">Everything</a> is counted that night.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12658.966s">Overseas</a> ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12659.646s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12659.967s">That's</a> another.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13048.041s">Well,</a> we have Panera, Snappy Patty, not Snappy Patties. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13051.182s">What</a> is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13052.522s">Smashburgers.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13053.443s">Smashburgers</a> and noodles and noodles going down over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13061.184s">This</a> is really a disgrace what's going on because it's alleged that it's contaminated soil. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13066.065s">It's</a> been covered up and re-covered up, you know, on hot, warm days. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13069.906s">And</a> when the wind blows, that dirt is going all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13072.887s">There's</a> got to be a reason why. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13075.008s">or</a> a problem why that dirt has not been removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13077.65s">I</a> mean, how do you have a triple business development take place over there and have this amount of dirt stay there day in and day out, month in and month out? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13085.834s">So,</a> Mr. President, I'm going to move that the building department and our health inspector go down there, tag them, find them, do whatever it takes, because this is absolutely unacceptable as part of a business project development here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13100.063s">And</a> if the city was on top of this, we wouldn't even be discussing this, but it's quite obvious. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13104.602s">that</a> there is something wrong there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13105.662s">They</a> just, once again this past week, covered it with more new type of clear plastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13110.604s">And</a> I don't know, I can't answer it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13112.485s">The</a> poor people across the street, the lady who's across the street, she's beside herself. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13116.587s">She</a> just can't understand what's going on over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13119.668s">And</a> so is it the responsibility of the three people? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13122.989s">Is</a> it the responsibility of the people that own the parking lot? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13125.27s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13126.19s">But</a> it's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13126.75s">And</a> it's the first time in all my years serving that this amount of dirt <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13131.251s">has</a> hung around after projects gotten started, while the project continues to go forward, and the dirt continues to stay there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13138.016s">So</a> Mr. President, I ask that we move on this expeditiously. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13141.598s">I</a> know we don't meet until the end of September, so I don't want to wait till then. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13144.901s">I</a> think this needs to be resolved immediately, and the fines need to be assessed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13148.603s">Go</a> ahead and do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13149.584s">The</a> city should go ahead and do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13150.725s">But</a> the fact of the matter is, it doesn't belong there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13153.507s">So</a> I move the question and roll call vote.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13160.827s">the</a> Board of Health and the Court of Enforcement, and the Billing Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13163.549s">I</a> said that, the Board of Health.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13589.094s">No,</a> we had talked about it, but I just want to make it as part of the official resolution that these kiosks that are now going in there, the proper signage has yet to be put into the parking lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13599.519s">I</a> mean, I don't know how they can do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13601.08s">Once</a> again, people are just being taxed <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13605.208s">impositioned</a> by these kiosks from these out-of-state bounty hunters. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13609.813s">And</a> there's just no sympathy being left out there for people who don't understand the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13615.879s">At</a> the same time, all they want to do is just keep taxing the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13619.182s">And</a> this is not the way our city should be going. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13621.224s">Again,</a> like I said, it's not good for business. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13624.047s">So</a> I don't know how you can set up these programs, especially when <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13627.697s">Parking</a> is supposed to be three hours in the municipal lots, and these kiosks are now going to be regulated to a maximum of two over 15-minute increments. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13635.963s">Signage</a> isn't properly put up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13637.645s">So</a> I'm going to refer this, Mr. President, Madam President, to our parking commission and Republic Park, and also ask, as a tag-on to this, that they entertain Saturday operating hours at Park Medford on Main Street and Medford.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13657.199s">I</a> want, as a tag along to this resolution, relative toward the unacceptable use of these kiosks in the parking lots, to request also that they entertain staying open on Saturdays as a regular business working day. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13673.291s">Park</a> Medford.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13681.877s">Roll</a> call vote, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13699.389s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13699.949s">The</a> parking meters in the municipal lots are not ready to go, because the signage is not ready, which is supposed to be for three-hour parking lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13708.676s">And</a> as a result of that, I want that referred to the traffic commission.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13712.539s">Traffic</a> commission.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_eDYkuoJMIno/2025-03-21_eDYkuoJMIno.html">Medford City Council - July 21, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=586.005s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=587.906s">Two</a> quick questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=589.427s">In</a> these charts that you have, you have outside seating. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=592.664s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=593.605s">You're</a> proposing, is that going to require a separate license? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=596.567s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=597.568s">You'll</a> be coming back again for that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=610.017s">And</a> is this just like an example of having four, or is that what it's going to be just for?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=713.209s">Well,</a> your food is excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=714.17s">I've</a> been there many times. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=715.231s">And</a> I just need to ask you this last question. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=718.313s">On</a> one of your pages here, you have a blueberry muffin. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=721.933s">The</a> best blueberry muffins came out of Jardin Marsh when they were in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=726.176s">Are</a> they as good? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=728.617s">Tell</a> the people.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=907.588s">Quick</a> question. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=910.249s">That's</a> one half. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=910.969s">What's</a> the percent on the remaining portion of the loan?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1150.785s">Just</a> a point of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1154.627s">Is</a> there any way that we can get a copy of this so you're not reading it, so we have this information ahead of time? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1159.651s">We</a> never got any of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1161.715s">And</a> two members of the council aren't even here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1164.576s">You're</a> asking for $2 million, and you're reading to us what we're supposed to be understanding now. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1170.379s">So</a> I think it would be more appropriate if we had copies of this to understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1175.221s">I</a> mean, this is a lot to digest for you selling this, so, you know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1186.686s">But</a> it would be interesting for us to know what we're going to be voting on. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1191.668s">and</a> have all the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1193.389s">You</a> have the information there. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1194.789s">We</a> don't have it here.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1198.371s">Let's</a> have copies of whatever you're talking about made available.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1327.293s">They're</a> talking to us for the first time about a $2 million project. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1332.015s">We're</a> just hearing about this, trying to understand it while you're talking. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1337.318s">And</a> with two members not being here, Mr. President, I just respectfully suggest that we just lay this on the table until we can get our information at hand for the purposes of understanding it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1349.624s">When</a> was the grant applied for?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1360.424s">But</a> you're talking about what you're going to do.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1363.747s">Yeah,</a> and you're asking us to vote on this.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1368.41s">But</a> you're asking us to vote on it tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1370.492s">You've</a> seen it, you've worked on it, and you know what it's about.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1414.027s">which</a> is November. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1415.448s">But</a> I'll finish Louise. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1416.328s">We</a> have a meeting I think is August 11th.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1418.63s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1419.23s">So</a> we can lay this on the table, discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1421.451s">And</a> when August 11th comes, the council can vote on it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1445.923s">Is</a> there any reason why we had to wait this long?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1451.728s">This</a> past Friday? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1452.889s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1452.969s">And</a> you want us to vote on it tonight because it has to take three readings before August 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1457.153s">Is</a> that what you're saying?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1460.055s">And</a> we have over $7.5 million in a surplus money in our water and sewer account. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1465.981s">I</a> have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1466.641s">For</a> which we wouldn't have to pay any interest on. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1468.988s">There</a> is no interest under this loan. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1471.449s">Why</a> are we rushing into this?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=2279.023s">We</a> asked for a copy of what you applied for. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=2283.047s">You</a> gave us something dated September 16, 2014.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=2299.602s">Who</a> is the application? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=2300.343s">We</a> asked for a copy of the application.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=2361.681s">What's</a> the date on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=2364.082s">Today.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=2364.362s">So</a> that's ending June 30th?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=2368.497s">Can</a> we get a copy of that also?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=2382.38s">Louise,</a> this is important information. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=2384.24s">It</a> would be nice to get that ahead of time so we could review it.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3374.219s">Wait</a> a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3375.199s">You</a> can't have the amendment and then vote for this because one offsets the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3381.302s">Fine.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3382.182s">So</a> what do we do? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3383.163s">Vote</a> for the amendment first. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3384.764s">So</a> on the amendment, Sevid, do we need a roll call on that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3480.088s">Well,</a> if you're making the request for the money to do the work and you can come up with a figure that's less than what's needed and you're still accomplishing the job, what's the problem? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3493.114s">This</a> grant, I don't see anything in this application other than a date stating September of 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3500.732s">So</a> with September of 2014 and with the figures that are in here, are you using the figures that are in here in 2015? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3508.574s">I</a> don't know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3519.458s">So</a> you have anticipated projects to be done with a cost proposal, correct?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3524.259s">Where</a> is that? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3524.859s">That's</a> another thing we didn't get.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3533.592s">Well,</a> you know, it's unfortunate, Louise, because you say we will make sure we're going to get them. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3537.675s">You're</a> asking us to vote for something, and you're asking us to tell us this is where it's going to be up to Project 5, and we have to ask the questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3545.519s">Where</a> are the documents? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3546.599s">And</a> you want us to vote on something. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3548.62s">It's</a> really not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3550.802s">It's</a> not an intelligent way to make a presentation asking for $2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3556.004s">That's</a> my position.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3594.778s">Just</a> a point of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3596.278s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3597.098s">If</a> we don't apply for that, we have over $7.5 million sitting in our own Water and Sewer Enterprise account that can accomplish the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3603.7s">So</a> why would you make anyone want to think that if we don't do this, we don't have the money to do this project, when we do have the money to do this project?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3633.586s">And</a> we already have it, with over $4 million in a combination of over 7 1⁄2 million with water and sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3638.65s">So</a> since this is a sewer part project, I don't understand what the problem here is. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3645.754s">Beside</a> not getting the information timely like we should have, <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3648.564s">and</a> having a committee of the whole ahead of time to discuss it and understand it and understanding what council along with current has just asked for taking 575 out of the retained earnings portion of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3660.527s">I</a> just don't understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3661.347s">I</a> mean, how do you explain this to the taxpayers of this community that this is the way to do business? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3667.608s">I</a> don't understand this.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3928.948s">On</a> that subject, when we talk about leverage, you're leveraging the taxpayers' money that have been sitting in a non-interest-paying account for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3935.753s">We're</a> leveraging our ability to borrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3939.476s">We're</a> leveraging the money that the taxpayers have been paying that has accumulated approximately $7.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3945.34s">This</a> is a very important subject matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3947.582s">Tonight,</a> we had a Committee of the Whole meeting on the CPA, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3952.225s">It's</a> a community preservation act. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3953.847s">Now,</a> if you want to compare that to the $2 million, I think the Community Preservation Act could have weighed it to August, and that could have been our Committee of the Whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3960.388s">This</a> is a matter of the process and the priorities that take place here in this community, and this is too important of an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3966.19s">We</a> have the money to spend for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3968.11s">We</a> have our reserves account of $4.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3971.111s">I</a> just don't think the process was presented properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3974.071s">When</a> you have to come to a meeting and ask for the information, <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3977.171s">and</a> then they have to go and Xerox it during the course of the meeting and you still don't have all the locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3982.729s">And</a> as Councilor Caraviello just alluded to, <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3984.697s">with</a> the 19 catch basins. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3986.318s">We</a> don't even know which catch basins there are. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3989.32s">This</a> is such an important issue that this council has been talking about for so many, many months. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3994.384s">INI,</a> leak detection, water and sewer construction, and street reconstruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3998.527s">The</a> Winthrop Street Rotary, we had many conversations over that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4001.209s">Committee</a> of the Whole meeting's over that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4003.871s">And</a> tonight we're asking for $2.1 million, quick, quick, quick, because the MWRA is saying that if we don't have this by August 20th, we're gonna lose our-
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4050.317s">With</a> all due respect to my colleague, Mr. President, he had his opportunity to speak and I'm going to have mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4054.221s">And</a> mine is very simply this. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4055.882s">You</a> know, you're talking about talking about it for 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4058.1s">And</a> each and every—for the last five to six years, you've had an accumulated—an accumulated net surplus that never went back to the rate payers in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4065.987s">There</a> was a gentleman over here that just gave you a sighting section of the law that turned around and told you if there was a surplus at the end of the year and there was no ongoing projects—and I think the projects has to be within a 90-day startup period of time—that that surplus was supposed to go back to the rate payers of this community, so they don't have to pay a water and sewer rate increase in their bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4082.582s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4089.341s">The</a> other part of this whole situation is the presentation, the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4094.704s">What</a> do we consider to be important here? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4096.925s">On</a> this particular night, we're talking about $2.5 million or $2.1 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4103.009s">We</a> have to ask for the information, and we still don't have all the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4107.451s">I</a> think it's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4108.772s">We</a> have access to our money and the retained earnings. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4111.235s">I</a> feel very comfortable in going there, and I feel very comfortable in knowing that the ratepayers' money will now be used for something rather than sitting there, as the administration says, the more we keep it in the air, it increases our bond rating. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4122.46s">I'm</a> not worried about bond rating anymore, because the taxpayers, their streets, their sidewalks, their sewer infrastructure is beyond repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4129.343s">When</a> you talk about first time in 10 years, well, where was the city 10 years ago? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4133.665s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4134.226s">Where</a> was the city 10 years ago? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4135.568s">The</a> city wasn't doing what it should have done 10 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4138.211s">You've</a> done all the parks over three times, but you let the streets, and you let the water, and the sewer, and the ironite deteriorate to the point that it is right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4145.981s">No,</a> I'm not going to vote for this tonight, because we do have the alternative, and the alternative is taking out of retained earnings. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4151.828s">And</a> when anyone has to come to that podium and try to force and compel a city council to vote for something because you're in a time squeeze and this council didn't even have enough between itself to figure out to call a meeting rather than wait for the August meeting or the July meeting because of the importance of this, shame on this council and shame on the leadership of this council because we should have been informed about this, had the meeting with the water and sewer people, the city engineer Louise Miller and everyone else concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4178.037s">To</a> put our backs against the wall on something that we still don't know that's dated, and I don't care what anyone says, dated September 2014, still doesn't cut the mustard for me, and I am not going to take its first reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4189.162s">I'm</a> going to use the option that we have in our city revenue, in our city reserves, and the retained earnings of our water and soil.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4261.236s">B</a> comes before 8-0? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4263.857s">It's</a> the amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4265.038s">She's</a> amending the main motion.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4355.861s">Louis,</a> let me ask you this question.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4361.907s">You're</a> saying it has to take its readings. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4364.949s">So</a> if it takes its first read—if it takes its first reading and it's into its second before the third takes place in August, what's the problem? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4376.01s">As</a> long as it's taking its readings, it isn't like it's not taking its readings, it's taking its readings.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4418.544s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4421.805s">Council</a> meeting before the next meeting.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4447.133s">Mr.</a> Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4448.454s">Councilor</a> Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4449.154s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4527.121s">Mr.</a> President, I'd like to ask Mr. Rumley, if he wouldn't mind, there are a group of folks out here with some children. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4531.603s">They</a> would like to address the Council as it relates to the issue in their neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4536.166s">So</a> rather than go into Executive Session, could you just wait to let them speak first? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4541.296s">You</a> mind? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4541.916s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4542.477s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4551.822s">What</a> is this mysterious matter, Councilor? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4553.963s">There</a> are residents out there that would like to speak on the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4557.165s">Are</a> they on the agenda?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4560.247s">No,</a> you don't.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4567.991s">So</a> it isn't a trick.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6236.961s">One</a> of the things that I heard here tonight was there is an inconsistency of traffic enforcement in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6243.366s">And</a> some of the suggestions offered by Councilor Knight and as Councilor Caraviello just alluded to, these are things that definitely need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6250.412s">One</a> of the things that I would have a special interest in would be having a truck enforcement unit within our Method Police Department, because there are just so many trucks that are traveling through our community at high rates of speed that that's a serious concern that we have here right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6266.882s">Unfortunately,</a> this administration, you know, has not wished to delve into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6271.805s">I</a> can assure you, after January, it will be delved into. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6275.808s">And</a> as a result of that, we will make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6279.643s">public</a> safety is looked upon seriously and not just as a temporary political fix, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6287.069s">The</a> public safety of this community is the backbone of why people want to live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6291.892s">In</a> today's edition, I think it was in the Boston Globe, it said we're in the lowest third tier of people wanting to live here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6301.48s">This</a> is the latest report that just came out today. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6304.362s">And</a> as a result of, pardon me, <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6310.405s">lowest</a> tier. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6317.068s">You</a> really want to know why you're living here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6320.249s">Just</a> because your real estate values are going up, is it because of the school system? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6323.79s">Is</a> it because of the streets? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6324.871s">Is</a> it because of your accessibility to 93? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6326.311s">Is</a> it your accessibility to public transportation? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6329.373s">It</a> certainly has nothing to do with your downtown environment, because there's nothing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6333.834s">There's</a> no economic development in these squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6336.355s">They've</a> been laying in abyss for such a long period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6340.926s">We</a> really need to do an awful lot of work as to find out what our city's about and where it needs to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6347.89s">You</a> know, when you talk about Somerville and some of these issues, they've come a long way in a short period of time because everybody worked together. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6355.195s">They</a> put a collective effort together. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6358.036s">Now,</a> there's a gentleman sitting out there, and I don't want to embarrass him, but Mr. Chris DeVita. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6361.719s">He</a> said he was a city planner. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6363.06s">He</a> worked over there in Somerville where they had 12, 14 people at one time. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6367.002s">City</a> of Medford has one and a half people. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6369.098s">This</a> administration only kept one and a half people working full time in that office. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6373.181s">That's</a> a sad commentary to why we don't have development. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6376.343s">We</a> don't have development because there's nothing in this city to go out and develop because there's nobody out there being able to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6382.707s">And</a> I'll just leave you with this last thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6384.568s">It's</a> public safety and streets and roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6386.23s">But</a> this all interconnects with each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6389.592s">It</a> interwines with each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6391.473s">You</a> know, your roads will take you from A to B and B to C and C to D. And that's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6397.157s">Your</a> kids on the roads, bicycles, <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6398.99s">people</a> traveling in the summertime. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6400.991s">During</a> the summertime, more speeding tickets are given up in the city of Medford because the motorcycle patrolmen are out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6407.393s">I</a> met with them last night and had a conversation about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6410.493s">I</a> think what needs to be done is to have you folks call the chief of police and ask him to put his motorcycle unit in particular areas because you folks know where the issues are. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6420.716s">They</a> try to do the best they can with what they have, but if they're being told where the issues might be, <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6426.283s">Let's</a> see where that goes, and let's just see the response that comes from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6430.004s">That's</a> a beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6430.904s">That's</a> a first step. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6432.104s">And</a> then, from there, you can take a step by saying, hey, you either were responded to, or you weren't responded to. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6438.006s">That's</a> the way we're going to fix these problems, one street, one day at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6441.927s">And</a> if we all work together, it can take place, and it will get done. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6445.067s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6515.065s">Well,</a> does your resolution address that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9206.307s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9207.127s">Mr.</a> President, it's quite obvious that since this, uh, I believe since March of this year, that unsightly, um, issue is in front of us at high street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9216.772s">I</a> just don't know why our city administration, <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9220.257s">is</a> failing to take immediate action, corrective action on this particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9224.2s">So</a> with that being said, I would like to have the council consider, as soon as this fall comes into place, an ordinance that addresses a situation such as this. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9236.489s">We</a> have the lean and mean program. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9238.71s">If</a> somebody doesn't care for their property, you can go ahead and do it and charge them on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9243.854s">This</a> is a situation where I think the city can just go out there <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9247.016s">and</a> do what needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9248.877s">I</a> have no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9249.717s">I</a> don't think anybody in this city knows what is wrong with the building, if anything at all, why that scaffolding is all around the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9256.679s">And</a> it's just, it's a detriment, a detriment to business, public safety and public health. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9261.301s">So</a> that being said, Mr. President, I would suggest, I'm going to suggest an offer for our September meeting and that we establish an ordinance that addresses situations such as this. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9271.885s">Now,</a> if it was an ongoing problem that just needed a delay in time, <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9275.482s">and</a> work was ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9276.462s">That's</a> one thing, but absolutely no work is being done taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9280.723s">And</a> as a result of that, that just absolutely detours from any kind of advancement in making Metro square look better than what it is right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9288.285s">So</a> I move on that motion, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9328.638s">I</a> believe the way the issue runs itself is that if work is taking place, and it's ongoing, and it's continuing — The President I understand no work taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9334.102s">Mr.</a> Sperling There is nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9334.902s">Zero.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9335.403s">There's</a> absolutely nothing taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9336.824s">As</a> a matter of fact, the other day, for some reason or another, either kids did it or something else, there was a two-by-four plank that fell off the scaffolding. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9344.128s">So</a> I don't know how it got up there, whatever it did. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9346.69s">But</a> thankfully, nobody got hurt, and it fell down. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9348.952s">So,</a> with that being said — well, beside the audience, Mr. President — strike that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9353.655s">I</a> forgot to say, I think we move immediately to have the building department take the appropriate legal action. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9358.844s">and</a> our legal department take the appropriate legal action against the landowner on this particular matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9363.947s">Very</a> good.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9535.228s">Mr.</a> President, once again, these out-of-state bounty hunters did exactly what they did on Patriots Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9540.491s">They</a> were out there tagging. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9542.132s">I</a> had a long discussion with our chief of police on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9545.435s">He</a> wasn't very happy as to what they were doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9548.557s">I</a> guess most of these tickets, if not all of them, revolved themselves into neighborhood parking areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9555.542s">And</a> it's just not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9556.943s">It's</a> not right for the taxpayers of this community to be subject to this out-of-state company that the mayor decided to bring in. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9563.49s">And</a> just hustle the citizens of this community out of their money, especially on July 4th, one of the sacred holidays that we have in our country, other than Christmas and New Year's and Memorial Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9577.657s">It's</a> just wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9578.797s">And,</a> you know, it's obvious that they're in here just for the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9581.558s">They</a> really don't care about what our community is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9585.16s">And</a> it's just the wrong thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9587.861s">And</a> I would hope, Mr. President, that we can get the chief of police just to <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9591.703s">give</a> us a report back. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9592.763s">I</a> know he said he was going to have a discussion with the Republic Parking Company about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9598.145s">And</a> as an aside to this whole thing, a lot of the folks that go to this Republic Parking Company cannot understand why they're not open on a Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9608.129s">They're</a> running it like a business, and they're tagging people in the business area, but they're not open on a Saturday for anybody to go in there and to resolve any of their problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9617.213s">So</a> a dual request here is to have the chief report back and also <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9621.015s">to</a> make a request that Republic Park can be opened on a Saturday during regular business hours, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9627.059s">Roll</a> call vote.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9635.484s">To</a> report back. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9638.386s">To</a> report back, you know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10052.207s">Unfortunately,</a> the contract was signed on July 1st of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10057.818s">And</a> we're just finding out about it tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10059.719s">We're</a> just getting, because it was just scuttlebutt, and we're getting a copy of it here July 21st, 21 days, 20 days after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10069.563s">It's</a> just a shame that this contract, I have absolutely no idea, haven't had a chance to read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10075.406s">When</a> the public hearing took place this past May, neither the mayor nor anyone from the Medford City government appeared at that public hearing on behalf of the ratepayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10085.07s">I</a> was the only elected official there. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10087.068s">There</a> were 10 other residents from this community who spoke on their concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10090.73s">I</a> don't even know if their concerns were even incorporated into this contract, for which I've yet to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10096.192s">The</a> fact that the mayor has signed a 10-year contract obligating Comcast customers for the next 10 years, when the terms right now are roughly running anywhere from three to five years with cable contracts with renewable options, it just doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10114.443s">Since</a> the mayor decided not to hire a new public works director, letting the new mayor come in in January of this year to make that determination, why would he do the same thing for this? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10124.392s">Why</a> would he obligate the community to a 10-year contract when he has failed to do what he needed to do regarding public access here in this community? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10134.4s">We're</a> sitting on over $330,000 in public access money. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10138.484s">We've</a> never received the financial reports from the old Channel 3 station. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10142.958s">never</a> received the minutes, never received the documents from the State Attorney General's office, never from the Secretary of State's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10151.783s">We</a> don't even know if Channel 3 has been dissolved or not, whether it's been accepted to be dissolved or whether it's legally dissolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10157.207s">I</a> have no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10159.368s">I</a> will address further on, because I'm just getting this document here tonight on peg access, where it sits and where it fits in here in this particular document. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10169.274s">But</a> it's just a damn shame that <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10171.781s">The</a> whole facade of hiring Mr. Peter Epstein from Boston, I believe he gets paid $325 an hour to sit before this community on, I believe, a Wednesday afternoon with 10 folks, including myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10183.864s">We're</a> here to testify, to give our reasons, and not knowing whether any of those reasons were addressed, whether a bona fide research, or even acknowledged to be part of the document that we have before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10196.931s">So</a> anyone who might be a rate payer out there, the only thing I can tell you is, unfortunately, this administration, this mayor, has tied up, once again, your cable contract for 10 years with Comcast, not knowing whether to be bad, good, or indifferent. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10212.48s">And</a> one of the requests were made that the issuing authority go to the legislative body, as they do in a lot of communities, and not to the executive authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10220.244s">So</a> that way, the public hearings would be able to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10222.965s">You'd</a> be able to have an opportunity to talk about it and discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10226.253s">And</a> you'd have more of a reasonable interpretation and transparency as to what could be in your cable rate, in your cable bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10232.816s">I</a> don't know if this is going to cause you an increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10235.077s">I</a> don't know if the senior citizens are going to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10237.479s">I</a> don't know if low-income people are going to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10240.08s">All</a> these things were issues that were brought up at the public hearing this past May. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10246.263s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, again, it's another sad day for ratepayers in this community being saddled with a new 10-year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10255.096s">And</a> this mayor is just riding off into the sunset, leaving this community without even knowing what the options might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10261.558s">I</a> mean, he signed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10262.938s">He</a> delivered it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10263.798s">This</a> council wasn't apprised of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10265.839s">The</a> ratepayers weren't apprised of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10268.339s">And</a> now we're saddled with another 10-year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10271.1s">It</a> doesn't speak well for government interpretation with the customer. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10275.501s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10276.301s">Thank</a> you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10277.061s">Councilor</a> Caraviello.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10340.022s">The</a> whole idea of having this was, it was scuttled, but at the time that I sent my resolution to be on the agenda for this week, and now knowing tonight when Mr. Finn turned around and said he had copies of it already prepared, and I'd seen the city solicitor early, and he had indicated, you know, if you want it electronically through email, but I'd rather have the hard copy. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10360.228s">I'm</a> glad we got it, but the sad, the disturbing part about this is, once again, <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10365.688s">You</a> know, why would the mayor sign a 10-year contract? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10368.591s">Mostly</a> all the cities and towns are into three to five-year contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10372.175s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10372.855s">And</a> number two, having no input into this other than the make-believe dog and pony show that took place here in May. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10380.977s">hiring</a> an attorney to come in here and just elicit commentaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10385.338s">You</a> could hire our own city solicitor to come in to do it, or the assistant city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10390.06s">We</a> don't even know if any of these things are incorporated in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10392.441s">And</a> the hour is what? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10394.441s">10</a> past 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10395.001s">We</a> just get this thing at approximately 10 o'clock tonight and to review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10398.663s">So</a> I would like to review it, bring it up at another time. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10400.963s">Do</a> you want to do it as a separate paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10402.904s">Yeah,</a> do it as a separate paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10404.704s">We</a> can receive this and place it on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10406.225s">But</a> the fact of the matter is, this does not bode well <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10410.32s">for</a> cable TV subscribers who have Comcast, who's probably been rated one of the worst companies in the country to deal business with. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10417.183s">And</a> that's not from me. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10418.363s">That's</a> from the Wall Street people.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10668.49s">Well,</a> before we move to the question, if the gentleman at the podium is correct, once again, why do we have to hear this from a citizen if the mayor is already making a determination?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10691.403s">I</a> hear what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10692.284s">The</a> fact of the matter is Councilor Camuso is not the mayor in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10695.085s">If</a> the mayor is making a determination with the high school and the contractor, <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10698.497s">this</a> council which has been asking week after week, month after month, to be apprised as to what's going on, and we have to hear it from citizens in the newspaper once again to read about it, that that's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10709.519s">That's</a> not transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10710.66s">That's</a> not communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10712.96s">That's</a> the mayor once again just doing whatever he wants when he wants, and it's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10717.461s">It's</a> absolutely wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10723.222s">No,</a> I want to report back. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10724.283s">I</a> want to report back from the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10726.145s">If</a> in fact that's true, what is the mayor intending to do with peg access up at the high school? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10733.166s">Roll</a> call vote on that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10760.89s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10780.913s">Wait,</a> wait, where did you get three? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10781.974s">How</a> did you count those votes again?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10795.164s">It</a> passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10797.025s">Three</a> to two.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2313.606s">A</a> few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2319.028s">Um,</a> there was a discussion early on dating back maybe some two years ago talking about the sewer line from the bridge to the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2329.61s">Is</a> there a sewer line from the bridge to the square?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2342.314s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2342.834s">But</a> there's nothing that goes across the bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2344.696s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2345.556s">Second</a> question basically was, coming over the bridge, there was talk about putting a light at the intersection right there where you could take a left to go up to High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2355.684s">Is</a> there any further discussion on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2359.79s">In</a> other words, moving the traffic.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2364.814s">No,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2365.094s">I'm</a> talking about a traffic light.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2370.298s">So</a> is there going to be a traffic light that's going to take a left on High Street?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2384.629s">The</a> question is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2385.43s">You</a> go over the bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2387.111s">And</a> you can go right into the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2390.125s">Go</a> straight, or can you take a left to go up High Street without having to go all the way around? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2395.607s">That</a> was one of the concerns.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2399.788s">That</a> is not? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2400.989s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2402.289s">You</a> indicated your reconstruction project goals, opportunity to upgrade existing utilities over the bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2412.293s">How</a> and what are they? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2413.873s">What</a> are these upgradings you're going to be giving?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2427.134s">So</a> you're saying that all these utilities are going to be upgrading a long overdue? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2430.716s">Is</a> that what we're saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2431.896s">I</a> mean, I mean, it would be nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2434.617s">I</a> mean, these are questions I'd like to know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2437.178s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2438.439s">Do</a> you know when the first time was when this whole issue on the Craddock bridge came about? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2442.32s">I</a> was not present. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2443.301s">It</a> was in 2002 and it was offered by council long ago regarding <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2447.162s">the</a> safety and the concerns of the Karatek Bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2449.423s">This</a> is now 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2450.043s">That's</a> a long time to wait about all these concerns, if safety is an issue as it was back then. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2460.508s">Let's</a> go to... You talked about under construction on the traffic management plan, you talked about accommodating traffic, pedestrian and buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2470.473s">And</a> you indicated, quote, it looks like it's going to go underneath the bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2473.794s">You</a> folks have no control over bus routes. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2476.002s">This</a> Medford City Council controls where the bus routes go. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2479.404s">And</a> I think that's something that really needs to be considered, because this council has maybe different ideas, maybe the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2485.707s">But</a> to say that you're going to put it underneath the bridge, where a lot of seniors at 99 and 121 now will have to not only walk down to that ring road and then cross over the bridge to get to it, it would be a lot closer and easier for them if they went to Medford Square and they put it temporarily on River Street, turn that into a one-way. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2504.925s">I</a> believe it's nothing more than a three-and-a-half-minute change in a route that accommodates the people, when, in fact, your construction is completely disrupting the entire business community. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2516.607s">I</a> do not believe the temporary relocation has been finalized yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2520.628s">Well,</a> we had asked for someone from the MBTA to be here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2523.169s">Is</a> there somebody in the audience from the MBTA here? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2528.27s">Is</a> there any reason why that was not communicated to them? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2531.841s">This</a> is an important part. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2533.441s">This</a> is a very important part of this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2536.002s">The</a> bus route. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2537.062s">It</a> accommodates, according to your information here tonight, 300 bus trips a day go through Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2543.383s">That's</a> an awful lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2545.083s">That's</a> an awful lot of people that need to take a bus to get to work or go to whatever they need to do during the course of a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2551.605s">And</a> there are options out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2553.825s">And</a> I wouldn't want anyone in this room to think, and anyone who might be watching, that you folks are going to change that bus route, because you're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2560.157s">This</a> Medford City Council will make the recommendation to the MBTA, because we're the only ones that have the power to make and change bus routes. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2566.981s">So</a> I would hope that you go back and you review that as a very serious component. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2573.966s">Also,</a> talk about, and this is really mind-boggling. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2580.209s">We</a> can go back to 2011 when you said the project was gonna cost 2.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2583.772s">Then</a> in 2012, it jumped to 8.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2589.975s">Then</a> in April of 2013, it jumps to $12.7 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2593.896s">Then</a> in June of 2013, it goes down to $10.7 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2598.156s">And</a> now here we are in June 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2600.897s">It's</a> approximately $11 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2602.797s">Does</a> anybody know what the real number is? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2607.018s">The</a> bid price is $11 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2609.118s">So</a> that's the bid price. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2610.198s">That</a> is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2610.698s">So</a> all this in the interim from 2006 coming forward was just speculation. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2614.919s">Those</a> were estimates. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2616.219s">Estimates.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2617.32s">It's</a> a hell of a jump in estimates from 2006 <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2620.059s">$2.5</a> to almost $11 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2622.941s">That's</a> a big change. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2624.501s">Also,</a> one of the concerns, and I believe you're the contractor, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2628.804s">You</a> are, but I mean, he's the contractor. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2630.244s">Has</a> there been any discussion about mitigation here for any damages or anything to help and offset the business community that might be affected by this? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2640.77s">Has</a> mitigation been discussed with either one of you or through the Department of Transportation?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2647.493s">Do</a> you, sir, know anything about this?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2670.036s">So</a> I would have to say no. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2675.239s">So</a> you're saying a project at this scale of $11 million that's going to disrupt <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2680.361s">tie</a> up the city of MidFitness downtown area for approximately three years, and nobody's going to have any empathy, so to speak, toward any type of business or any one business or multiple business that might be either disrupted or put out of business because of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2695.484s">We</a> have a great deal of empathy for the people.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2699.906s">But</a> there's no mitigation.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2705.688s">Sir,</a> we're talking about three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2707.569s">This</a> isn't a one year project. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2708.729s">You're</a> talking about three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2709.93s">I</a> understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2711.03s">That's</a> a long period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2712.771s">Yes,</a> it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2713.912s">You</a> also indicated that you clean up after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2718.053s">I</a> think it was Councilman Mox who asked a question about dirt and dust and disruption and this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2723.678s">Have</a> you folks been before the city's Conservation Commission?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2729.16s">Pardon</a> me?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2731.32s">Today?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2731.9s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2733.241s">But</a> when other businesses have been working in abutting the Karatek Bridge, straight down the river, they had to go to the Conservation Commission first to be told how and what their construction would be and the effect it would have on the river itself.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2758.583s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2759.424s">But</a> while the construction has been taking place so far, nothing has been, you folks or whoever you're employing have done nothing the same as other businesses that had to make sure that anything that fell off the building, any dirt or any rubbish or anything did not go into that, did not go into that river. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2774.647s">It</a> has not taken place yet.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2788.51s">I</a> see it every day.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2792.032s">But</a> you've been there before this morning.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2801.715s">Today</a> is when they first came. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2803.656s">You</a> should have done this before, when you first got the job and you was first awarded. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2807.71s">And</a> you should have known the rules and regulations were on any type of work that abuts that river, that affects the birds and the fish that are in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2818.198s">Like,</a> last weekend, there was tons of fish that were dead in that water after your work took place.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2824.843s">Secretary</a> Nielsen Well, don't tell me please. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2828.686s">Second</a> of all — and lastly, Mr. President,
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2835.09s">Well,</a> you don't have to be insulted.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2836.891s">Well,</a> I'm sorry, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2838.092s">I'm</a> telling you what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2839.233s">So</a> are you telling me I'm not seeing it correctly?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2841.615s">Well,</a> I think you're insulting too, OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2844.017s">If</a> you can't stand here, if you can't stand here and answer the questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2847.661s">Councilor,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2849.062s">Yes,</a> sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2849.422s">Now,</a> one last question, and that's this. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2852.084s">And</a> maybe you can answer it or someone from the Department of Transportation can answer it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2856.148s">Can</a> you explain why it's taken almost three years to do 121 feet?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2868.29s">No,</a> the bridge is only 121 feet.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2870.33s">And</a> to do three years for what you're saying.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2921.252s">I'd</a> just like to make one last comment, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2925.493s">I</a> appreciate the fact that you folks are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2928.395s">But</a> this council has asked for a long period of time to be updated as to where we're going on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2934.577s">And</a> it's unfortunate that you've started the job, and now we're getting the information after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2939.239s">But</a> I do appreciate the fact that you're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2941.26s">I</a> think you hear what all the concerns might be — public safety, road, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2945.498s">displacement,</a> business displacement, if in fact that be the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2948.88s">And</a> if the gentleman that walked away from the podium is insulted, I apologize, but I'm not apologizing for my comments because my comments are what I've seen and heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2958.345s">So</a> with all due respect to that gentleman, I don't know what to say to you because I would have never walked away from a podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2967.29s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=4836.932s">The</a> unfortunate part about all of this is the council's asking the questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=4839.814s">There's</a> no one here from the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=4841.395s">There's</a> no one here from the Office of Community Development. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=4843.577s">And</a> if they are, would they please stand up? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=4846.099s">This</a> is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=4847.099s">And</a> that's the part that I think is a little bit disturbing right now, because this information, whether it be for public safety, whether it be for the bus routes, whether it be for the parking, or just the fact that I have a telephone number to call, this meeting didn't happen overnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=4859.489s">Thank</a> you for your point of information, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=4860.95s">This</a> meeting was pointed out. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=4861.91s">Councilor,</a> can I just ask one more thing, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=4865.368s">You</a> made his point of information console Sir Councilor yes, you asked for point of information And I would appreciate it and I think would have been appreciated by anyone who watching would have had either the number Officer community development or somebody here from the city administration That's how important I believe this issue is. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=4890.752s">Thank</a> you console console longer current are you through?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5128.605s">I</a> believe there was some questions asked by the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5130.325s">Can</a> we move that we get an update on this bridge process on a monthly basis? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5135.187s">And</a> can we have a phone number that we would be able to have in a project person as a contact person? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5140.978s">So</a> if anyone were to call us or the city clerk or any citizen, um, and they can't get ahold of anybody because they close here at 12 o'clock on a Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5148.806s">So</a> for the weekend when it's closed, if they want to call a Councilor on the weekend, and if emergency happens, they can give any one of us a call. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5155.353s">So</a> the number will be made available. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5156.914s">I</a> think that's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5157.755s">Mr.</a> President on that motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5168.749s">A</a> monthly update, the phone number, and the location of where the office is going to be, and the contact person.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5511.441s">I'd</a> like to thank Councilor Caraviello for bringing this up because when he discussed this last week, I don't think anybody really knew the magnitude of the impact that this could have on neighborhoods, and especially if you're abutting this particular situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5524.645s">And</a> through his follow-through with the community of Plymouth, I think he just highlights the fact that sometimes, unfortunately, when pieces of legislation are written and they're enacted, one little word can just change the whole agenda of what somebody might have to offer and what they want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5541.59s">I</a> want to thank you, Councilor Caraviello, for going forward with this, because I think what it does, I think it's a safeguard into our community, into our neighborhoods, into the little children who might have to be exposed to this, because this is an enterprise that's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5553.712s">This</a> is a scandalous for-profit enterprise by people who have no care about our community and the concept of morals that our community should have. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5564.037s">So</a> with that being said, and I know our city solicitor is here, I'm quite sure you're going to be looking into it, and I'm quite sure that we can come up with something.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5575.182s">It's</a> a residential.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5585.984s">And</a> the sad part about this, as we're talking about it, the one that's on Central Ave, if you were to drive by, the windows are all covered. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5593.005s">You'd</a> have no idea what the heck's going on over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5595.986s">And</a> some of the individuals inside, some of the people that are running it may not be that nice to you if you were to ask them questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5602.907s">Why,</a> and what are you doing, and what are you asking questions for, why are you taking pictures, and whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5607.288s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5607.768s">This</a> is a good move. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5609.069s">This</a> is what you call a good neighborhood protection move. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5611.545s">It's</a> a good public health and public safety move between our chief of police and our city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5616.309s">I'm</a> quite sure that we can manage, as plummeters manage, to write something that, unfortunately, until the state decides to change its law and its state statute, we can do it here in our local community. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5626.136s">So,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=7068.678s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=7069.858s">You</a> made a comment about next to Bistro 5, you could put a strip joint. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=7073.132s">City</a> of Medford has what they call an entertainment zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=7075.214s">There's</a> only one spot in the city and that's on the end of Mystic Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=7078.117s">That's</a> the only place that something like that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8289.328s">I</a> think Mr. Sincardi asked the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8292.595s">There's</a> only there's two ways you can record yourself here in the city as a corporation or What was the second one? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8302.78s">But</a> if you get a business certificate it has to have an address on it and has to give you the name of the person Okay, so apparently our index at City Hall does not go by name It doesn't go by it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8313.285s">Can</a> it go either way by name or address?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8327.652s">No,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8328.773s">I</a> think what he's saying Eddie is the fact that is there any record that shows that somebody either is a business operating or.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8343.602s">It's</a> not the type. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8344.423s">It's</a> the name of the business and the street location. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8346.684s">So</a> if you don't, if you can't get it out by the name of the business, can you go by, if you went into our office right now, could you put up a two, uh, what's the name? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8354.888s">What's</a> the address over there? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8355.929s">Well,</a> it's, it's 34 Riverside and your business and your business thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8361.452s">Would</a> it come up? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8362.532s">Can</a> you get something come up on your computer?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8382.945s">And</a> do they have a name on, do they have anything at that address?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8390.987s">No,</a> the owner, that's not the owner of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8392.447s">That's</a> the renter of the rent, right?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8413.792s">Then</a> the question is, is there a city solicitor? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8415.473s">Is</a> he still here? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8416.194s">Mr.</a> Mark. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8422.659s">I</a> know you came in after the fact, but we went through with the chamber some years ago, painstaking to change all these ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8429.721s">The</a> covering of the window, 40% was max.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8434.043s">The</a> sign ordinance, excuse me, 40% was max. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8435.664s">I</a> don't know if you've been down there, but this is completely sprayed. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8439.125s">You</a> cannot see nothing on this one here in Central Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8442.527s">Is</a> that in and of itself enough of a public safety issue and a violation of our municipal law?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8797.825s">No,</a> I just agree with Mr. Sincarly because I've been over there to see and I saw it in Medford Square and I don't understand where the state legislators are on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8808.728s">I</a> can't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8810.068s">This</a> is something that would take it out of their bailiwick and they wouldn't have to worry about it as a state piece of law. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8814.369s">It'll</a> come back to the local community and the local community. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8816.729s">would</a> make its decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8817.969s">You're</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8818.329s">And</a> then it would be on the back of every one of the seven councils or nine or 11, depending on what the form of government might be and the legislative body might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8824.751s">I</a> mean, this has no redeeming social, economic, financial, no value at all to any community for whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8831.973s">This</a> is not Las Vegas if you want to go out there and engage in this type of business and pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8836.614s">So</a> with that being said, I think the council is quite uniform on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8841.735s">I</a> think the council should send a vote to our state senators. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8844.866s">and</a> our three representatives that are part here of the city of Medford, and ask them to file a bill, take a leadership position on it, file a bill to eliminate this particular clause that's in the state law, and for whatever the terminology might be, just bring it back here to local control, and maybe whoever the other gentleman was that came up here and talked about changing our zoning ordinance, maybe we need to take a look and revise the wording in our zoning ordinance that not only addresses this, or any other type-like businesses that might appear in the future, because they may take the word Asian out, and may call it international, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8874.745s">Who</a> knows what it could be? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8875.906s">And</a> if they do that, they beat around the law, and they don't have to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8879.329s">So</a> I think this is one issue that completely belongs in the control of the local community. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8884.113s">And</a> you can't say it any other way. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8887.055s">That's</a> where my vote would go. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8890.999s">Move</a> approval, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8892.22s">Roll</a> call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8892.88s">Have</a> it forwarded to our state senator and our three state reps. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8895.562s">I</a> move the motion to make a motion by Councilor Gabriello, as amended by Councilor Penta,
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10211.297s">Councilor</a> Pente. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10213.038s">A</a> few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10214.519s">Louise,</a> one of the things that we had asked for was our electrical department. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10219.112s">that</a> the superintendent wise, um, contact national grid to address the lack of lighting at Wentworth street rotary. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10225.596s">The</a> response is that the lack of lighting is due to the removal of one street light for construction reasons and will be reinstalled. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10233.281s">The</a> other answer was one street light was struck by a truck and has been struck on more than one occasion. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10237.964s">National</a> grid is evaluating, evaluating whether or not to reinstall due to this location. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10243.527s">Now,</a> have you ever gone to Wentworth circle at nighttime?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10247.75s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10248.711s">Well,</a> if you go there at nighttime, you think you're in the woods, because there's absolutely no lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10253.775s">It's</a> as dark as can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10255.837s">It's</a> a huge public safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10258.559s">We</a> had asked Mr. Randazzo for whatever it takes to put additional lighting in there while this whole construction is going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10266.085s">Now,</a> I know that they're repaving part of the street in Winthrop Street, but they're still working over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10271.429s">And</a> to have National Grid tell us that they're going to evaluate whether, in fact, they're going to put a new light up, that doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10278.632s">And</a> that's the type of an answer I would have not responded to by saying that. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10283.396s">I</a> would have went out of my way to make sure national grid did put the light up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10286.618s">It's</a> a public safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10288.139s">It's</a> a huge factor over there and that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10292.843s">Also,</a> there's some concerns that I had in this budget from four particular departments, engineering, the library, the building and the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10300.329s">And</a> I think we were all educated, at least I was immensely during this past budgetary process, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10305.208s">that</a> these four departments in particular, when asked about their wish list, for which we've been asking each and every year, well, judges knew, as you're aware now, they were all very enlightening to turn around and tell us that they did ask for certain things. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10320.311s">The</a> engineering department in particular, when the engineering director was asked what her wish list was, and she had been asking for this for four years, and how was it done, two times it was verbal, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10334.864s">And</a> two times it was in an email, and she was told by her predecessor not to include it in the budget, because you weren't going to get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10342.986s">Well,</a> how do you deny having four people use one telephone call, one telephone? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10348.727s">How</a> do you deny giving them an extra table to work on, file cabinets, and a computerization system to bring them up to date, or at least to keep them up to date, for a $30,000 to a $40,000 hit? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10358.249s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10361.757s">Paul</a> Mulkey from the building department, when he came up, he was asking for something very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10365.579s">He</a> wanted to become modernized and more computerized. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10369.142s">And</a> that was costing him maybe $30,000 to $40,000, asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10371.423s">Is</a> the chief still here? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10375.626s">I</a> don't want to put him on the spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10376.767s">But</a> the question was asked of the chief relative to his wish list. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10380.409s">He</a> had never been asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10381.79s">And</a> when it was asked of you on the night of the budget, you indicated that you had just heard it that morning from the chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10388.814s">And</a> here is the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10390.258s">that</a> has cars and a building and a whole gamut of issues still not being addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10399.364s">The</a> library, for four years, the poor librarian, and including myself, have been all over him because he's not putting these things into the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10407.689s">And</a> it took a cast of characters from our community to say that they wanted that library fixed and they wanted their recertification to come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10419.256s">And</a> what had happened? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10420.937s">When</a> Mr. Bryan was there, he was told not to say anything and not to put in his library by your predecessor. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10429.301s">For</a> six years, we went without being certified. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10431.743s">We</a> kept getting these variances and these special privileges from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10435.845s">That,</a> to me, did not represent what a true budget is all about, because that $225,000, $30,000, or whatever it should have been, should have been part of the daily operating budget that that department needs to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10448.211s">And</a> then lastly, I think the question was asked to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10450.806s">And</a> I don't think I was the one that asked the question, but I believe the question was asked to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10455.329s">Would</a> you have presented the budget the same way you got it to be presented? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10459.913s">And</a> you said no, you would have presented it different. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10462.495s">Because</a> I think you heard about our wish list, a page that had about expensive, a page about salaries, and a page about the whole operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10471.302s">To</a> me, that spoke volumes. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10473.403s">Taking</a> a quick look over to the school department, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10477.948s">whether</a> Roy wants to agree with me or not, for whatever it might be, we had a conversation about the Curtis Tufts School. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10484.589s">Now,</a> the Curtis Tufts School, to some degree, has been a little bit of a bone of contention. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10489.03s">But</a> our own superintendent at that meeting indicated they had to make some changes because it wasn't going in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10494.971s">You</a> can correct me if the words are wrong, but I think that's what you said. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10497.992s">It</a> wasn't going in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10499.532s">So</a> you had to bring in somebody new. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10501.352s">That's</a> okay for 19 kids that are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10504.193s">I</a> believe between 11 administrators and teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10507.334s">But</a> you reward the fellow that's been there for 32 years with a $97,000 brand new job up at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10514.178s">To</a> me, that's not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10515.419s">I</a> don't think that's fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10516.32s">That's</a> $97,000 that could have gone toward education, to a teacher, to books, to materials that teachers probably need. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10523.945s">Maybe</a> you have a difference of opinion with the superintendent, but I wouldn't have done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10527.767s">I</a> look at it an entirely different way. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10529.929s">I</a> also look at the fact that when these new school buildings were built, there was a 5% annual <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10537.114s">supposed</a> to be in there for each particular budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10539.135s">Now,</a> Councilor Caraviello, I believe it was three years ago going into his first year, produced a document, not from him, but the school department that showed $1,203,000 of repairs that were needed in that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10554.159s">The</a> reason why the schools got themselves in trouble in the first place was because they never kept maintenance up. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10559.921s">And</a> at the rate we're going, we're going to find ourselves in the same situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10563.762s">All</a> I ask for each school, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10565.492s">to</a> be broken down individually to have a 5% inclusion of each school rather than all the schools together and try to figure out how this thing is going to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10575.739s">And</a> the other part for which I, again, disagree with my superintendent, and I consider him to be my friend, but we have a difference of opinion, I just think the entrance to Medford High School does not present itself very good for an educational purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10589.549s">If</a> I'm bringing my child up there from the eighth grade going into the ninth, and I look at that front entrance of that building, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10595.07s">And</a> I'm not going to accept the fact that it was a poor winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10597.992s">It's</a> been like that for a while, with bricks that are broken, door handles that are off the thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10603.515s">And</a> you walk into the, it's not very welcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10606.517s">Medford</a> High has a huge talent pool of students and teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10611.62s">It</a> gives a good education to the people in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10614.962s">But</a> of all the schools that Medford has, that high school gets the bad rap for its appearance. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10621.206s">And</a> as we all know, an appearance can tell a huge story. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10625.657s">I</a> just don't think right now, the way this budget's been presented, and knowing and seeing these department heads tell their particular stories, I don't feel that we're really getting what you call an accurate budget, especially since we just went two weeks ago to have over $1,200,000 in transfers from one department to another. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10643.727s">Are</a> some transfers needed? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10644.967s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10645.548s">No</a> question about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10647.109s">But</a> when one, two, three, four, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10649.974s">five</a> department heads come in there and tell you that they couldn't put in their budget what they really wanted so we as Councilors could understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10657.376s">Maybe</a> we wouldn't have accepted any of them, but all we've asked for for the past many years is show us what your wish list is, tell us how much it's going to cost, and maybe explain to us how you think we can fund it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10669.159s">But</a> when your predecessor tells them not to put it in there and they don't put it in there, that to me is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10675.821s">And</a> because of that, I'm having a hard time right now telling you <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10679.53s">You</a> know, Louise, whether I'm going to vote for this budget tonight or not, because I don't think it reflects an accurate presentation of what department heads need. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10686.675s">I</a> don't see anything coming back here that says the electrical department's going to get its $40,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10692.52s">So</a> every single employee has its own phone rather than one phone for four people, and a table to work on, and a file cabinet to store things. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10700.906s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10701.266s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10702.507s">I</a> don't see anything in the electrical department that makes me feel satisfied that that one circle is going to be safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10708.165s">All</a> I'm getting is a report back that somebody's accepting somebody else's opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10712.846s">Well,</a> that opinion isn't good enough for me when public safety is at issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10716.566s">When</a> I hear a librarian tell me that for four years he's been stifled from putting in what he wants, and you hear the people from this community who brought the charge back, which forced Amir to automatically, mysteriously find $250,000 from a construction job, when we're sitting on $6.5 million in free cash, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10737.58s">I</a> have a problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10739.46s">And</a> when Paul Moki from the building department tells me all he needs is about 30, 40,000 to upgrade his department to computerize it, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10746.882s">But</a> we didn't hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10748.042s">And</a> when I hear our chief of police tell me as of the morning of the date of the budget, that's the first time you and prior to you, your predecessor never had the opportunity or being invited to talk about these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10759.905s">That's</a> bothers me because I think a lot of the times through the past, this council was led to believe, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10764.914s">When</a> the budget was presented, okay, all the department heads agreed upon it, and maybe we should have asked more detailed questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10772.297s">But</a> this year's budget was very enlightening. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10774.738s">So</a> enlightening to the point that I honestly feel that what you were given for a budget to serve is not a true and honest and accurate budget, because if you're transferring a million dollars at the end of the year, as we've had for so many years in the past, and you just keep adding to your free cash, there is something wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10792.275s">I'm</a> not worried about the bond rating of our community right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10795.696s">What</a> I'm worried about is how the taxpayers are going to be continuously taxed and taxed and taxed. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10802.438s">And</a> I'll just leave you with this one thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10804.598s">We</a> have so much development taking place in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10807.639s">We</a> were told that when in Wellington Circle, when stations landing in there, that was going to be such a boom to the city of Medford and to the taxpayers of this community, we would probably not be looking at a tax rate increase maybe for a few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10821.634s">We've</a> had so much development since then, and again, we are taxed and taxed, increase, increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10828.138s">So</a> maybe development for the sake of development is not working in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10832.701s">Public</a> safety, public works, public accommodations, plowing, all municipal services being put on the backs of the taxpayers to accommodate all this development and their taxes are not going down. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10846.03s">So</a> I thank you for taking on your new role. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10849.632s">I</a> know it was thrust upon you. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10851.874s">But</a> unfortunately, I can't buy what's in front of me right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10855.555s">That's</a> just my opinion.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11944.685s">Councilor</a> Penter. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11947.087s">A</a> couple of things pop out. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11949.689s">The</a> issue on the kiosks in the square, citations have gone up. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11954.413s">They</a> haven't gone down. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11955.233s">January</a> was 590, February was 1,800, March was 2,393, April was 2,689. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11957.135s">Just</a> in the month of May, it went down by some 300 citations, but they're still issuing over 2,000 of those a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11971.652s">That's</a> an awful lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11972.673s">It's</a> an awful lot of citations. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11974.734s">And</a> as the chief has indicated, and I believe in his report back to us, that some 400 of the 1,100 citations that were appealed were either reduced or they were abated to some degree. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11988.782s">This</a> kiosk program, as we all know, has been a handicap, in my opinion, to businesses throughout the community as it relates to not being business friendly, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12001.507s">when</a> in fact we could have engaged in a revenue, I mean, strike that, a traffic enforcement program rather than a revenue enhancement program. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12010.029s">I</a> hear what some of my colleagues are saying, but the hard part about supporting a budget like this is the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12018.791s">Louise,</a> you were there because you presented this budget and worked on it with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12025.612s">Is</a> there any reason why in the electrical department for their $40,000 that they were looking for, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12032.135s">not</a> to strike the electrical engineering, the building department probably almost around the same amount, at least the police department, even if he got a couple or two or three cruises, you had a fight for the $5,000 and the Council of Aging budget, you had a fight to get the $227,000, and you added on to make it $250,000 for the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12052.903s">Is</a> there any reason, since you knew that these were concerns from the Council, and before this came back tonight, that you couldn't have come back <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12060.471s">and</a> added this in the budget, and some shape me in a reform, because the budget did increase by $4,800,000 from last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12066.875s">This</a> is almost two years in a row that this budget's increased by approximately $5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12071.617s">So</a> an increase in the budget by $5 million are close to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12074.819s">You're</a> maxing out 2.5% to the max. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12078.722s">And</a> as Councilor Marks just alluded to, what you're doing is, well, we don't want to see this next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12085.365s">But</a> I've heard that rhetoric before about not seeing it next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12088.528s">I'm</a> seeing it here right now for the first year. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12091.989s">And</a> this is not to put it on you, because this is what was handed to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12096.151s">But</a> if one, two, three, four, if five department heads are all saying the same thing, and even if you increased each one of these departments by $30,000 each, that's what, $150,000 that you can't find in the budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12108.835s">When,</a> in fact, you just transferred over $1,200,000 at the end of the year? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12119.231s">I</a> just don't buy into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12121.112s">And</a> just what's happened, unfortunately, with the kiosks and the business people in the community and the last horror show of a lady yesterday with the kiosks and the machine and being yelled at when she went to Park Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12136.475s">And</a> tonight, getting a report back from someone who had to wait two months to get his appeal answered, when I thought the appeal was taking place in this building and Park Medford is still doing the appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12148.029s">I</a> don't know how this works, Chief, but if Park Medford is doing the appeals, when we were told it was being done in this building, there's still something wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12156.672s">I</a> just don't think I'm going to vote for this budget, because to me, it does not represent a budget that represents the quality of life that the people of this community need. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12165.596s">That's</a> just my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12167.037s">I</a> think I'm going to stick to it, because, like I said, this has been very insightful to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12175.603s">to</a> talk to you and tell you things that we never heard before, that bothers me. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12180.547s">It</a> bothers me. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12181.307s">And</a> it should bother you, too.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12289.05s">But</a> in all fairness to you coming on late in the process, had these wish list issues been discussed? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12295.432s">Now,</a> you just got through saying in the building department, you needed more info. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12299.333s">So</a> if this was brought up in February, which I believe is when the building department, why would the questions asked then of him? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12306.095s">Why</a> should he have to come up with it? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12308.375s">If</a> he's telling you what he'd like to have, then isn't that what the budget director does or an assistant to the budget director going into the engineering department? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12316.878s">She's</a> been asking for this for four years.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12335.931s">But</a> when all these department heads indicated that they made the request and they were told not to include it and not to talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12342.375s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12343.596s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuso.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12378.859s">Louise,</a> on the library issue of getting ourselves certified, for the last six years we've been getting waivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12385.304s">If</a> the money had been included in the budget not to get away, it's good for the first, second year, okay, maybe there was a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12390.989s">But</a> why wasn't the $225, whatever the appropriate dollar amount, included in the budget as part of its operating cost of doing business in the budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12400.216s">Why</a> did it have to be a group of concerned citizens coming forward that finally put the pressure, and with the help of the council, put the pressure to make sure <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12409.028s">They</a> got their money, their certification, and they got more employees, and more of an upgrading in the building.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12431.047s">But</a> that's the whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12432.068s">I</a> mean, if we're supposed to be operating according to laws or rules and regulations, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12438.052s">We</a> shouldn't be looking for a waiver each and every year and just go on a wing and a prayer, because eventually it's going to come to an end. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12445.036s">A</a> true, actual, factual operating cost of that library is its recertification, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12452.2s">Not</a> depending upon a waiver. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12454.422s">And</a> not to have a department head be worried about saying anything, because he's going to get in trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12459.745s">That</a> to me is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12461.586s">And</a> I think you know it's wrong, too.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13160.108s">Quick</a> point. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13162.908s">Well,</a> I do, you know, but Councilor Longo just enlightened me about something. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13168.17s">Roy,</a> are you here? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13168.81s">Are</a> you still here? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13170.988s">Quick</a> question for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13172.99s">These</a> are the lowest people on the totem pole, and they haven't had a raise in over eight years, the lunch mothers. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13179.335s">You</a> said you were going to check into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13181.117s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13214.44s">Louise,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13216.001s">I</a> want to ask a question to Louise. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13218.703s">Because</a> I didn't find it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13222.406s">I</a> just went through everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13225.561s">Is</a> there going to be increase in the water and sewer rate? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13228.142s">And</a> I believe you didn't have an answer for us and I haven't received an answer from anybody.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13240.969s">Last</a> year at this time, when we discussed our budget, there was an $800,000 additional monies in the budget to pay for the increase from the MWRA water and sewer rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13251.795s">So</a> are you saying now that the city,
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13355.921s">So</a> you're saying that the water rate, I want to get this straight, that the water rate in the budget that's projected to pay the MWRA is the same? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13362.805s">The</a> sewer is being reduced? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13366.961s">by</a> $117,000?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13380.124s">OK,</a> wait a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13381.024s">But</a> you also said the sewer portion has been reduced by $117,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13383.365s">That</a> is correct, from the MWRA. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13385.506s">So</a> it's not the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13386.326s">So</a> the water is the same, but the sewer is $117,000 less than what's in this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13392.687s">That</a> is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13393.447s">OK?</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13394.368s">So</a> as we speak right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13396.347s">According</a> to this budget, if it's passed, there's $117,000 that we haven't been apprised on because we're voting on a budget that's going to have a dollar amount that's $117,000 more than what you're saying right now.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13412.358s">So</a> right now, then that's an inaccurate budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13414.66s">The</a> total amount is inaccurate by $117,000 because you just got saying it was reduced.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13440.758s">The</a> vote of the Council has only been predicated on last year, for example, of the rate increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13445.941s">We</a> right now are voting on this water and sewer portion of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13449.972s">not</a> knowing what the fee is even going to be, if there's going to be an increase or a decrease. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13453.694s">So</a> that would mean you're going to have to come back at another time if there's going to be an increase, because the Water and Soil Commission don't set the rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13463.26s">They're</a> only giving you the dollar amount what's necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13465.702s">So</a> even with your $117,000 reduction here, if the city decides, after reviewing its consumption and its getting rid of the water, there's going to be a $300,000 increase to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13479.514s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13479.634s">You're</a> all going to have to come back to the council and ask this council, whatever the dollar amount might be, for an increase.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13515.319s">So</a> now let's just say it doesn't cover it and you need more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13519.482s">You're</a> going to then have to come back to the council.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13522.244s">And</a> right now we're sitting on $7.5 million of surplus money in the water and sewer enterprise account. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13529.43s">That</a> is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13529.931s">Council</a> can still choose to recommend that that money, whatever the increase comes out of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13536.417s">I</a> would move, Mr. President, that the budget as presented with the dollar amount attached be reduced by $117,000.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13622.254s">So</a> on the motion for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13627.496s">Did</a> you or did you not just say that the sewer portion is being reduced by $117,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13631.358s">You</a> just said it from there, correct?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13637.4s">And</a> that would be $117,000 less than what was given to us in that budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13641.462s">That</a> is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13642.499s">So</a> the dollar amount the budget is coming forward with needs to be reduced by $117,000 to accurately reflect the water and sewer in this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13652.126s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13652.727s">The</a> sewer portion only. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13654.228s">Yes,</a> the sewer portion. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13655.869s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13657.19s">Motion</a> to sever.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13670.36s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13671.501s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13673.138s">We're</a> not cutting the line items. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13674.499s">I</a> believe the budget director just indicated, and again, she can correct me if I'm wrong, that you just got these figures now, correct?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13682.923s">And</a> the dollar amount in this book that represents the budget is now $117,000 less, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13687.705s">That</a> is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13690.066s">And</a> for this budget to be accurate with its numbers as presented now with the 117 before this vote, this total dollar amount of the budget of $150 million needs to be reduced by $117,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13703.027s">Is</a> that correct, Louise?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13704.848s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13705.708s">It</a> needs to be reduced.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13715.512s">That</a> dollar needs to be deducted from the total.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14456.942s">The</a> 117,000 that represents the actual numbers of the budget presented.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14475.626s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14475.906s">Miller</a> just got through telling us that she just got today, for which none of us knew about this, $117,000 is a number less than what's in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14485.073s">So</a> to have these numbers to be accurate as presented, it needs to be deducted by $117,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14489.317s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14489.437s">Take</a> the vote.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14571.753s">Wait</a> a minute, wait a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14573.434s">It</a> can't be an amendment because the amendment lost.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14708.081s">We</a> just got this. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14709.542s">We</a> just got this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14710.743s">We</a> just got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14711.644s">Yeah,</a> so how can you vote for approval if you just got it? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14714.246s">We</a> didn't get it just tonight.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14724.147s">We</a> just got this tonight.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14728.55s">Just</a> got it now, handed it on my desk tonight.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14746.182s">On</a> the motion, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14750.144s">I</a> think it would be beneficial if you reviewed it to the public so they'd have an idea of what this prevention coordinator is going to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14757.77s">It's</a> been long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14759.191s">People</a> have been waiting for this, so I think you can hit the highlights of it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14857.088s">Job</a> or salary?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14868.634s">So</a> it was in the sixties.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14871.495s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14872.435s">Could</a> you just read at the end, um, the physical requirements?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14897.9s">Yeah,</a> only for one reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14899.362s">The</a> one thing I'm, it doesn't talk about driving to a destination. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14903.625s">And</a> I'm just wondering, is this particular job going to just be completely in-house or is this job going to allow somebody to go to a different location or
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14961.827s">Move</a> the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14962.667s">And</a> I want to thank you for passing this up tonight, because this is the first time I see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14966.089s">Chief,</a> I'd just like to ask you one question in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14967.87s">It</a> makes reference to the police department.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14992.261s">Chief,</a> do you have a copy of this or not?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14996.683s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14997.443s">It's</a> section over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14998.144s">It</a> says develop jointly with the police, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15000.714s">Programming</a> to decriminalize and foster relationship with those with substance abuse disorders and their families using evidence based upon principles and practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15009.416s">Support</a> police on programming and any grant activities related to substance abuse. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15014.477s">What</a> was your interaction with this for this to be included? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15019.739s">In</a> this program.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15049.456s">So</a> for the purposes of this position, are you going to oversee <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15054.898s">these</a> particular police officers who might be designated? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15057.799s">How</a> is this going to work?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15237.262s">How</a> long does it take to advertise? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15240.245s">Was</a> it three weeks, ma'am? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15241.185s">After</a> the third reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15244.908s">After</a> the first reading.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15248.991s">So</a> it can be advertised.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15317.645s">Eddie,</a> you're saying you have the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15320.006s">You're</a> saying you're putting this in a classification program, but just the case, just the headline are all these words. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15326.828s">The</a> headline we had, we don't even understand this.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15414.92s">But</a> we're talking about the classification, not this description, correct?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15424.445s">Can</a> this be added or subtracted to it? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15426.805s">We're</a> going to vote for the classification, but can recommendations be added or subtracted to this?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15462.143s">Roll</a> call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15463.023s">For</a> the classification. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15464.404s">Marks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15465.045s">For</a> this to be classified in the city's compensation plan.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15473.47s">We</a> don't have anything.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15482.437s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15848.802s">Question,</a> Mark.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15850.083s">Quick</a> question. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15851.924s">Are</a> we as a city advocating that we want these things, or can somebody just come in here and set themselves up?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16084.047s">This</a> is almost like a preemptive strike for what we were talking about earlier with the folks about these massage parlors or whatever you want to call it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16090.751s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16091.171s">You</a> know, we're preparing for it, and I would hope <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16095.865s">When</a> you get this information, the same energy will go forward so that we can come up with an ordinance that basically we don't have to deal with folks in residential neighborhoods, unfortunately, that won't have the same luxury as something like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16109.134s">So</a> with that being said, I've got no problem having us go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16112.936s">But</a> my only other question is, you suggested that they could maybe come in under the term horticultural.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16136.506s">But</a> when you say the word cultivation, is that going to mean growing? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16139.188s">Yes,</a> it does. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16139.729s">Having</a> a hothouse and all of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16141.19s">Yes,</a> it does.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16255.207s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16255.648s">On</a> that particular motion, number one, we talk about local access. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16261.171s">It's</a> got some access alluded to. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16262.532s">You're</a> looking at a location that's centrally located. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16265.894s">Medford</a> high school is not centrally located. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16268.836s">And</a> from my most recent talking and understanding, I believe that the whole project is on hold right now because they don't have a, they don't have anyone that, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16276.997s">submitted</a> a bid that would be acceptable to the city.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16294.904s">Mr.</a> President, from the information that I've been able to ascertain, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16299.16s">It's</a> on hold, number one, for the time being, because I don't believe that they had more than one developer who made a request to go up there, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16306.503s">We're</a> not talking about the architect. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16308.764s">We're</a> talking about the tax-exempt non-profit that would be making the bid on the program.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16319.548s">Mr.</a> President, the tax-exempt non-profit, I believe that they only had one bidder at the present time, but that's not the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16325.65s">The</a> fact of the matter is simply this. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16327.351s">It's</a> not centrally located. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16328.821s">It's</a> not a place where somebody can go and take a bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16331.062s">It's</a> not a place where you would want to send an adult at nighttime to have them traverse up there and walk an extension part of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16340.028s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16340.709s">Number</a> two, the fact of the matter is, if it would be in a centrally located place, it would be easily accessible to not only students, but professional people. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16349.834s">And</a> those folks would want to be educated and have the high school become the satellite to the central location somewhere in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16356.979s">We've</a> talked about two locations possibly. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16359.235s">One</a> at Cheviro Auditorium, the other one, as Councilor Caraviello alluded to, at the public library. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16363.958s">A</a> great opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16365.259s">The</a> city is sitting on over $350,000 of that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16368.521s">But</a> the real fact of the matter is this, there is no public access operating right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16372.403s">Whether</a> you're a council running for office, whether you're running here for re-election, for whatever it might be, the mayor is intentionally stifling public access by not having it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16381.072s">And</a> at the present time, that is absolutely not fair because each and every rate payer on every single month in their bill, Verizon and Comcast, is being charged for public access for which they're not getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16391.657s">It's</a> going to take some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16393.098s">If</a> you read the report that the three-member commission that the mayor empowered in February this past year talked about it being centrally located, easily accessible for people to get to, and to be educationally and technologically available to students and for business people and for residents and for taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16409.416s">We</a> had six people come here on a particular night and talk about the value of what public access could be if, in fact, it was an operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16416.338s">But</a> it isn't an operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16417.838s">And</a> this administration, unfortunately, has not only fallen asleep on this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16422.62s">When</a> you had the public access here in June, the public meeting on the 10-year contract with Comcast, not one person from the city administration was here to talk about, never mind public access, but to defend the ratepayers of this community for being charged for something. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16436.123s">Where</a> do you have it? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16436.683s">Two</a> o'clock in the afternoon when people are working. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16439.187s">That's</a> not the time to have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16440.548s">That's</a> not being open and communicative. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16442.53s">And</a> what does the city hire? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16443.831s">They</a> hire an outside attorney, pay him $350 an hour to sit here and take notes for the 10, 12 people who came and spoke on that particular day. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16450.996s">I</a> spoke on that day because I think public access, and more importantly, our cable access bill is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16456.861s">And</a> to have a 10-year contract go out with the lack of amount of public interest and input, that is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16462.505s">That's</a> wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16463.405s">And</a> that's what public access is about, having somebody have the opportunity to come up, whether you agree or disagree, to express their opinions. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16469.907s">That's</a> what we don't have here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16471.967s">Not</a> worried about what's going to go up in the high school, that's so far out into the future, way beyond an election coming forward, way beyond whether we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16480.009s">July</a> 3rd is right around the corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16482.23s">This</a> mayor has up until July 3rd to make his decision whether he's going to sign another 10-year contract with Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16488.954s">And</a> he was asked on that particular day, not only by myself, but other people, not to sign it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16493.796s">The</a> same way that the mayor is not going to hire a new director of public works until the new mayor comes in in January of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16499.699s">Well,</a> he should be doing the same thing as it relates to Comcast and to find out where we're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16504.542s">The</a> contracts now that are being extended go anywheres no more from three to five years max. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16509.864s">And</a> after the third year, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16511.155s">There's</a> supposed to be community input. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16512.315s">There's</a> supposed to be a community survey, for which never took place, as to what do you think about Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16517.456s">You</a> know, the aliquot and the specialty programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16520.137s">None</a> of that has taken place, for which if you read the contract, it was supposed to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16524.077s">And</a> if you read the guidelines from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Department of Public Utilities say those are the ingredients that are necessary in each and every one of contract renewals. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16532.779s">This</a> city did not follow any of the guidelines, none of the renewal quotes, and as it relates to that, and as a result, that's why we don't have public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16540.45s">Because</a> if this mayor was so interested in having public access, he could plaster himself all over it, like he does in Channel 15, and let everybody have an opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16549.575s">It's</a> not his station. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16551.135s">It's</a> not Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16552.556s">He</a> doesn't own it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16553.837s">And</a> that's what's wrong.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16572.24s">Mr.</a> President, the reason why, you know, lying is a strange word around here, because I think sometimes the maker of the commentary should review his comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16585.003s">The</a> reason why we wanted to get rid of Channel 3 was because it's despicable actions. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16591.287s">It's</a> a lack of accounting for money. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16593.449s">It's</a> a lack of keeping minutes of records. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16596.051s">It's</a> a lack of allowing people to come and speak, and it's a lack of doing the community work. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16601.214s">And</a> for the people who were running it at the time, their complete abuse and misuse of their 501c3 prerogative, that's what is wrong.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_nGjpg5WePi4/2025-03-21_nGjpg5WePi4.html">Medford City Council - June 23, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1041.286s">Including</a> or concurring with the remarks of Councilor Knight, I think what we need is a report back from our city solicitor that basically addresses the fact that it's a concern here within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1054.637s">And</a> since it's an allowable or <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1056.659s">appearing</a> to be an allowable use according to our zoning, I think what needs to be addressed is maybe addressing the licensure division back in Boston and indicating to them that something like this should come under the authority of the local legislative body rather than a state agency because the effect of the granting of this particular license does affect the community, whether it's abutting a residential, commercial, or what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1080.786s">And</a> with that being said, I would ask that <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1083.975s">if</a> this is what the case needs to be, that our city solicitor provide to us the legalese in writing to support either a recommendation, I don't know, I think it would be a home rule petition, it might be just a waiver of rules and regulations that the Division of Licensure might have at the present time to support local communities, whether they want it or they won't want it, because unfortunately there is no public hearing, there is no public commentary on this, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1112.417s">Councilor</a> Knight just alluded to, they could go anywhere they want because the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is allowing this to their license or division. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1118.339s">So</a> I'm going to move that as an amendment to the resolution to find out just where we can go with this.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1660.198s">I'm</a> glad Councilman Marks brought this up because the interesting component about this is when we had a conversation about this a few months back, I introduced the offering as what they did and I don't have my notes with me right now, so I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1672.5s">But</a> in Florida, they had a particular community where their downtown areas were exactly as Councilman Marks was alluding to. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1679.281s">And</a> what they did is they made offerings to the owners of the property either with tax incentives or employment incentives or community-based incentives. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1688.415s">which</a> would have allowed the owner of the property, whoever he rented out to, to get one of these benefits for the purposes of coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1697.099s">And</a> what they did is they sort of like took a particular street, and what they just did, from A to B to C to D. Now about three weeks ago, I went and I heard the lady who works for the community of Lowell, and she is not the community office director, but she is the director, I believe, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1716.107s">cultural</a> resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1717.448s">And</a> what they did is they took street by street. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1720.771s">And</a> what they did, as Councilor Marks alluded to, they've alluded, they went from one street to the next street and just jumped. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1726.415s">And</a> they just piggybacked all the way around to an entire portion of the town. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1730.698s">Where</a> now, it doesn't happen overnight, but you need to have a beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1733.881s">And</a> that's what the beginning is. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1735.502s">It's</a> unfortunate that this administration does not realize that, didn't take advantage of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1740.306s">We've</a> talked about revitalizing Medford Square three times in the <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1743.495s">past</a> 20 years, and it hasn't happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1746.596s">But</a> what needs to happen is the business people. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1748.936s">And</a> this is a true test now for the Chamber of Commerce to come to life and say, hey, you know, we want good businesses to be here in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1755.458s">We</a> want to be a working partner here with the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1758.339s">And</a> if this is the issue tonight, and it really brings it to head, then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1762.96s">And</a> I think you're right, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1766.261s">I</a> just think this is the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1768.142s">The</a> people really need to know, you know, what their government is doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1770.982s">You</a> know, what is the forecast? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1772.203s">What</a> is the plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1773.293s">you</a> know, what's the open window and the fresh air going to be all about as it relates to where we're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1778.117s">So</a> I support, I support your thoughts and I can assure you that that would be in my plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1783.361s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1993.675s">If</a> anybody were to go to Medford Square and just look at the 5 High Street building that's there now, they've had scaffolding and staging there for well over in excess of three months. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2003.64s">It's</a> an absolute disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2005.041s">It's</a> an eyesore. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2006.222s">It's</a> a public health and it's a public safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2009.265s">This</a> is what I don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2011.426s">How</a> long does it take for something like that to stay there before it causes a real harm and a real problem to the people within this community? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2020.053s">The</a> owner of the property should be held accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2022.695s">It's</a> been like that for three months. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2024.517s">There's</a> no work. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2025.257s">There</a> has been no work that's been done other than putting up the scaffolding. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2029.057s">And</a> nobody knows what the reason is. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2030.938s">It</a> surrounds the entire building. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2032.798s">If</a> surrounding the entire building and the parapet has a problem, well, there's no work that's been done on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2039.061s">I</a> just think it's unfair to every other business person that does what they're supposed to do in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2043.783s">We</a> just had a conversation out tonight of putting a massage parlor on Riverside Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2047.864s">And</a> that's as bad as looking at a parapet because, again, it serves no particular purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2052.606s">It</a> offers no intrinsic value to the community of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2056.147s">It</a> absolutely is an eyesight. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2058.364s">And,</a> as I said, it's a public safety, health, and a building department issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2063.785s">I've</a> seen people walk underneath that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2065.405s">I</a> saw it today — yesterday, when I was walking, a lady with a baby carriage. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2069.006s">And</a> she had to move her baby carriage out from under because, unfortunately, the other lady who was walking down was in a walker. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2075.347s">And,</a> you know, so that was nice of her to do that, but there should have been no reason for her to do that because she had to go out underneath it and then bring herself back in. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2083.348s">So</a> I'm asking, Mr. President, that our building department find out who that owner is immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2088.207s">and</a> find out what the reason is. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2089.607s">And</a> if no work is being done there, then take that scaffolding down because it's serving absolutely no purpose at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2096.609s">And</a> it's just absolutely making Medford Square look exactly what people are saying it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2101.529s">It's</a> a no man's land town. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2103.31s">It</a> offers nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2104.39s">It</a> shows you nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2106.15s">And</a> I don't want that to be an example of what we're offering in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2112.852s">Roll</a> call vote and have that vote to the building commissioner.

<a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3639.638s">Now,</a> why would the mayor have to go back and say he would take it under advisement when we're talking about $5,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3644.44s">It's</a> a surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3647.081s">Why</a> is this even being brought up, point number one, as a discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3650.542s">I</a> don't understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3651.942s">Because</a> again, to transfer a million dollars at the end of the year, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3655.722s">It</a> isn't just this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3656.943s">I</a> mean, this is new to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3657.864s">This</a> is your first year here in the city of Medford, but this seems to have been a generic issue each and every year transfer of all this money of all this money. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3666.67s">And</a> for the first time this year, the department heads have been really been honest and maybe they're coming out of their shell to tell us how they really feel. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3675.377s">Now</a> you've been there to hear it and you will see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3677.298s">And</a> I asked you on every one of the department heads to tell us your wishlist. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3681.201s">This</a> is what this council has asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3683.124s">a</a> wish list of each department head before we get the budget so we could understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3687.406s">And</a> some of them said they never met, and some of them said they did meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3691.428s">And</a> you were honest enough to say in a couple of them, you met with them on the day of the budget hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3696.39s">And</a> you were also honest enough when the question was asked of you, the way the budget was presented, would you present the budget in the same fashion? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3703.233s">And</a> your answer was no. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3704.914s">And</a> I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3706.574s">So</a> taking that and putting that all together and listening to two department heads in particular, engineer, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3712.571s">and</a> the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3713.892s">Both</a> of them had made requests, very simple requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3718.276s">Let's</a> take the engineering office. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3722.659s">Four</a> people using one phone, a desk that all they want upstairs so they could work on it, file cabinets, and an integrated technology system to the computer, a $30,000 hit, and they were told no. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3738.112s">And</a> when the question was asked in the engineering department, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3741.222s">Did</a> you ever present that to the budget director? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3743.063s">Not</a> you, the former budget director. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3744.724s">She</a> said yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3745.744s">And</a> she said how many times? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3747.245s">Four</a> years in a row. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3749.045s">And</a> she just happened to have two of those years with her. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3752.847s">And</a> she was told by the then budget director, no, you could not put it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3757.269s">When</a> the gentleman who was the library director was asked the same question on his wish list, he said for the last four years he had been making this presentation to the budget director. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3767.954s">And</a> she told him, no, you cannot put it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3771.093s">Now,</a> he's a little bit different than her, because he doesn't like confrontation. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3774.794s">And</a> he'll probably tow the line, because he knows that the mayor is his boss. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3779.234s">But</a> I'll compliment the engineer, because she did turn around. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3782.435s">And</a> she was a little bit upset, because you can't run an office with four people using one phone, not have a file cabinet that's acceptable to hold the documents, a working station, and to have some type of computer. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3794.617s">Now,</a> I think when Mr. Moki was here, and he's in charge of the building department, he had asked for something, again, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3800.79s">I</a> think it was $30,000, $40,000, and that's to integrate the entire system so people could jump onto it for the purposes of reviewing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3808.355s">These</a> are the working instruments that these department heads need. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3813.158s">And</a> when you turn around and try to explain to the taxpayer, you have $6.5 million in surplus, and we have $7.5 million, $7.5 million in our water and sewer enterprise account because we're trying to stay financially stable. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3827.567s">Well,</a> I'm going to lead into the <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3829.501s">report,</a> the 2014 report ending by our outside consultant that says the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3836.505s">The</a> city does not have a formal investment policy that limits investment maturities as a means of managing its exposure to fair value losses arising from increasing interest rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3848.892s">Now,</a> we hear all around here that this city is so well maintained in its bond rating and what it goes out to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3855.515s">Now,</a> here's an outside auditing company and says we have no <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3859.21s">formal</a> investment policy to protect us in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3864.213s">So</a> who are we to believe? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3866.354s">The</a> city administration or the outside consultant, Melanson and Heath, who does the audit in that particular part? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3872.918s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3873.958s">We've</a> asked for an update on the parking tickets from Republic in the abatements that have come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3879.522s">We</a> still haven't gotten that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3881.523s">We</a> haven't gotten a report back of whether, in fact, there is going to be a water and sewer rate increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3886.646s">We</a> got a report back from the Water and Sewer Commission <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3889.515s">indicating</a> the amount of usage that's gone up and the amount of usage in their wastewater treatment that's gone up. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3897.6s">We</a> still don't have anything that's definitive that's going to tell us that are we going to get an increase or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3903.903s">Let's</a> go to the fire stations that both Councilor Marks and Councilor Lungo-Koehn has alluded to. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3907.565s">$2</a> million is not chump change. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3912.368s">$2</a> million represents the taxpayers' money being put into buildings <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3916.927s">to</a> make sure that firefighters in the respective houses that they're in have what they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3923.228s">On</a> that particular night, when I believe the gentleman who was the president of the firefighters was here, he indicated he had a difference of opinion with the chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3929.71s">And</a> that's OK, having a difference of opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3932.27s">But</a> the difference of opinion should not have been had there before the council, because if we had this wish list to discuss it, we'd have this opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3939.251s">I</a> don't think the question asked by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3942.817s">should</a> get anybody upset, because that's just good project management. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3946.438s">And</a> since we don't have a clerk of the works, who's going to be the project manager on any of these jobs or all of these jobs once the things go wrong? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3954.441s">We</a> built a new fire station in South Medford, and I think the building didn't even make it through its first year when they had leaks and air conditioning and heating problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3963.464s">And</a> that's a multimillion-dollar building, not a $2 million building. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3967.946s">So</a> my colleagues are right making these questions and asking these questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3971.818s">Because</a> why should we as the tax, strike that, why should we as representatives of the taxpayers have to come back at a later date to say we got a bond for this and we have to bond for that, or we have to pay for this and pay for that, when in fact we really shouldn't have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3985.469s">You</a> know, we just got through building a new public works building, a brand new public works building for approximately $14 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3992.595s">And</a> the reason why the old building fell apart is because the city had no maintenance program for any of its buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3999.635s">The</a> reason why the library got itself in so much trouble is because, A, the library director was denied what he needed for money. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4007.48s">And</a> number two, how could you take for six years in a row and get a waiver to your certification with the state, which is approximately $225,000 per year? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4016.366s">A</a> waiver is only good for maybe one, two years max. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4019.328s">And</a> we were really running the string on that one there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4022.149s">And</a> then to turn around and say, we found the money in some kind of a construction development, and we're going to generate that $225,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4029.784s">That</a> is bull in plain English. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4031.865s">When</a> you're sitting on reserves, cash reserves, that are the taxpayers' money of this community, and you can't put a legitimate budget out, line item by line item, that identifies the actual cost of needs, the required cost of needs, that's not a true budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4048.335s">And</a> I don't think to some degree that this budget that's presented, and it's not your budget that you presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4052.897s">I</a> know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4053.678s">I</a> know you walked into this position late on, and I believe when you were asked the question and you answered it honestly, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4059.197s">You</a> would not be presenting this type of a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4061.298s">It</a> would include the wish list. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4062.899s">It</a> would include cost and expenditures, actuals, and it would have everything broken down. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4068.001s">We</a> shouldn't have to ask now for these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4071.723s">We</a> shouldn't have to ask for revolving accounts for expenditures and revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4077.485s">That</a> should just come automatically. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4079.366s">And</a> boards and commissions, that should have all been presented to us during this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4083.888s">Not,</a> well, maybe next year we'll have a representative from each board. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4086.95s">It</a> shouldn't work that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4088.728s">This</a> is the only time of the year when the taxpayers of this community can actually see their tax dollars at work. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4095.571s">And</a> for us to be put into a position tonight to vote on something with multiple questions still to be answered is wrong and it's unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4103.795s">I'll</a> ask you, Councilor Caraviello, with all due respect, if you would withdraw your vote and allow this to sit on the table for a week so we can answer these questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4113.46s">And</a> then that way, I think we could all be on the same page and we can let our votes fall the way they may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4118.243s">because</a> I think it's just unfair right now, with so many questions that are still lingering, to have a vote with these still outstanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4125.486s">So</a> I ask you, with all due respect.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4945.928s">Louise</a> Miller, could you please come to the podium, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4953.714s">Did</a> you or did you not give us a revised budget this evening, dollar amounts? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4961.0s">It's</a> revised, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4962.382s">It's</a> not the original one that was submitted.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4995.76s">Madam</a> Louise, well, the word says revised right up above. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5000.083s">Revised</a> means it's different.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5041.268s">Wait</a> a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5042.008s">Wait</a> a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5042.469s">Point</a> of Mr. Starello is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5044.411s">Cause</a> the, if you look at the department of local services rules that just were re promulgated in May of 2015, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5052.233s">a</a> local city council or a town council has to vote approval on a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5057.297s">And</a> as a matter of fact, the new rulings, if the city council wants to add to a budget that has not been included in the budget, this time you can add to the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5066.943s">So</a> I think, I think everybody started.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5158.865s">It</a> can't be because you have a revised document that she just talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5163.305s">Why</a> would you vote on an old one when you have a revised one?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5183.878s">Mrs.</a> Milner-Lewis just indicated that she presented a revised document here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5192.08s">How</a> can you vote on something that's been revised?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5296.597s">That's</a> the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5297.337s">I</a> am not going to put myself in this type of a position. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5299.739s">It's</a> absolutely ridiculous.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5693.449s">Sir,</a> could you identify yourself again?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5713.722s">So</a> you're here on behalf of Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5715.783s">You're</a> not here on behalf of the project.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5734.645s">I</a> think in all fairness to the project, and I can appreciate you being here, but you're not the applicant.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5748.486s">Go</a> ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5749.166s">Well,</a> I just don't know if you could even pass on this because he's not the legitimate applicant.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5823.226s">There's</a> a line in here that says National Grid will inform the city of any newly installed duct bank that it determines in the future will not be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5832.57s">as</a> the 105-foot length of duct bank that extends from the building service to the pole. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5838.575s">So</a> the building service to the pole, you're going to have to go over a public sidewalk.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5848.123s">Usually</a> when we get something like this, Madam Chairperson, we get some kind of response back from our city engineer.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5861.968s">It</a> says approved superintendent-wise, but it doesn't say city engineer.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5886.607s">So</a> that's what you people call our city engineer chief engineer?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5893.877s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5895.258s">That's</a> it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5895.999s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5897.319s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5898.88s">I</a> just want to make sure, like I said, you're not the applicant, so if you fill in it, I am.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6119.278s">Quick</a> question. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6120.178s">What</a> did you say? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6120.979s">Is</a> it 121 feet?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6129.176s">And</a> that's on the street.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6131.177s">And</a> how do you intend to repair the street once you dig it up?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6140.084s">Is</a> this in the middle of the street to the left?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6146.409s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6146.949s">Well,</a> if that's the case, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6149.461s">You</a> realize that the city is implementing — going to be implementing a new policy that, six months after that trench, that — you know, the street better be the way it's supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6158.427s">Because</a> many times, when you folks go out there, whoever your contractors are, you know, it sinks.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6166.292s">Huh?</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6167.933s">Well,</a> you try not to, but drive around the city right now and go look at all the trenches you've dug up. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6175.378s">Move</a> approval with that — with that condition now, Madam President, that the city — <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6179.218s">review</a> this subject matter upon completion, six months upon completion.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6702.638s">Where</a> does it face? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6703.439s">I'm</a> sorry? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6705.059s">Where</a> does it face?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6710.122s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6710.982s">Sorry.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7462.736s">Mr.</a> President, why do you want to be open at five o'clock?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7474.655s">Your</a> other Panera stores don't open at this hour?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7513.54s">And</a> what did they say about this?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7519.001s">Well,</a> I got an email tonight from Mr. McLaughlin, and he's opposed to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7522.042s">So</a> I don't know where you're getting your information from.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7528.43s">That's</a> two months ago compared to now. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7530.672s">You</a> understand, as Councilor Marks just alluded to, that mound of dirt has caused a tremendous amount of problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7536.416s">There's</a> a lady who lives across the street.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7547.384s">The</a> fact of the matter is that that mound of dirt has caused a tremendous amount of consternation over there, not only to the <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7552.832s">lady</a> across the street, but it's found itself over the St. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7555.094s">James</a> road and fourth street. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7556.756s">Um,</a> and since all the neighbors are not in agreement of this, and I just can't understand why, you know, you don't have any drive-thrus, it's, it's, it's bad enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7564.625s">It's</a> going to be huge, major congestion over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7567.348s">The</a> neighbors, nobody's, nobody's going to get a benefit out of this except noodles. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7570.871s">And</a> you know, everyone else has to conform to regular hours of operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7574.738s">I</a> don't see any need right now yet for this, so I would not be voting for approval at this time for this.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8098.961s">Yeah,</a> I'm just confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8101.182s">I'm</a> really concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8101.963s">You're</a> telling me you met with the neighbors and they said, okay, and I'm getting emails from them and they're saying no. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8107.928s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8243.197s">I'm</a> council angle. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8245.238s">Kern</a> brings up a good point and I'm, this has got me confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8248.4s">All</a> right, I'm going to tell you that they'll tell you one thing and I'm doing another. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8251.421s">I</a> have no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8252.382s">I'll</a> vote for it, but I want to change it to a three month or six month in the year return three times within the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8258.265s">So</a> let's see. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8260.286s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8260.546s">We'll</a> just review it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8264.048s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8270.011s">That's</a> fair enough, but I'm just saying, you have to understand, you know, when you get phone calls from neighbors and you get emails and it's contrary to what you're telling them.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8279.096s">So</a> I don't know what happened from two months to now to have anyone change their mind if that's what they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8283.798s">But</a> I could go along with a three month, a six month and a year.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8778.245s">Mr.</a> Brady, he retired, I believe, as a lieutenant detective in the Medford Police Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8783.649s">He</a> served many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8786.23s">He</a> was a detective. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8790.773s">And</a> he served this community well. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8792.795s">He</a> worked with the FBI. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8793.755s">He</a> worked with the state police. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8794.776s">He</a> was well recognized for his duty as a Medford police officer in bringing good name and recognition to our community and to his family. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8804.805s">His</a> daughter was a former school committeeman, Hattie Brady. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8808.367s">And</a> to his wife, Mary, and to the rest of the family, I wish them a special, special notice.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8942.83s">Roll</a> call vote, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9302.708s">The</a> question of June, July 3rd on the status of whether the mayor is going to sign a 10 year contract or not, unfortunately, um, I don't think should bode well with the rate payers here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9316.458s">The</a> mayor by design and choice did not pick a new director of public works. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9321.021s">He's</a> leaving that for the next mayor to come on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9323.835s">in</a> January of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9326.396s">That's</a> just an 83,000, or strike that, it's about a $100,000 a year job. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9330.939s">This</a> is a 10-year, multi-year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9334.341s">This</a> is a mega contract that this city will be signing with Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9338.103s">And</a> Comcast, as we all know, this probably has one of the worst reputations for public employment of their employees throughout the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9347.95s">as</a> they're being reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9348.97s">And</a> I think you can just find that out on their public service. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9351.591s">But</a> putting that aside and recognizing the fact that when the public hearing took place here regarding a public access cable in this community, I was the only one that represented, as an elected official, as any administrator, as the mayor, I was the only one that appeared here on behalf of the ratepayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9368.116s">And</a> city government should have been here on behalf of the ratepayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9370.917s">They</a> should have been on behalf here. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9372.518s">And</a> they weren't. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9373.658s">And</a> the sad part about this is whether you sign the 10-year contract or not, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9377.323s">and</a> you get that balloon payment, there's another $300,000 plus sitting downstairs as money that the mayor has held down here in escrow in the city's coffers. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9386.871s">So</a> this goes back to December of 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9388.872s">There's</a> been no cable access here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9392.615s">This</a> is an election year. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9393.596s">This</a> will make two election cycles that the people have been denied an opportunity not only to see and hear their candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9399.761s">I</a> don't care who you're for or who you're against. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9401.752s">But</a> that's what public access is about, plus any other community of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9405.413s">You</a> have sports, you have arts, you have culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9408.174s">There's</a> a whole host of things that community access is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9411.355s">And</a> this administration has intentionally denied that accessibility to take place here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9417.437s">It</a> is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9418.717s">And</a> I think what the gentleman at the podium was trying to say is, Mr. Mayor, you should just allow it, whether it's in a portable situation or make something temporary, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9427.26s">You</a> know, we just went through a three-member committee who made a report. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9431.114s">that</a> came back and, you know, the mayor told him he wanted to come out in February, wanted to report by Memorial Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9437.496s">Memorial</a> Day has come and gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9439.016s">We're</a> almost into the July season here right now, and there is still nothing, whether you agree or disagree with the recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9445.318s">And</a> when the mayor wanted to put it up at the high school in the dead of night, where people would have to go there, where it would be dark and secluded, when the recommendation was to put it in an open downtown area, easily accessible to people, that's a shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9459.687s">But</a> I think it was Councilor Caraviello and I think it was Mr. Viglione who mentioned the ideas of possibly going to Shavia, which is equipped to do it, or to put it in the second floor, or have a complete renovation with the friends of the Miffin Public Library and looking at its future use. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9475.983s">And</a> that's what the discussion was about on the money that went back to the library that the mayor mysteriously found. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9482.468s">This</a> is what it's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9483.629s">This</a> is what community needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9485.37s">They</a> need not only this community access, they need this interaction. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9488.233s">They</a> need this transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9490.034s">They</a> need to know that their money is being spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9492.436s">Who</a> in their right mind would believe that $300,000 of their cable money is sitting downstairs in this building, not getting any use, not even having any program, not even having any public input, not even coming and speaking in behalf of the ratepayers for which he is the issuing authority on.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9535.798s">Could</a> you please repeat what you just said? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9537.279s">Who</a> was the city representative? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9539.02s">The</a> lawyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9540.105s">The</a> lawyer gets paid $330 an hour to be here, to listen, to hear the hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9545.347s">He</a> wasn't representing the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9546.907s">He</a> was here to take the input of the people who were there at that meeting.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9579.388s">I</a> believe the gentleman was employed by the mayor as he was 10 years ago when they had a public hearing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9585.61s">And</a> unbeknownst to anyone until the question was asked, the, the, um, the July 3rd date was as a result of two days ahead of time, the mayor having this conversation and asking for an extension to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9598.922s">When</a> an ascertainment hearing took place at that meeting in May, and there was about 10 or 15 people here, but how do you have the hall filled with people when you have it at 2 o'clock in the afternoon and people are working? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9609.889s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9610.99s">When</a> you have mostly senior citizens <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9612.81s">who</a> came up here and dredged up here and to make the complaint about not only that, but having no senior citizen discount, not having an opportunity to have public access, not having an opportunity to have their money that's paid each and every month to go into a slush fund that's held downstairs, you might as well just give it back to the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9630.124s">If</a> they're not getting used of cable access and they're being charged for it, how do you take that money and account for it and tell the people you're getting public access when you're not getting it? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9640.893s">That's</a> not transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9642.656s">That's</a> a shadow way of doing things. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9644.899s">I'm</a> going to keep it in secrecy. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9646.621s">Well,</a> what's the big secret here? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9648.424s">Are</a> we or are we not going to have public access? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9650.867s">That's</a> the bottom line. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9652.189s">And</a> the mayor has refused intentionally to answer that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9655.94s">because</a> he does not want public access on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9658.381s">Whether</a> it praises him or criticize him, he doesn't want it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9661.802s">The</a> only thing he has is Channel 15 that he's used exclusively for himself, which is a high school educational channel that everyone else in this room is excluded from using. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9672.126s">It's</a> wrong.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9700.942s">Point</a> of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9701.482s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Panta. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9703.242s">Show</a> us the document where that information is coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9705.723s">Because</a> none of us in this room have a document that says a studio is going up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9710.504s">And</a> how is it going to be funded and when is it going to begin?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9736.423s">picture</a> that took place up there, that whole situation is now on hold. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9740.124s">There's</a> absolutely nothing going on at the vocational school or the high school where it's going to put that studio up there.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_sB_5XTIqkQk/2025-03-21_sB_5XTIqkQk.html">Medford City Council - June 16, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=417.961s">Council</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=419.922s">Louise,</a> you have $7,300 here for executive salaries.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=445.307s">So</a> you mean getting paid for sick and vacation time?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=449.549s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=454.731s">And</a> then let's go down here to debt service of $62,900.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=467.444s">Pardon</a> me?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=471.066s">So,</a> in other words, under debt service, the estimates were over? <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=475.97s">They</a> overestimated?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=490.559s">And</a> under Workman's Comp, as we heard tonight, we have a $276,000 surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=497.397s">Correct?</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=508.186s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=508.947s">Now</a> we just reviewed tonight's health budget and it's an increase of almost $700,000, but now group health insurance, we're transferring $102,000 from apparently last year's, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=526.539s">What</a> I don't understand, if this is all coming under GIC, this is a huge shift in payments here. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=533.822s">You're</a> saving $102,000 in one year, and you're going to increase of $700,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=536.983s">Anyone</a> who's on GIC needs to understand that the Patrick administration left office $192 million with Group Insurance Commission in debt because they didn't fund it for the last three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=554.069s">So</a> cities and towns now had to pick that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=556.318s">when</a> there were 50 cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=557.778s">Now</a> there are 60 cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=559.979s">That's</a> 10 more cities and towns than when they first started out with, or before Medford even jumped on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=565.801s">That's</a> more members, that's more payments, and now the fees are going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=569.802s">I</a> believe the legislature bailed out the $192,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=573.003s">And</a> I just don't understand why cities and towns such as ourselves are gonna have to pay for this increase that we were told before by going to GIC, members that are in GIC, <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=585.876s">over</a> time would have a reduction in rate, and the city of Medford would save over the next five and a half, six years approximately $24 million in insurance claims. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=594.043s">I</a> just think this is very confusing to the individual rate payer who might be an employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=601.37s">But</a> I just think it's really unfair that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts would be doing this, because all it looks like it's another way of beating around a state budget, especially that deals with cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=613.528s">And</a> when you're asking cities and towns to be involved, it's like asking the taxpayers in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=618.269s">You</a> have a seven and a half million dollar surplus in your water and sewer account, but we're going to raise your rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=622.75s">This</a> is a complete reverse. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=624.45s">Here</a> you are with 50 cities and towns hoping to get lower rates and they don't fund it and they don't fund it for the last three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=631.132s">I</a> just think that's a public comment that I'd like to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=634.972s">You're</a> taking $80,000 out of highway salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=641.63s">This</a> is really a tough one to deal with. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=643.411s">We</a> just got through building a $14 million building and we've been asking for more people, more personnel and more supplies, more equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=653.596s">I</a> just don't understand why we're, why weren't the individuals hired?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=681.305s">So</a> who is that person?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=687.151s">This</a> is part of his salary?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=691.315s">Which</a> ends as of June 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=695.352s">because</a> this is a June 30th ending budget, correct?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=698.534s">But</a> he is staying on until January 1st of next year.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=702.257s">And</a> he will be paid once again as an acting commissioner?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=705.939s">At</a> a rate of, I believe, 975 hours per year, because that's all I think he's allowed to work.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=713.004s">960,</a> whatever the number is.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=715.026s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=716.487s">And</a> engineering salaries, it's another $15,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=718.908s">Why</a> is that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=730.143s">Louise,</a> you were there the night when the engineering office was, um, came down to us and, um, I'm looking at, I think our city engineer had asked her approximately 30 to $40,000 for some simple upgrades, like maybe a new telephone because they're sharing four people share one phone, a new desk and new file cabinets. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=752.872s">I</a> think that would be more appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=755.362s">to</a> have that being transferred over here, then the ridiculousness of saying we might have to go out and bond for that, as was said that night, that's complete insanity.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=767.891s">No,</a> I would hope not, because that's what was mentioned that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=770.613s">And</a> I don't understand why there is no way that that $40,000, $30,000, $40,000 cannot be found and just put into the transfer account to take care of that, because I just don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=785.112s">You</a> talk about snow removal over here of a $473,000 item. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=791.314s">How</a> much did the state give us, and is there still a balance left in the snow account?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=869.336s">So</a> are you saying that this transfer of $473,200 to the snow and ice overtime budget account makes us even or not? <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=880.118s">Or</a> is this still a balance?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=889.16s">So</a> we're still behind 1.6. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=890.0s">Yep.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=922.795s">I</a> believe last year they were allowed to carry over that budget deficit for one year.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=928.781s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=929.201s">Now,</a> if we're going to have this $1.4 million starting off this next fiscal year, I would assume that the budget is inaccurate that's being proposed to us right now because we already have a budget deficit to deal with.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=956.566s">Well,</a> for years, I think all the councils in our own way have been saying that the snow and ice, the budget account, it's really not an accurate number because each and every year it just goes way over that particular number. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=968.192s">And</a> we're into the position we're on right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=970.173s">We</a> have to transfer in this particular case. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=972.875s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=974.19s">Really,</a> once again, if anyone were to look at that, the assumption would be that you're transferring from A to B that's going to balance it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=980.792s">But</a> it really, this Snow and Ice overtime account does not get balanced out. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=984.713s">It's</a> just a reduction to the dollar amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=987.134s">So</a> my question to you is, of all these transfers, how many of these people, how many of these transfers represent the same issue? <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=994.016s">I</a> mean, it's just, it's not a complete reduction. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=996.156s">It's</a> just helping to lower it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1002.71s">It's</a> a complete reduction. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1003.67s">Yes,</a> it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1004.151s">So</a> snow and ice is the only one?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1012.154s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1012.535s">But</a> that right now is only for one more year, which is this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1014.916s">So</a> as of next year, there is no way you can carry that over. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1017.537s">You're</a> going to have to maintain. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1018.537s">You're</a> going to have to balance that out one way or the other.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1021.779s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1023.28s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1041.048s">On</a> that motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1041.869s">Um,</a> Louise, let's go back to the veteran services again, please.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1046.673s">We</a> have salaries at 25,000 and then we have services at 7,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1049.896s">So</a> they're giving up approximately, um, $33,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1054.18s">Now</a> is the $25,000 for the secretary that was in the office?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1063.697s">But</a> I thought they hired somebody.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1068.579s">So</a> for how long was that vacancy there that generated this kind of money?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1076.623s">Six</a> or eight weeks? <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1077.683s">Months.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1078.084s">Oh,</a> months. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1078.484s">I'm</a> sorry.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1083.086s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1083.806s">And</a> then when we talk about veteran services, $7,900, that's an awful lot of money because there were a lot of veterans looking <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1089.734s">For</a> services, so what type of services were cut?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1107.879s">So</a> if they're not services, they look like they're items or veterans. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1115.722s">Why</a> does it come under service account?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1121.54s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1122.66s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1124.982s">And</a> jumping up to the last one, highway and sidewalks, $75,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1129.423s">I</a> mean, we are just so far behind on sidewalks right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1133.685s">Why</a> are we taking money out of that account?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1164.491s">That's</a> $140,000, I believe.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1195.047s">So</a> on this particular item, if that money is not expended, is that an allowable expenditure to be carried over to the next year?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1206.358s">Okay,</a> so this technically could revert back to the general fund, correct?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1211.96s">And</a> if it reverts back to free cash, to general fund, that $75,000 could be used for this year's budget rather than having it transferred to someone else.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1232.599s">I</a> hear what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1233.84s">But</a> when you walk around this city, as I have each and every day, and you see the streets, and you see the sidewalks, and you hear about the complaints, and you hear about people calling City Hall, and they don't get any responses back, and you see the potholes, and you see the crevices in the streets, and the islands, and everything, to have that money transferred back into snow and ice, I would rather have the mayor figure out where to get the money for snow and ice, because this is an immediate problem that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1258.656s">between</a> front ends and rear ends and people falling down and hurting their ankles. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1263.299s">The</a> other day I saw a lady with a wheel carriage try to negotiate a contract and then go out into the street and she got stuck with the wheel carriage in the middle of the street with the baby and the guy across the street had to come over and help her lift her up. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1274.988s">These</a> are just things. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1276.209s">This</a> is what's really a concern here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1279.031s">A,</a> no response to these type of issues, but more importantly to have this transfer <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1283.545s">go</a> into a snow and ice account that's already going to be a million, $400,000 in debt. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1288.808s">$75,000</a> is just a drop in the bucket for snow and ice, but $75,000 can go a long way for sidewalks and streets and curbs. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1297.033s">So</a> I'm going to recommend, Mr. President, that this $75,000 be not transferred from the from to the choose, but it reverts back to free cash and that be put back into the highway department for sidewalks immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1314.158s">We</a> have a motion for approval, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1316.498s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1352.367s">There's</a> two amendments.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1393.727s">And</a> your amendment, Councilor Penta, was? <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1395.648s">Is</a> under highway salaries, 010-422-5250 for $75,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1403.123s">be</a> transferred back to free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1407.444s">And</a> I'll tell you the reason why, because I believe it has no consequential position in this budget, because Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1413.745s">Miller</a> just indicated, even by putting $473,200, it still doesn't bring in a balance to the budget, and you're going to have a residue of $1,400,000 left to pay in the snow and ice account. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1433.355s">So</a> I'm taking it out of here and transferring it to free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1441.16s">It's</a> as amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1443.281s">So</a> it's amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1444.241s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1444.602s">So</a> it's amended.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1446.403s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1446.743s">This</a> is, let me explain it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1448.044s">One</a> more time. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1449.845s">One</a> more time. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1450.345s">You</a> can have a motion for approval, but I'm amending the motion for approval to just divert one of the subject matters because as Council Knight just asked the question, exclusive of the snow and ice account, <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1462.54s">does</a> this balance out the budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1464.321s">And</a> you said yes, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1466.263s">And</a> I'm saying take the $75,000, which I believe is part of making this budget balance, supposedly, and instead of putting it to the balance of the budget, just add that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1476.611s">It's</a> going to be added to the snow and ice account, which has a balance of $1,461,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1479.353s">It's</a> just a drop. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1483.917s">So</a> that 75 can go into free cash and automatically just find its way right back to the highway department. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1489.201s">So</a> these sidewalks and streets and curbs and roadways <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1492.577s">can</a> get immediate attention.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1587.955s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1588.735s">So</a> you're saying that the $170,000 that's earmarked for the snow and ice, the $70,000 is for the overtime, $170,000, that has to be the minimum for the next year?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1602.482s">And</a> this year, we just got through spending $1,600,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1604.043s">And</a> all I'm saying is take the $75,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1609.457s">throw</a> that back into free cash, which is for this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1612.379s">And</a> yes, it will be once it's recertified the 1st of July, you can pull that $75,000 right out right away and just add that over and beyond that for which the highway department has its budget right now for sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1624.71s">They're</a> going to get an additional $75,000 just because you didn't expend it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1629.594s">That</a> doesn't mean you can't expend it after July 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1633.337s">This</a> is a desperate need in this community for these streets and sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1637.486s">In</a> this no way, by putting $75,000 into the budget, is this going to make a hill of beans on a $1,634,000 deficit? <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1645.472s">Mr.</a> President? <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1647.253s">Councilor?</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2063.071s">Let's</a> be clear on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2064.491s">My</a> motion is now being severed. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2066.852s">The</a> $75,000 is to take it out of the transferring from this particular highway account to be used to balance a budget that also <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2075.483s">It's</a> really still not balanced, because the snow and ice is not up to par. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2080.287s">But</a> by taking this and referring it to Free Cash, we don't have to wait for certification. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2087.232s">It'll</a> go to Free Cash, and immediately, that's $75,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2089.434s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuso.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2115.53s">Mr.</a> President, may I please finish?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2123.889s">The</a> $75,000 is very easy to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2125.89s">You</a> just put it into the account now, and you can take it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2128.693s">And</a> when you want to wait for the recertification to come in, the $75,000 can be recertified. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2133.537s">But</a> at least it's there right now, and it can be expended right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2136.619s">This</a> $75,000 becomes part of the free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2140.202s">What</a> do we have? <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2140.603s">$6.5</a> million or thereabouts in free cash? <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2143.885s">I</a> believe that is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2144.946s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2145.307s">With</a> $6.5 million in free cash, I'm not about to take <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2149.115s">$75,000</a> to try to balance a budget that should have been balanced properly and worry about $75,000 that should be going to sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2157.439s">So</a> you take the $75,000, you transfer it back to the at-present free cash account, and you're just right to check out now, so to speak, and start it right back into the highway department and add to their budget by $75,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2168.485s">The</a> point of clarification, Madam Vice President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2213.716s">To</a> be perfectly clear, tell me if I'm right or wrong, all right, Louise? <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2216.898s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2217.518s">If</a> this money, whatever this money is, goes into the free cash account right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2221.701s">It</a> can't!
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2225.964s">You</a> don't want to be the mayor?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2231.102s">It's</a> very frustrating if this money gets transferred into the free cash account rather than to balance the budget now We could take any one of these forget this one We could take any one of these items and make the request to have it transferred into free cash, correct?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2261.849s">And</a> whatever these dollars amounts might be, if in fact we have right now for free cash, we can write a check right now from our free cash account, correct?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2273.2s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2273.58s">And</a> that's what I said in the right... No, you didn't say it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2276.641s">I</a> just did. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2277.521s">You</a> didn't listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2277.941s">No,</a> you didn't.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2638.457s">I'd</a> be willing to withdraw my motion and to leave the $75,000 in the account so it doesn't become part of this transfer.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2801.561s">You</a> can buy the materials, Elise.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2822.185s">I</a> believe this money from the state allowed cities and towns to make whatever the expenditures needed to be to be expended by June 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2828.568s">All</a> they have to do is have a contract in hand.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2849.165s">They</a> could get another contractor. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2850.987s">As</a> long as they have a contractor in hand, whether the work gets done July or August, the money is expended.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2900.663s">To</a> strike that section.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2925.261s">But</a> you're also have a residue right now of $1,461,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2929.743s">I</a> mean, if this was going to make it come even, that's one thing, but you said the mayor was going to be coming in with other papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2936.325s">I</a> anticipate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2937.506s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2938.406s">Possibly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2938.806s">We'll</a> wait for that anticipation.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3172.406s">Just</a> a point of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3173.546s">Mr.</a> President, you made a declaration that that would, <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3178.525s">apparently</a> get to the, uh, snow and ice removal over time.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3187.37s">But</a> that may not necessarily be true because the mayor may have decided to make an additional change. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3193.113s">So</a> I really wouldn't want to, I wouldn't want to have that be said that that's where the deduction would come. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3199.917s">There</a> were a lot of other items over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3202.138s">And,</a> um, as Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3203.439s">Miller</a> has just indicated earlier, the mayor intends to come in with additional papers, hopefully, <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3208.238s">for</a> the transfers or payouts, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3212.28s">So</a> I think it should be just said, it's strictly a line item deletion period.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3346.141s">Is</a> this Council Penta? <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3348.341s">No,</a> it's Lisa's Pizza, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3350.462s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3350.702s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3350.882s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3351.602s">Can</a> you tell us what you're going to do there? <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3354.098s">Used</a> to be a breakfast, lunch, and late afternoon sandwich place. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3357.121s">What's</a> your intention for the place?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3363.447s">And</a> what time do you expect to open?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3367.171s">In</a> the morning?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3383.631s">Wait</a> a minute, on the recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3385.692s">I'm</a> looking here at your request of hours of operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3387.872s">It</a> says 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3388.712s">to</a> 2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3389.352s">How</a> do we do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3390.532s">You</a> only can go to 11 o'clock at night.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3395.253s">Well,</a> it's on the application here that's been signed off.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3402.275s">But</a> they close at 11 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3403.415s">This</a> goes to 2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3404.355s">in</a> the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3405.969s">He</a> has to go for a special permit.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3409.592s">What</a> are your hours? <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3410.373s">You</a> put here, you're going to stay open to 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3412.635s">to</a> 2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3414.556s">You</a> need a special permit after 11 o'clock at night.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3419.401s">Nobody</a> told you that? <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3420.502s">Didn't</a> anybody read this application?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3452.124s">Lisa's</a> Pizza is open to 2 o'clock in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3456.166s">He</a> just said Lisa's Pizza is open to 2 o'clock in the morning.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3462.708s">But</a> you don't have a special permit for this location.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3499.792s">They</a> don't.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3502.794s">He</a> doesn't because he made an application months ago for which was never acted upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3506.949s">Tasty</a> Gourmet made an application months ago to stay open until 2 AM, but then apparently it was withdrawn or what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3513.776s">They've</a> never been open until 2 o'clock in the morning.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3518.24s">I</a> said it was withdrawn, apparently it was withdrawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3521.523s">It's</a> never been open.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3527.149s">I</a> think all you have to do is come.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3610.478s">Well,</a> I think he knows.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3914.037s">Madam</a> President, <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3916.327s">For</a> such a long period of time, this city has been struggling with its maintenance of buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3921.331s">And</a> unfortunately, this present administration, who led the charge for new school buildings, along with some community members, has dropped the ball over the last few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3933.781s">And</a> school buildings that are approximately 12, 13 years old are now in excess of over a million dollars worth of repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3941.027s">We're</a> getting ourselves into the same position that we were <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3943.66s">as</a> to why we had to build new buildings after some 50, 60 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3947.081s">This</a> 5% allocation is definitely within the guidelines that the Commonwealth of Mass Department of Education requires as it relates to maintenance of buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3956.102s">I</a> believe that that's the law as it relates to the repayment schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3960.463s">I</a> don't ever remember seeing a report from the Commonwealth of Mass saying 5% was ever put into a school department budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3968.064s">So,</a> in fact, we got our school budget here tonight, and we're going to be meeting, I believe, next Monday evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3973.953s">between</a> now and next Monday evening, I think it would be appropriate for the school department to show us by each individual school over and beyond the cost of their salaries, books, and everything else, a 5% budget allocation for school building maintenance and upkeep as we start to get ourselves going. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3991.709s">Councilor</a> Caraviello, I want to thank him for some in his first year of his being elected to the city council some three years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3998.615s">He</a> brought this to the attention of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4001.062s">We</a> have asked for an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4002.143s">We've</a> never received an update, and we keep hearing constantly of concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4007.186s">Medford</a> High School is a perfect example. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4008.827s">The</a> outside of the building looks like the most unappetizing or most, excuse me, unappealing entrance to any school building here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4017.192s">It's</a> recognized as being the flagship of our community, and it really doesn't do this city proud. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4022.435s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I move approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4026.137s">So</a> in concert with what we asked for the school department on the council resolution last week, <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4031.302s">And</a> we ask this also, and this shouldn't be a hard thing to do, because if the numbers are there and if they have to be added to it, if I understand correctly, the school budget is up by $1.8 million this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4043.227s">So</a> for whatever that represents, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4046.048s">But</a> I think this is too important of an issue to drop by. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4048.589s">And</a> I think this desperately really needs to be in the budget each and every succeeding years, because I just don't want to see any municipal building fall into a state of disrepair. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4058.914s">There's</a> no need for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4060.588s">And</a> the cost is just, it would be just too much of a burdensome. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4064.069s">So</a> I move approval, Madam President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4067.89s">Roll</a> call vote.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4326.486s">I'm</a> president on anyone who might be watching. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4328.607s">Um,</a> I believe at some point in time while the construction was going on for the new science labs and subsequent to that, um, the alarm system, um, apparently is either not working properly or if it has been adjusted and remediated. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4341.912s">Um,</a> we still haven't gotten an answer back on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4344.393s">And</a> this has been going on a daily basis while school is in attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4347.954s">The</a> unfortunate part about all of this is we're taking a, <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4351.805s">good</a> firefighter and putting them up at the school on a daily basis, taking one firefighter off his regulatory duty. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4361.551s">I</a> think we asked for this information some three weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4365.393s">The</a> mayor is yet to respond. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4367.675s">And</a> coincidentally regarding responses, if we looked in our packet this weekend, we're getting responses back from the mayor dating back to 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4375.579s">If</a> we looked at our packet this weekend, there was a whole host of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4380.686s">If</a> he can go back to 2014 and he can't stay current ones, I just don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4386.09s">But</a> this is too important of an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4388.752s">We're</a> always looking at hiring more firemen and policemen and public safety personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4393.595s">But</a> when we take one of the public safety people and have to leave them up in the school just in case the alarm goes off after we spent millions of dollars and we can't figure it out, I think there needs to be a reason why. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4404.943s">And</a> I don't even know if the contractors should be held liable for this if they're the ones that knocked out the alarm system. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4410.282s">But</a> the fact of the matter is, it wasn't working. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4412.763s">If</a> it's working now, then let us be informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4415.325s">If</a> it's not working, I think the resolution fits the purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4419.607s">Because</a> this does definitely cost us man hours and dollars on a daily basis.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4455.956s">Point</a> of further clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4457.537s">I</a> understand what Councilor Camus was saying, but maybe he'd understand what I was saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4461.159s">You're</a> taking a firefighter, whether he's on his regular tour of duty or overtime. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4465.061s">If</a> the overtime could have been used <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4467.943s">to</a> augment another firefighter for a particular service, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4471.285s">But</a> you're paying overtime for a service that is not fire-related. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4475.247s">It's</a> not part of their regulatory duty.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5014.845s">Another</a> one. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5015.425s">I'd</a> like to move suspension.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5433.391s">There's</a> a resident who would like to speak regarding a council resolution we would discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5438.075s">Very</a> good.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5641.085s">Council</a> Penton? <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5643.326s">While</a> this body did ask to do that, I thank you for bringing this up again, whether it's 100, 200, <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5649.838s">Or</a> maybe the simplest thing to do is just leave it at a very minimal rate, because it's a six, seven week operation at the very most, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5657.642s">Number</a> two, as I said before, it's like a business. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5661.284s">It's</a> a lost leader for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5662.624s">It's</a> the one thing that they can offer to this community, to the rate payers, the taxpayers, the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5667.547s">And</a> it's just for Medford folks anyway to begin with. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5672.129s">Why</a> they have to keep going up, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5673.69s">I</a> mean, does the cost of a lifeguard go up? <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5676.331s">Does</a> the cost of the maintenance go up? <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5677.752s">Maybe</a> it does, but sometimes you have to eat that <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5680.158s">And</a> tell the taxpayers, listen, you deserve something, and we're willing to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5683.759s">And</a> that's what your tax dollars is all about, helping out the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5687.421s">You</a> know, there was a lady here last week, and she her daughter was all upset because she heard that she may not be able to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5692.722s">And</a> it was going to go from $5 to $20 for a walk and pass and all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5697.244s">I</a> just hope that the board tonight looked at it very seriously to the point that, you know, maybe they have a little bit more leniency in their hearts, so to speak, to say, hey, you know, we just can't keep doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5708.799s">Just</a> because you're going to make it easier for seniors and disability people, we're going to put it on the backs of someone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5714.182s">That's</a> not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5715.183s">Absolutely</a> not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5716.203s">That's</a> the worst thing you can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5717.644s">That's</a> the worst logic that this community can have, telling people who want to go to Wrights Pond, well, we'll reduce it for the seniors and the handicapped people, but everyone else is going to have to pay more to make up the difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5728.01s">That's</a> not what good government is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5729.391s">That's</a> bad government. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5730.472s">It</a> doesn't work for the people, and it doesn't work for the city of Medford, as far as I'm concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5735.234s">So</a> I thank you for bringing it up.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5845.62s">Just</a> as a point of information, you bring up a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5848.682s">And</a> if I understand correctly, air rights, and this will involve Medford and Somerville, because I believe they touch on both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5856.046s">I</a> believe that's a legislative enactment. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5858.253s">that</a> has to be passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5861.034s">Not</a> one city can just take advantage of having air rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5865.134s">And</a> there has to be a purpose for the air rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5867.195s">Who</a> is the beneficial factor to the air rights? <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5869.375s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5870.596s">Who</a> did you say said that, Barbara Rubel? <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5873.536s">I</a> wish you had told the council about that ahead of time.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5916.103s">Could</a> we also amend it further, beside the minutes, any etchings, sketchings, drawings, whatever was presented this evening? <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5922.21s">Yeah,</a> that would be a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5923.852s">Maybe</a> they should just come before the council.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=6269.131s">Also,</a> Mr. President, tonight's resolution, if the city clerk would move it expeditiously to have this forwarded to the school department, because that 5% building maintenance dollar amount for each school needs to be included. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=6283.697s">We</a> never had it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=6284.357s">I</a> think it's about time we have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=6285.918s">And</a> I think we have to start ourselves going on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=6287.899s">So</a> this resolution that we had tonight, 15 536, <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=6292.221s">$15,536</a> needs to likewise be included.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=6300.627s">But</a> they can break down. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=6301.748s">If</a> there is no dollar amount allocated for school maintenance, then I'm not voting for the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=6306.131s">If</a> there is, then I'll let them show it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=6313.177s">They're</a> voting on the budget when? <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=6315.418s">Monday</a> night.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=6323.939s">All</a> Roy has to do is tell us whether it is or it isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=6326.02s">And</a> the answer is going to be why. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=6327.26s">Right.</a> <h2><a href="../2025-03-21_JknWFpZeyhQ/2025-03-21_JknWFpZeyhQ.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 9, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3051.482s">Mr.</a> President and folks who might be watching who don't have the opportunity to be here tonight and understand how we got to the position that we're in. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3059.366s">As</a> a point of clarification, in the budget meeting that we had tonight regarding the Method Public Library, the question was asked of Mr. Boutelier, who is the librarian, why didn't this information come forward on these type of requests come forward before? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3074.774s">And</a> he did indicate that the prior budget director through the administration <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3078.749s">told</a> them not to present that to come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3081.471s">So</a> the scuttlebutt as it relates to why it got to this point right here is a result of the frustration of the folks, you folks, that are here tonight and those folks that might be watching that couldn't make it here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3091.577s">This</a> is nothing more than a reactionary plan, not actionary, reactionary, because the administration understands that the people of this community, especially the people who support the library, are completely frustrated with the inaction going six years to get waivers <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3108.024s">to</a> get waivers to be certified absolutely makes no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3112.467s">You</a> want to go for one year, two years, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3116.59s">$225,000,</a> whatever that dollar amount might be or needs to be on an annual basis, that should have been included in the budget to keep this city abreast of where it should be rather than seeking a waiver. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3126.337s">Because</a> one of these days a waiver would not be made available. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3129.78s">And</a> if the city did not have the finances to pick up on that waiver, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3133.266s">We've</a> been sitting on $6.5 million of free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3137.267s">$6.5</a> million of free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3139.027s">And</a> over the last five to six years, this has been a growing from $1.5 million up to $6.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3145.289s">The</a> Medford Library is like the stepchild to the school buildings, the public buildings in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3152.151s">Councilor</a> Caraviello, if he was here, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3154.636s">And</a> his first term three years ago indicated with these new buildings that we have, these new school buildings, 12 years old, they're already a million dollars in need of repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3163.666s">That's</a> absolutely unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3166.289s">And</a> you folks out there who are supporters of the library and understand what the value of what a book can do, when a child opens that book and reads it, it's the greatest learning utensil that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3177.39s">over</a> and beyond a teacher, making sure that the teacher teaches the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3180.631s">But</a> when that child picks up a book and opens it and reads it and understands what's in that book and puts a smile on his face, whether it's for pleasure or entertainment or whether it's for education, that is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3192.313s">And</a> when you have a stupid, and that's what I call it, a stupid kiosk parked in front of your public library that stops people to go in there to bring a book or to pay a book off and come out and find a ticket <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3205.495s">That's</a> the fastest way to lose a patron to come to your Medford Public Library. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3209.876s">I</a> don't believe in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3210.856s">I</a> won't accept it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3212.437s">To</a> me, that is not what a public library is about. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3214.997s">A</a> public library is like a school. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3216.698s">It's</a> a basis of education. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3218.518s">It's</a> a central point in this community of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3221.839s">You</a> folks out there tonight, and those who might be watching, you folks made this happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3226.68s">You</a> were the actionary force that called the mayor's hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3230.561s">And</a> that's how you got it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3232.201s">And</a> I hope this doesn't have to be done in every other part of this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3235.397s">But</a> you folks should be complimenting yourselves, knowing your kids are going to have a library. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3240.178s">And</a> if I have my way, you won't ever have to come before this podium to ask for this again, because it'll be there each and every year like it's supposed to be.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3846.749s">Super.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3848.03s">Councilor</a> Penta? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3850.285s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Camuso for bringing this up because one of my greatest feelings in government was being the chairperson for Governor Salucci here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3861.954s">And</a> as everyone knows, this is an extremely democratic community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3866.337s">But</a> we won the city of Medford by six votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3869.239s">And</a> that was a great accomplishment because it was just symptomatic of his winning throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3877.646s">He</a> definitely was a people's person. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3879.985s">He</a> had a wonderful father, I met him, wonderful wife and two beautiful daughters. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3884.648s">He</a> just really exemplified what a leader should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3888.211s">He</a> never threw his weight around to say, I'm the governor. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3890.993s">He</a> was just, he could walk in here right now and he would sit down and he would just be like one of the people, truly exemplifying what a leader should be all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3898.298s">And</a> I am very fortunate to have had that pleasure and that honor to not only work on this committee, but to be his campaign manager here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3906.009s">and</a> very proud of the fact that not only did he win here in the city of Medford, but more importantly, he won for all the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, because I think his record, upon reflection, will show that he definitely was a people's person and governor. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3919.073s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3932.276s">And</a> that's why. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3932.977s">That's</a> why they love them. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3934.037s">But</a> wait a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3934.882s">But</a> that's why this November, I'm going to win and be your new mayor.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3948.11s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3993.236s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3998.18s">Did</a> you just say you work there or do you own the store? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4000.481s">I</a> own the store. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4000.982s">You</a> own the store and you're the applicant for the license, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4004.224s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4004.825s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4005.365s">I</a> didn't understand that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4181.442s">Let</a> me ask you a question, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4182.783s">You</a> have a laundry mat.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4184.944s">And</a> you want to put a Kino license in there and you want to put Kino in the laundry map?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4202.37s">Well,</a> is the other part of that, is the requirement that you have to have somebody in there at a desk, at a Kino desk to make sure that they're the right age?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4212.357s">You</a> have an attendant there at all times?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4470.582s">You</a> got a ticket yourself, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4472.803s">Did</a> you get a ticket yourself?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4524.923s">On</a> this subject that you're talking, you're not the first person to complain, but you're saying something that rings true to all the parking lots, because that signage was supposed to be changed to three hours, and it's still at two hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4539.374s">And</a> if you notice, when you talked about the funeral home, if you look across the street in front of a two-family house, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4544.587s">There</a> were people still packing out there and trying to put money in front of that two-family house that was supposed to come down in January when the chief of police was here. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4551.369s">It</a> was one of the first nights we had this huge discussion on kiosks in the square in certain locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4560.191s">This</a> is just symptomatic of why this whole system has to go, because it's inconsistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4565.413s">It's</a> unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4566.853s">It</a> doesn't truly reflect upon you as a businessperson. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4569.74s">If</a> you're going to have to be worried about where your patrons go, and if they're going to get a ticket, and if they're going to express they're not coming back, like you said, if there were meters or something more easily understandable, hey, you see a meter, you know what a meter means. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4582.808s">But</a> the city didn't go that option, and they went through this idea of kiosks, and some of the spots just don't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4589.031s">Now,</a> you talked about in front of the funeral home where you're at. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4591.933s">In</a> front of Elmont Glass, I believe, there's a kiosk, and if you go further up the street, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4596.062s">In</a> front of a dentist's office, there's a kiosk, which makes absolutely no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4600.644s">You</a> go across the street in West Medford Square in front of a shoe store on the side street by the railroad tracks, he has a kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4608.068s">But</a> you go further down the street in West Medford to the Arlington line, where there's a block of stores there, and there's no kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4616.492s">You</a> go on Boston Avenue, the corner of Boston Avenue and Arlington Street, I believe there's eight stores there, businesses, and there's no kiosk there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4625.268s">It's</a> a huge inconsistency, it's absolutely totally unfair, and whatever you could come up with, a suggestion to me would be, I wouldn't want to amend it, I'd want to get rid of it, because it doesn't serve any purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4638.17s">That's</a> not what this council was looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4640.531s">The</a> committee that first formed to review all of this was to have a traffic enforcement, not a traffic enhancement program, revenue enhancement, especially to an out-of-towner. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4649.873s">So</a> I thank you for coming and telling us your plight. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4653.403s">You're</a> just one of many, and since tonight, this afternoon, when I met this lady, she indicated to me not only that she put the money in the machine, the machine said it didn't take the money, and when she finally put it in a second time, she got a receipt for another car, which wasn't hers, which means that the person prior to her did not take her receipt. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4677.332s">So</a> now, she put the money in, she has no, so that's now, she's up to 50 cents. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4681.857s">Now</a> she had to put a third quarter in to make it 75, so it spit out her number plate on that particular receipt. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4688.22s">So,</a> there's just so many things, just so many problems with this thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4691.962s">And</a> I'm sorry, as a business person, because that's what my concern is. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4695.663s">You're</a> the guy, the small business person that's getting hurt throughout this entire community, and I apologize on behalf of the city that you have to go through that, but I can assure you, it's gonna go. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4705.688s">It's</a> gonna go.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4757.406s">That</a> dollar amount is absolutely incorrect because right now nobody knows what that dollar amount might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4762.809s">If</a> you read the contract and the contract talks within the first year, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4766.013s">And</a> I believe the first year the stat up number is 900,000, but they've collected almost close to 300,000 so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4771.54s">But</a> there are seven infractions in this contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4774.457s">in</a> the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4775.557s">Name</a> the major one that you could go to court and get rid of them with.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4787.962s">Well,</a> I don't have my book with me tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4789.382s">I</a> didn't realize we were going to get into this, but one of the real main ones is when- You said seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4793.264s">Would</a> you wait a minute? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4793.984s">No,</a> no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4794.604s">One</a> of the real main ones was when the gentleman, Mr. Nash, came here, they were supposed to have a public program that <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4801.423s">indoctrinated</a> their employees to what they were supposed to do, knowing the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4805.446s">Number</a> one, tagging people who had permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4807.748s">Number</a> two, driving around the streets of the city of Medford without having their cars properly leaded. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4812.372s">Number</a> three, giving tickets out in public parking lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4817.315s">Four,</a> five, I just don't have it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4821.739s">They're</a> there, they're there.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4843.792s">Well,</a> you know something, Councilor? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4845.193s">That's</a> your opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4845.894s">In</a> my, I feel very, very comfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4847.474s">You</a> know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4848.575s">You</a> were on this council when the vote took place a few years ago to take a million dollars from the water and sewer account to balance the budget of the mayor's budget, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4856.2s">You</a> took it from one account because you couldn't balance the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4858.942s">You</a> took over a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4860.543s">And</a> you voted for her. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4861.463s">And</a> I voted for her too.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4864.465s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4864.685s">But</a> this situation is entirely different. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4867.206s">Well,</a> why are you bringing that up? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4868.486s">If</a> you have to pay to get rid of it and to save the small business person, whatever it costs, that's what I would intend to do.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4876.428s">I</a> would mitigate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4877.168s">Pardon</a> me?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5022.34s">He</a> said this council, look, I did not vote for this kiosk program. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5025.723s">I</a> did not vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5027.165s">I</a> only allowed the mayor to go and to negotiate for a contract up to 10 years and then represent it back to the council and compare it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5034.433s">Check</a> your notes, check your notes, April of 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5036.395s">Then</a> we came back in September 12th of 2014 and we had a two. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5042.401s">two</a> rinky dink piece of paper that said confidential as if the city was to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5047.342s">And</a> the city and the mayor and the budget director at that time would entertain it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5053.103s">This</a> is getting so blown out of hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5055.044s">I'm</a> sticking to my comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5056.384s">You</a> know, I would mitigate to get rid of the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5059.405s">If</a> he doesn't like it, he doesn't have to like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5061.465s">He</a> doesn't support me anyway.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5164.554s">I</a> am going to wrap it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5165.615s">I</a> am going to wrap it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5166.395s">I'm</a> not going to dignify the comment he just made that I don't have a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5169.718s">I</a> don't have to say anything as to what I'm going to do and how I'm going to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5173.741s">I'm</a> telling you that I would <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5176.623s">mitigate</a> the plan to get out, and if it's gonna cost money, who cares? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5180.424s">I'm</a> more concerned about saving the businesses that are losing business right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5184.565s">And</a> if a guy like that has to come here and defend his position as it relates to having to pay quarters to give his patrons to put in a kiosk so he can do business, and the guy down the street with the coffee shop has to do the same thing, and other parts of the city don't have it, that's unfair, that's unjust, and as far as I'm concerned, it's got to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5203.089s">And</a> whatever it takes to get rid of it, that's what we're going to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5205.211s">Thank</a> you very much, Councilor.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6286.073s">I</a> and many people that I know never got that robocall, so I don't know who the 57,000 people he's talking about.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6400.843s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6401.844s">Can</a> we also amend that to get all the tickets that have been abated?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6538.684s">The</a> first, the quarter that just came back in from the Commonwealth of Mass had an increase overall in the state by some 400,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6546.137s">dollars</a> in tax revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6548.439s">It's</a> $400,000 more than projected. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6551.0s">It's</a> a sign that the economy is getting better throughout the entire Commonwealth, but specifically here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6558.365s">You</a> hit it right in the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6559.766s">Show</a> me the businesses that say they love them and they want them and it's good for their business. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6564.549s">Thank</a> you for the point of information,
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7055.938s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7056.998s">Mr.</a> President, I think it's quite obvious as to <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7060.85s">what</a> the resolution says. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7062.571s">And</a> I think it would be beneficial for us to have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7065.773s">I</a> believe before, I think it was some two years ago, we had asked of the budget director to have names associated next to positions in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7074.658s">And</a> we still don't have it as of now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7077.58s">But</a> last year, I believe that the budget increased. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7080.101s">And</a> on the school department side, it increased by almost $2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7083.603s">And</a> this year, it looks like it's a projection of 1.8 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7087.585s">The</a> whole budget of the city looks like it's up almost $5 million this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7091.168s">So</a> if there are new jobs and positions, if there are promotions that have taken place, I think it would be beneficial for the council to understand that rather than being told that, you know, this one got hired, that one got hired. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7101.054s">Plus</a> the fact that it's a budgetary issue and a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7104.597s">And</a> I just don't understand why all these titles and these positions are just not in the budget by name. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7111.301s">This</a> is what the council asked for years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7113.482s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7129.172s">Talking</a> about the resolution's names, you didn't see, you didn't listen to me.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7221.0s">Point</a> of clarification, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7226.824s">Point</a> of clarification, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7231.626s">In</a> the resolution after President's name, I'd be willing to take out address. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7235.809s">I'm</a> okay with that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7432.422s">That's</a> what the resolution says.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7600.672s">Councilor</a> Penton. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7602.913s">Can</a> you explain to the public the length of service that the assistant city engineer has? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7609.316s">Can</a> you explain the years of service that they have and what the promotion is? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7612.757s">You</a> can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7613.558s">All</a> we're looking for is the new people that came on, brand new people.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7621.241s">13</a> is your 14 year budget and this one is the 15, 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7629.135s">It's</a> the last budget in this budget.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7792.238s">It</a> doesn't make any, what does that have, it has nothing to do with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7794.739s">You're</a> saying this about somebody here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7796.94s">You're</a> saying something about somebody working here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7798.78s">Councilor,</a> you're asking for people's addresses. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7801.441s">I'm</a> not, I said I'm taking it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7803.141s">I</a> took out the word address. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7805.062s">Why</a> don't you listen? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7806.002s">I</a> did hear you, and guess what, I still don't support it because it's- Well, you don't have to support it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7828.229s">Well,</a> that's the motion.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8119.666s">I</a> want this ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8120.546s">I</a> don't want to wait.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8125.928s">So</a> you're moving this one?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8134.911s">Because</a> this is separate from the resolution.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8140.658s">Why</a> wouldn't you want to get it ahead of time?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8152.902s">If</a> you're going to ask that night, he's not prepared for it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8158.744s">I'm</a> going to move on my end first. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8162.685s">Roll</a> call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8164.286s">Roll</a> call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8165.246s">On</a> the resolution minus the word address.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8316.46s">Rick,</a> let me ask you a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8317.821s">We</a> got this book ahead of time to review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8320.621s">You're</a> going to be getting it on that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8322.861s">This</a> resolution has given you ample time to get it, review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8326.402s">And</a> so when that night comes and then you can just school can be school committees being tonight to do their budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8332.243s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8347.659s">Well,</a> this is both city and school.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8390.456s">On</a> that motion, if I understand that correctly, but can we get that as a separate document? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8395.72s">So</a> it's not inclusive in the budget, it's included, but as a separate document. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8399.764s">In</a> other words,
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8672.381s">Mr.</a> President, over this past weekend and up until this afternoon, I've received a decent amount of emails as it relates to Rights Pond, the new change in the rules and the regulations as it relates to what is taking place up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8688.65s">And</a> that has prompted a, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8690.632s">A</a> flurry of concern from not only senior citizens, but bike enthusiasts, and from people who now have enjoyed Wrights Pond for so many years, but now really question what is going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8704.154s">The</a> fee has now gone up from $35 to $50 this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8708.555s">And</a> the two passes that normally would be given on an annual basis have not, or is not being given. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8715.577s">And</a> that includes the separate, the walk-in passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8718.755s">Now</a> you have to pay for those separate. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8721.396s">So</a> if somebody shows up on foot or by a bike or by public transit, they're not going to be able to get in because apparently there's going to be a fee structure that's going to stop them from getting in. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8734.159s">Again,</a> I think what we're looking at, from my understanding from speaking with folks, this was from the administration handed down from the budget director to the parking board, parking commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8747.503s">I</a> mean, strike that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8749.103s">Is</a> it the park board? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8750.184s">Yeah,</a> the park board, I guess, as it relates to what's going on up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8754.586s">And</a> it's just not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8756.106s">You</a> know, this city gets hit on all kinds of taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8759.868s">Forget</a> the kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8761.149s">You</a> get the water. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8761.849s">You</a> get the sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8763.53s">You've</a> got your real estate tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8765.551s">You've</a> got your income tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8766.972s">And</a> you get your meals tax and room occupancy tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8770.774s">This</a> is just a simple little thing that only is in our community for about eight to nine weeks a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8777.077s">Rights</a> pawned. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8778.989s">Wrights</a> Point is not supposed to be a moneymaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8781.251s">Wrights</a> Point is supposed to be one of these simple little places that we as a community, the people who live in this city, have an opportunity to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8788.176s">Whether</a> you're a senior citizen, a mom with two or three kids, you want to spend your family and you go up there for the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8793.079s">It's</a> a Medford home-based luxury, so to speak, that a lot of other cities and towns don't have. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8800.265s">And</a> now to go from $25 to $35, and now you're up to $50 per person or per car, whatever the sticker is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8808.112s">And</a> now they're taking away the walk-in passes, and they're paying separate for those. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8813.315s">And</a> I know there's a concern I see. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8814.596s">I</a> think Bruce Kulick, is he still here? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8818.499s">He</a> had a concern as a bike enthusiast, because he's the chairperson of the Bike Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8825.003s">They</a> have major concerns over this, because now all these people are going to be charged to go up there and do something, eight to nine weeks out of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8833.028s">Last</a> year, they opened by the skin of their tooth. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8836.786s">play</a> equipment, I believe, up there at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8839.807s">And,</a> you know, it's just wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8842.248s">The</a> city should not be charging people for every single thing to try to make money on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8847.17s">There's</a> a few things you got to just pony up and say, hey, it's eight to nine weeks out of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8851.291s">And</a> sometimes you're not even going to get a good day if the weather was bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8854.672s">So</a> that cuts down the season short. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8857.113s">But</a> it's just unfortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8859.714s">And</a> I think hopefully there's people here that want to speak on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8862.885s">But</a> I just think the park commission, I think they meet on the 16th. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8866.148s">It's</a> a week from this Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8868.85s">I</a> believe that's what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8870.672s">And</a> it's at six o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8871.973s">And</a> I would hope people would just go there and express to them that their concern, you know, it's rights pawned. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8878.939s">It's</a> a, it's a little place for moms to bring their kids and maybe dad's on the weekend or grandparents or friends that might want to come, but charging and keep charging and charging. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8890.313s">You're</a> going to put people out of business for wanting to go there and enjoy something that we should be able to enjoy. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8895.596s">You</a> know, once upon a time, you didn't have to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8898.238s">And</a> now they want to charge you to keep you out of there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8901.459s">So</a> it doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8902.94s">So</a> the resolution, Mr. President, I know those people want to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8906.842s">I'd</a> like to have it forwarded to the, I believe it's the park board, the park commission, excuse me, that they review the new fee structure that they have for this year and give consideration that the rate increases <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8919.73s">are</a> just unfair to the citizens of Medford.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9037.845s">But</a> as a point of clarification, I was told it came from the prior budget director, and that was directed at the end of last year's season to raise the rates for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9047.87s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9049.231s">Right,</a> wrong, or indifferent, something happened because these rates got raised.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9754.318s">But</a> the city can stock it themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9755.659s">The</a> city can stock the pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9756.459s">So</a> we can buy the fish and stock it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9884.988s">Councilor</a> Pater. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9887.45s">Did</a> you already buy the pass?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9890.553s">So</a> is the pass singular, or do you have to buy one for each person?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9906.918s">So</a> prior to this rate increase, if you got your permit last year, you also got two walk-in passes.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9917.964s">But</a> if you did last year, you bought the $35 permit, you would get the two walk-in passes.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9924.028s">Oh,</a> OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9924.188s">You</a> don't know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9950.925s">No</a> matter how you look at Wright's Pond, because they have to pay for the lifeguards, and they have to pay for all the support. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9954.889s">To</a> me, it's like a business deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9956.31s">It's</a> a loss leader. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9957.491s">But</a> it's a good loss leader for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9959.882s">Because</a> if you're ever going to try to think and make money on that, and then you're going to just keep raising this rate each and every year, and it really doesn't make any sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9966.349s">And</a> it's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9966.75s">No,</a> I understand.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10003.835s">They're</a> 20.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10028.118s">So</a> to do the same thing this year.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10032.698s">$70</a> more.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10036.94s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10037.34s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10037.901s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10038.661s">15,</a> three times.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10220.988s">The</a> suggestion is you've heard it from enough people. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10223.491s">The</a> rate has gone up. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10226.073s">It's</a> gone up significantly. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10227.874s">Well,</a> you're going to get all the information that's going to tell you this is the reason why. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10231.377s">And</a> it's probably going to say, well, it's costing us money. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10234.8s">We</a> know it's costing us money and we know that the city is not making money on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10238.863s">But</a> Wright's point is not to be made a place to have money. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10242.426s">You</a> know, that lady, the last lady who just came up, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10245.322s">When</a> she hears a little girl in her car turn around and say that she thinks she may not be able to go to Wrightsbarn because it costs too much, you can't explain that to a 7, 8, or a 9-year-old kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10254.287s">We're</a> not going to say your city doesn't want you to go there because you don't have enough money in your pocket. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10259.17s">The</a> park board, the park commission should realize, listen, we have four or five parks all summer long and that you put park supervisors in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10267.554s">We</a> don't charge a citizen to go into any of those parks to participate in any of those programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10272.983s">And</a> they're there all day long, and they don't have to worry about a time curfew. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10277.187s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10277.848s">So</a> the difference between that and Rights Pond, there's no difference.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10311.248s">If</a> the mayor has the wherewithal to go out and get from Cummings $100,000, $150,000, he had the wherewithal to go to Wynn's Casino and get $100,000 for his pet projects, but he's not that concerned about the kids in this community in the summertime. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10325.526s">that</a> we have to keep raising the fees to try to maintain them, well that is not good government. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10331.013s">That's</a> poor government and that doesn't work for the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10334.177s">We</a> all know you're not going to make money at Wrights Pond and you're not going to make money in the summertime. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10338.724s">There</a> are some things you're just going to have to lose money on and you eat it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10342.068s">It's</a> a lost leader in business. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10343.805s">but</a> you're making the people come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10345.186s">Mr.</a> Ruggiero hit it right in the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10346.747s">You've</a> got to give them something to want to come here for. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10349.41s">He</a> just spent almost $275,000 because he found mysteriously this money to put into the library, but he's had it for the last six years because he wouldn't take it out of free cash.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10555.25s">I</a> believe Councilor Lungo said to revert the walk-in to $5, but to revert the $50 to $35. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10559.713s">We're</a> looking to revert to last year's rate, period.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10716.321s">There</a> have been some concerns as it relates to Magoon Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10718.782s">I</a> think we've all received emails from some of the neighboring folks that are down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10723.784s">Um,</a> I believe, um, the park is ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10727.166s">I</a> don't know what, what the problem might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10731.128s">Um,</a> but I believe, um, this is going to be referred to OCD, Lauren DeLaurento, because apparently this has come under her bailiwick and I just can't answer the question as to what the problems might be from the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10743.175s">They</a> just don't seem to be satisfied either, either with the work schedule or some of the concerns that are taking place at the park. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10749.759s">So</a> I think to be better informed, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10752.602s">Maybe</a> Lauren should just explain to us what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10754.603s">I'd</a> like to refer this.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10805.238s">And</a> refer it to the Office of Community Development for answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10807.6s">What</a> is the question we're asking? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10809.441s">They're</a> neighboring issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10810.222s">She</a> knows. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10810.542s">They've</a> been forwarded to her. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10811.803s">We</a> don't know what they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10812.624s">I</a> don't know what they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10813.685s">Lighting</a> is one of the main issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10817.972s">cars</a> being parked on the park.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10828.299s">She</a> knows what they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10829.16s">But</a> we don't.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10830.761s">So</a> we want to report back. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10832.062s">Well,</a> it's an unclear resolution, clearly.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11512.698s">Good.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11513.598s">Mr.</a> President, this morning, midday today, I met with some state agencies and one of the agencies that was <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11521.77s">At</a> issue was the Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11523.23s">Department</a> of Transportation, and one of the concerns as it relates to that was not only from my concern, but other folks' concern as it relates to their response and their response time. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11535.053s">Now,</a> you're telling us that we have a meeting scheduled for the 30th of June. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11540.253s">About</a> a month ago, a little bit less than a month ago, signage was in Medford Square indicating that they were going to be doing some construction on the bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11548.989s">None</a> of the business folks, yet, as we speak right now, have been notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11553.151s">The</a> chamber has not been notified as it relates to an update as to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11558.052s">Now,</a> the other day, coming into Saturday and Sunday, took these pictures. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11561.473s">I'll</a> just, we can pass them around. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11564.014s">As</a> you all know, they dug up the middle of the island. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11567.376s">Larry,</a> you want to pass that over there? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11568.816s">They</a> dug up the middle of the island. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11570.076s">In</a> the middle of the island, they left it, what, an eight <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11575.283s">to</a> 12-inch gully hole in the middle of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11581.045s">All</a> weekend long, they didn't put any plates on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11585.327s">And</a> by putting no plates on there, you can ask folks who are walking across the street, one person almost, because it was dark out at nighttime, almost fell into the hole. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11594.97s">But</a> that's not the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11595.81s">The</a> fact of the matter is, is there a clerk of the works? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11599.391s">Where</a> is the city on this particular matter? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11602.072s">Who's</a> monitoring what needs to be done <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11604.534s">just</a> because you put a cone, that doesn't mean that's going to resolve the subject matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11608.537s">And</a> if you look at the picture, you can see someone now trying to make a U-turn where the cones are, because they felt that's what they were able to do, that's what they thought it was supposed to be about. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11617.382s">This</a> whole thing has a history, and if you speak to OCD, they'll tell you the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11621.604s">This</a> has a history of the city not being involved on a timely, if not any kind of a basis, never mind the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11629.608s">And</a> this just doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11630.709s">And</a> I believe just yesterday morning, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11632.937s">They</a> hot topped it, and it's still not level. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11635.599s">And</a> they have 9,000 cones over there that don't even light up at nighttime. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11640.423s">Sometimes</a> you see those barrels that have the lights that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11642.724s">They</a> don't even have those. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11643.545s">They</a> just have cones that look like if you're a dunce in school, and you're a bad guy, and you're in trouble, you go sit in the corner and put the cone on your head. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11651.451s">This</a> is too much of a serious project. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11653.512s">And</a> the more you tell people that this is going to be almost four years, they can't believe it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11657.035s">A</a> 121-foot bridge is going to take almost four years to get itself built. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11663.058s">with</a> the state of technology that's out there today, with the state of construction that's out there today. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11669.402s">It's</a> mind-boggling. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11671.644s">And</a> then the second aspect of this is the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11675.166s">They've</a> never come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11676.086s">We've</a> asked to have them come back over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11678.208s">The</a> possibility of looking at putting the bus stop on Riverside Avenue, go down Riverside Avenue, change the route of River Street, have the bus go there, park there, comes back around the square, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11689.715s">and</a> then it goes through without tying up anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11692.117s">Maybe</a> no more than three to four extra minutes out of the normal route that it takes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11696.2s">Think</a> about it, you're talking about the seniors that live at 99 and the folks that live at 121. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11700.022s">The</a> way they have it projected now, you're gonna have to walk all the way down the ring road and then from under the ring road, you're gonna have to walk underneath the bridge over by 101 Main Street to get the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11710.209s">Where</a> now, if you follow the riverside to the river street, all they'd be doing is walking into Medford Square and picking up the bus there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11717.463s">And</a> all you'd be doing is displacing four car spaces that you could put, where you would be putting the buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11724.166s">These</a> are all options and these are all possibilities that need to be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11728.409s">And</a> the Medford City Council is the controller of the parking of the bus stops here in the city of Medford, not the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11734.432s">It's</a> the city of Medford, the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11737.053s">So,</a> Mr. President, what I'm proposing, in concert with Councilor Camuso's resolution, that we look at, is the MBTA coming to this meeting too? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11749.863s">But</a> is the person from the MBTA going to be here?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11772.067s">But</a> the last time we had this, Adam, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11776.931s">The</a> lady from the MBTA had to be, she was invited separately.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11781.032s">Cause</a> we were saying we never had this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11783.393s">I</a> think maybe about a year and a half ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11786.513s">So</a> I would like to make sure in your invite on the 30th, um, that a representative or the person from the MBTA who would be involved here in the city of method regarding bus stops is here and to, um, so we could explore once again, changing the bus stop instead of 21 main street to river street. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11806.427s">Redirecting</a> the traffic and all those that just come around.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11827.551s">But</a> I think what we need to discuss is not a matter of having a discussion, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11832.554s">I</a> think a matter of having them know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11835.275s">No,</a> a matter of a discussion expressing what our ideas would be and not to have them come back six, nine months later and decide to make a decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11843.06s">This</a> project is already designed, drawn up, has a battle plan and they're implementing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11849.563s">And</a> without any support or input from this council or the taxpayers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11854.846s">So</a> all these meetings that supposedly were going to take place and be so transparent, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11859.213s">just</a> never took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11860.094s">So</a> they're just going ahead and building what they want to build. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11864.336s">10,000,</a> excuse me, now it's up to 10 million, 10.1. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11867.859s">So</a> we've gone from 2.5 to 8.5 to 12.7, now down to 10.7. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11873.762s">So</a> we really don't even know what the true cost of this project is, because we've already had one, two, three, we've had five separate numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11881.067s">So,</a> you know, it's a bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11885.91s">It's</a> not a mausoleum. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11887.597s">It's</a> not an historical edifice. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11889.178s">It's</a> just a plain, simple bridge to make buses, cars, and traffic and trucks drive over. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11894.522s">This</a> is not the Longfellow Bridge in Boston, where you're looking at architectural scheme and design. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11901.507s">It's</a> 121 feet, Fred.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11921.423s">That</a> may be in your opinion.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11926.828s">On</a> the motion.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11932.033s">With</a> the invitation.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11974.351s">Mr.</a> President, Reverend Kilpatrick most recently just celebrated his 50 years as a pastor up at Monfield Plaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11982.958s">He's</a> just personally a wonderful advocate in his religious advocation. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11988.843s">He</a> was a former director at the West Medford Community Center, and he's been an extreme supporter <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11995.998s">not</a> only for those less fortunate, but for younger individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12000.079s">I</a> think it would be appropriate to invite him before the council to receive a citation and to let him know and let him be recognized within his community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12008.58s">50</a> years is a long time to serve in a profession, and it's a profession well-respected, and he is well-respected within the Baptist community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12018.442s">So</a> I move that paper, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12019.842s">On</a> the motion of Councilor Penter, all those in favor?<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_B5fALLGbAKg/2025-03-21_B5fALLGbAKg.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 2, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=907.18s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=908.3s">There</a> you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=909.901s">Maybe</a> I misunderstood it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=911.401s">So</a> I want you to make this perfectly clear before I make my comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=914.562s">You</a> have what you call a retention <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=918.53s">in</a> your example. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=921.473s">Could</a> you explain that again? <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=922.755s">The</a> retention pond? <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=923.696s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=924.096s">Could</a> you explain that again and why you're calling it that? <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=926.899s">What's</a> the purpose of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=928.18s">Okay,</a> so, sure.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=967.966s">So</a> you're saying that this retention pond would satisfy the proposal of mixed use and residential home housings that you're proposing? <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=980.025s">So</a> if the at present proposal by the developer takes place, this retention pond couldn't service it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1035.435s">If</a> I understand it, once again, if I'm looking at this and trying to understand it, <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1039.399s">This</a> retention pond with your proposal or whoever put this proposal together seems to be somewhat satisfactory with a lesser density use of housing, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1051.443s">And</a> by having that lesser density use of housing, the question then becomes of the housing that's being proposed, how many cars, how many vehicles? <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1062.466s">Because</a> if it's going to be according to our present zoning ordinances, I think it's two and a half cars per unit for condos. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1069.338s">And</a> if that's the case, how many cars would you proposing for how many units?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1114.692s">And</a> what you're proposing, is the height of the building, are buildings higher or lower than what's presently there?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1127.172s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1165.754s">Again,</a> just superficially, if we're looking at it from a private developer's perspective, he's trying to develop that to make the most amount of money at the highest density. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1174.936s">And</a> if we're looking at it from the community's perspective, City of Medford, area residents, immediate abutters, if something has to go there, it should be looked at as being the least intrusive, the least obstructive, and at the same time, <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1186.983s">beneficial</a> with a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1188.484s">The</a> entire community not only has a say, but there is some sense of agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1192.468s">So</a> I would suggest that before this, your proposal or to get your proposal going, even for the purposes of a discussion that I would think that you might have to bring this back to the developer and let them know that you've already been to the Medford city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1205.658s">I</a> mean, I, there's no way I could support what they're proposing. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1208.401s">It</a> just doesn't make any sense at all, but more concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1211.623s">I'm</a> more concerned about my community, our city, <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1214.106s">and</a> the immediate impact that the neighbors have, because I think there's some sense of realization that something is going to be developed there, and some shape, mean, and reform. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1222.369s">So</a> rather than preclude it and nix it and say, no, we don't want anything, let's be realistic, let's use some common sense, and let's just see how far they're willing to compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1230.312s">And</a> if they're not willing to compromise, then neither should you, and neither should the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1234.734s">Because</a> to me, I mean, you were there first, you pay the taxes first, you've lived through this, and you know what the neighborhood and the area can take. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1242.989s">much</a> more than anyone else, not even the developer knows that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1245.51s">He's</a> just going to build it and see you later and goodbye and make his money. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1248.951s">And</a> he's going to leave the problem for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1251.212s">No,</a> that's, that's exactly right.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1298.571s">And</a> you also have to look at the cut-through area <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1301.39s">by</a> that hospital section over there, because the neighborhood is going to take some of that impact.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2991.308s">Mr.</a> President, it's, um, it is a sad day for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2995.032s">Um,</a> I think Timmy was looked upon by his peers as not being a lesser in rank individual, but a person who basically set a tempo, his smile, his walk, his jog. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3007.544s">Um,</a> and he was, he was actively involved in this community and thought and process, um, comes from a good stock of family and God bless his mother. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3017.065s">Um,</a> at the wake, she was just tremendous. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3019.626s">And</a> I think she realized that God took him and now he's looking down and giving peace to his family. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3026.189s">And</a> unfortunately, um, it's the saddest part of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3030.091s">And</a> sometimes you just don't have the right word. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3031.832s">You</a> just don't know what to say, other than the fact that he was a good individual. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3035.454s">He</a> was a friend of mine and he's going to be missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3042.197s">Councilor</a> Marks.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3161.647s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3163.008s">Mr.</a> President, I think the resolution speaks volumes for Tufts University Athletic Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3169.974s">They</a> have quite an array of individuals up there who are winning championships. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3174.838s">But</a> this girl's softball team, some people may want to call it women's, some people want to call it girls. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3184.245s">Call</a> it what you may. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3185.787s">Bottom</a> line is they've won for three consecutive years in a row. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3189.763s">the</a> NCAA Division III Championship. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3194.507s">It's</a> a great feat. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3196.968s">We</a> have one of the players with us in the audience tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3200.291s">The</a> unfortunate part of getting them up here, a lot of these students are graduating or already have graduated and gone, left home. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3207.756s">But</a> maybe the young lady that's sitting in the audience can come up, say a few words, and accept the accolades of <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3214.92s">doing</a> your college proud, but you did our city of Medford proud, too, because Tufts University is part of our city of Medford.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3379.234s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3379.594s">Wish</a> you good luck.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3418.968s">Mr.</a> President, could we have a citation forwarded to the Tufts University Athletic Department, giving recognition to the girls receiving this award, and have that sent on a roll call vote, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4923.66s">First</a> of all, our charter as it presently sits is, you're right, it's approximately 30 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4931.284s">And</a> probably the biggest shortcoming in that charter is the fact that there was no review process to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4937.788s">As</a> in everything else in government, a review is necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4941.269s">We</a> as candidates are reviewed every two years when we're being voted on for office. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4946.552s">I</a> look at our city's charter <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4948.513s">is</a> to be the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4949.954s">It's</a> the future of this city as we're going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4952.414s">As</a> Mr. DiBenedetto indicated, you know, it's the city has changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4957.496s">It's</a> changed dramatically. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4959.737s">Dating</a> back to the plan E and the plan A form of government, the mayor did serve both as the chairperson then as he serves now on the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4968.52s">But</a> that may be something that may want to be reviewed at and looked at right now by folks within this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4974.365s">As</a> a candidate for mayor, one of the first things I will propose is to have the city auditor come under the control of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4981.649s">That</a> will present the checks and balances as to how the city administration spends its money and how it can't spend its money. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4988.793s">We</a> don't have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4990.313s">Unfortunately,</a> every single department comes under the control of the mayor as it presently stands in this particular charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4999.078s">What</a> councillors, whether you're for it or against it, some people like at large, <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5003.09s">Some</a> people like ward Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5004.89s">Again,</a> it's an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5005.851s">I</a> think after 30 years, people deserve to have that ability to look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5009.952s">Term</a> limits. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5011.112s">Do</a> we need term limits? <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5012.032s">Is</a> it fair to say, especially for the office of mayor, the term limits should only be two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5018.073s">Maybe</a> it should be a four, no more than two four-year terms. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5021.054s">And</a> maybe we should have staggered or proposed staggered city council terms, one, two, and three years, both city council and school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5028.135s">That</a> gives everybody an opportunity each and every year <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5030.941s">whether</a> they want to serve or whether they don't want to serve, but it keeps the people involved in the community as to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5038.447s">Also,</a> the fact that the mayor, under this form of government, does have an extended amount of power. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5045.552s">But</a> remember what the plan A charter says. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5047.493s">The</a> plan A charter says that the mayor is not required to meet with the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5053.418s">It</a> doesn't say he can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5054.999s">He's</a> not required to. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5056.8s">And</a> that would make a huge difference as to what I would be proposing. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5059.602s">I</a> would meet with this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5061.21s">when</a> and if asked, and that should be something that should be incorporated in the new proposal for the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5067.355s">Now,</a> the gentleman that talked about the affordable housing in the city of Medford, if anybody understands how you get to the affordable housing content, if a developer were to come into this community and propose 100 units, and only 25% of those units are for affordable housing, the city gets credit for all 100. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5085.048s">That's</a> the way this archaic 1939 law has been written. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5088.371s">That</a> needs to be changed in the legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5090.64s">This</a> city, I will say, has gone out of its way through its limited resources in the Office of Community Development to bring in as much affordable housing as they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5099.867s">And</a> even by adding on those other numbers at the very end, we still haven't been able to reach that 10% mark on new development for affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5109.095s">The</a> other parts I think that need to be looked upon is that not only the diversity that this community has, but where is the opportunity for the citizens of this community to know <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5120.331s">that</a> their government not only can be looked upon, it can be reviewed, but they don't have to wait for a four or a five-year period. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5127.293s">I</a> believe if I understand the law correctly and reviewing on the charters, you can have a five-year charter review, and if it incorporates a particular aspect of it, you don't have to go through that next five-year process to make that change. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5140.737s">And</a> I think in part that's what you're asking for with this resolution with the city solicitor to talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5146.078s">And</a> I think these are the things that need to be incorporated in the speaking of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5150.52s">But</a> the checks and balances just does not exist in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5155.801s">Now,</a> campaigning for this office, am I talking against myself by having the auditor not be on my side and on the council side? <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5162.483s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5163.083s">That's</a> just what good government's all about, having a good audit of your system on how your government works. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5168.625s">That's</a> the key to let you know that your government, your tax dollars are being spent wisely and correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5175.067s">This</a> is a hard job sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5176.727s">We</a> just got our budget here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5178.848s">And</a> unfortunately, in this budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5180.794s">that</a> we got, it's a combination of the prior budget director and the at present budget director. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5186.795s">And</a> in some occasions, one not talking to the other, as it relates to a particular thing that this council has asked for in each and every budget, the wishlist of each and every department head. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5196.597s">Give</a> us the wishlist, why you need it, how much it's going to cost, and how do you think you'd be able to get to that to pay for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5202.658s">And</a> we don't get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5203.718s">We</a> just get rank and file, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5206.418s">During</a> the past two years, we've seen increases in this city take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5210.163s">Last</a> year alone and last year's budget, the school department increased by $2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5214.626s">Absolutely</a> no conversation with the council about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5216.988s">There</a> was no concern as it related to rank and file teachers, books and students, but it was a lot went to administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5223.132s">But</a> just think about the school system we have here. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5225.634s">It</a> went for almost 50 plus years with having no rehabilitation. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5230.097s">And</a> during that course of the 50 years, the school system just deteriorated. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5233.973s">So</a> what did they do 12, 13 years ago? <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5235.674s">They</a> decided to build new buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5237.475s">And</a> yes, at that time, I was against the new buildings, because I felt we could rehab our old buildings one at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5243.659s">But</a> the city decided to go the other way, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5246.681s">Now,</a> as we Councilor Calderiello disclosed in his first term, these 12-year-old buildings are over in excess of $1 million in repairs that are needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5255.706s">They've</a> never taken the option <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5257.525s">that</a> the law has told them that 5% of the annual budget for each school needs to be put there for reconditioning, upgrading or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5266.572s">We're</a> hearing comments tonight in the meeting and we will be hearing it continuously in this budget of all the needs that need to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5272.957s">This</a> city needs to take a step back and look at where it's at, where it wants to go and understand that we have a brand new future that's in front of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5282.705s">The</a> opportunity is so unique for this city to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5285.571s">Forget</a> the mayor's office, which is a very important issue, but we have two openings here in the city council and you have two openings on the school department, the school committee, excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5295.519s">And</a> with that, this next election is going to bring a complete change in the philosophy of where this city of Medford by its government is going. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5304.406s">I</a> would love to be a part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5305.647s">I'd</a> love to have your vote, but I do support this charter vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5308.909s">And</a> I think this is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5310.791s">As</a> I said, as I said, right in the beginning, <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5312.706s">Probably</a> the biggest drawback, the biggest drawback was not including a review process. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5317.088s">But</a> let me remind you of one thing left. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5319.909s">When</a> that charter review committee came out back then, and even though the people voted for plan A, the vote also was to include plan E or plan A. My vote went both ways to allow the taxpayers the opportunity to have their choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5334.975s">They</a> made their choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5336.176s">They</a> voted for plan A. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5338.514s">Having</a> people, giving them transparency, giving them an opportunity, that's what this city needs right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5344.139s">And</a> with that thought, with that philosophy, we can go forward in this next election in November, and we can attain that, and we'll work for it, and we will correct it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=5352.407s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7026.798s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7027.919s">Mr.</a> President, some years ago, um, I think it was 2001 when the city finally got to the wall, because I think my resolutions dated back years before that the city went out of its way. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7041.184s">And</a> I believe we refurbished the wall that was falling down. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7045.852s">on</a> Governor's Avenue, and also I think they took out the trees that sort of like sat on the top of the walls almost five feet back, and that took some time because they believed Mr. Rumley had to go out and get insecure releases from the people who owned the property who abutted the top part of the wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7063.904s">Now,</a> if you go down there today, what you're going to look at is a complete distraction to the entire community's beautification over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7073.629s">Beside</a> the street being in a real tough condition, if you look at the wall and if you look at the sidewalk and if you look at all the brush that's growing and all the sand and the gravel that's on the sidewalks, which almost makes some part of it unwalkable, as a street that's a gateway into the city, it really needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7095.643s">This</a> is a perfect type of a project. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7098.553s">that</a> you could use summer help for, you would hire kids for the city, and you would pick out spots like that for them to go up there and clean. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7105.977s">Just</a> that brush that's up, that's growing on the bottom part of the street next to the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7111.481s">It's</a> even blocking at one point for anybody walking down the street on the sidewalk, especially if you have a doll carriage, a baby carriage, or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7118.725s">But</a> just the walking down there, the cement pieces, the sand, the gravel, and the street in and of itself, <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7126.336s">It</a> just doesn't do the city justice for spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on that wall and then to let it now run itself into a state of disrepair. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7133.92s">It's</a> almost like the same thing of building new schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7136.441s">Absolutely</a> no follow-up, no maintenance to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7138.703s">The</a> disrepair is taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7140.584s">Well,</a> that's what's happening right here on Governor's Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7143.926s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to move that to the Department of Public Works to get a response back to them as it relates to the cleanup <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7152.827s">the</a> removal of the brush, the overgrown brush, and the trees that are overhanging on that wall, all the length of Governor's Avenue, and have a report back, Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_ufxEwxM3_BY/2025-03-21_ufxEwxM3_BY.html">Medford City Council - May 26, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1884.548s">Mr.</a> President, members of the council, there was a lady out in the audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1887.709s">Um,</a> I believe she's going to address the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1890.401s">It's</a> another ongoing saga of what Republic, the parking company, has been doing in the city, the consternation it's been causing to business merchants within the community, and the fact that, if you can come up, the fact that this business is, and she'll be able to tell you herself, it's becoming less and less, it's almost to the point it's going to put her out of business, but I'll let her speak for herself.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2032.975s">Chris,</a> could you come to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2036.678s">How</a> long have you been doing business in Medford Square?

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2842.732s">One</a> of the issues that are equally of a concerning matter is the fact that the locality of the Method Public Library is the only public library in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2852.018s">Many,</a> many years ago, you had community-based area libraries. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2856.141s">The</a> high school library is closed on the weekends and nighttime, so the only library that you really have left is the Method Public Library. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2862.765s">And</a> for years, they had cut back hours on their employees, which cut back the hours of operations, if I think a few folks remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2869.837s">Some</a> of the days and the hours at night and on the weekends were cut back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2874.821s">One</a> of the things I forgot to mention when the last lady was up here speaking, I did get a complaint from a lady who went to the Method Public Library to return a book, to run in and to run out, and she got a $25 ticket to bring her book. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2887.771s">And</a> this takes us right back to what you had addressed a long time ago, Councilor Marks, I mean, where is this 30-minute supposedly free time you have when you pull up and getting ready to use these meters and what have you? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2899.655s">I</a> don't know why it's taken the Traffic Commission so long, but again, it was just as bad as putting it in front of the church when they first started this thing and they had to take them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2907.517s">Why</a> would you put something in front of a public library, an educational building, a community building? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2912.698s">It</a> just doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2913.798s">But</a> on the topic itself, it just makes... Report of information, Councilor Camuso.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2934.229s">Thank</a> you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2935.29s">The</a> fact of the matter is this lady just pulled up in the front of the house to go in and just drop off a book, and she didn't need to get a $25 ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2943.093s">And</a> if we all remember a few months ago, when there was a funeral going on at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2946.415s">Joseph's</a> Church, quite a few people got tickets there, and they had to be retaken back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2950.497s">So</a> again, it's just part of the whole program that really needs to be revisited, if not completely dumped.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3779.586s">Mr.</a> President, but more importantly, anybody who might be watching and Medford Square business folks, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3785.254s">The</a> situation regarding the Karatek Bridge is just an ongoing tale. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3789.396s">So</a> I think it's time to maybe have a little bit of a history lesson here as it relates to how did we get to the position we're in right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3797.36s">We</a> can go back to 2002, 02-2002-526, offered by Council Longo. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3803.423s">Be</a> it resolved that the Karatek Bridge be discussed in regards to public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3808.545s">And</a> there was a whole host of amendments as it related to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3810.826s">Now</a> that was in 2002, 13 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3814.935s">First</a> response from the state came back in 2006. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3817.116s">They</a> first sent a note back that basically says that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts will be taking a look and to review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3827.763s">Then</a> we go to 2011. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3829.364s">From</a> 2006 to 2011, there was absolutely nothing that took place that revolved around that particular bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3836.628s">At</a> that point in time in 2011, they said the cost of the bridge was going to be $2.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3840.671s">Then</a> in August of 2012, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3845.144s">it</a> jumped to $8.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3846.925s">And</a> then in April of 2013, it jumped up to $12.7 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3853.147s">And</a> at that meeting on April 13, on April, excuse me, of 2013, I had asked the question as it relates to mitigation for our downtown Medford business folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3864.31s">The</a> council voted seven to nothing on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3866.291s">As</a> a matter of fact, we got a letter of support from the Medford Chamber of Commerce on that particular issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3871.692s">Sent</a> the letter to the mayor and to the state, and to this date, still, absolutely nothing has come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3877.095s">From</a> April, we sent it again in May of 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3881.077s">June</a> of 2013, the cost then went down to $10.7 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3888.28s">And</a> now, again, on February of 2014, the question of mitigation came up, it was presented, and we still have no answer to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3896.344s">All</a> we know right now that we're getting a bridge <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3899.135s">that</a> supposedly are going to be starting at this point in time, sometime this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3905.037s">And</a> what doesn't make sense now, they're saying that on November 4th of 2018, the bridge will be completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3914.121s">But</a> during the summer of 2018, the bridge will be open for use. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3921.023s">So</a> how can you have something not completed and open for use or be completed in November of 2018? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3929.187s">And</a> that cost now is projected at $10.78 million for this particular bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3939.35s">We've</a> seen all kinds of correspondence from representatives in our city who are saying this is a wonderful thing, dating back to 2006, to 2012, to 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3952.654s">We've</a> received press releases from the mayor, from the senator in this community, that this bridge is such a wonderful thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3958.878s">You</a> know, they built the tunnel from France to England, which was, I believe, 21 miles in less than nine years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3966.244s">And</a> we have a bridge here starting in 2015 to be included by 2018, that's three years, to go 121 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3977.712s">Think</a> about it, 121 feet when you built the tunnel, which was 21 miles, and it was underwater. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3984.457s">This</a> whole thing, as far as I'm concerned, is the biggest slap in the face <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3988.356s">to</a> the Medford business community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3990.197s">And</a> the sad part about it, one of the gentlemen who's in charge of this project lives in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3994.958s">Now,</a> Councilor Dello Russo, I'm calling you on the carpet tonight because you indicated that you'd never received the letter dated February 24th, for which your name is on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4004.582s">Every</a> single one of our reps, our senators, our state, Paul Geer, Cassandra upstairs in the engineer's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4013.225s">And</a> I accepted you for your comment saying that you couldn't find it in your file. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4019.203s">But</a> it was convenient for you last week to get Eversource here just like that, when the conditions of the streets might be taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4026.785s">But</a> at the same time, this council has been asking, asking for you to go forward and call for this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4034.428s">And</a> there is no meeting here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4036.248s">But</a> there are public notices out there, and there are stanchions out there indicating that the bridge is going to start this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4043.253s">So</a> what clout you have, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4045.574s">What</a> clout this city has, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4048.075s">But</a> the more important part of where the clout all lies is this city council should be holding somebody to be accountable for the mitigation process that needs to take place on this, because businesses are going to be hurt, and some people might even go out of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4063.02s">It's</a> absolutely unfair that this project is going to start in the summer of 2015 and not be completed until November of 2018.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4111.25s">With</a> all due respect to my council colleague, that may be your interpretation, but nothing was ever definitively signed or put in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4118.071s">This</a> council asked to have that put in the RFP that went out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4121.392s">And</a> there are four people, there are four components to the people who are bidding on that bridge, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4125.433s">This</a> council asked that they come here and they apprise the city, the council, and the business community, and the Office of Community Development as it relates to the progress of that bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4134.898s">and</a> they never did it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4136.079s">The</a> only meeting that they ever had was, I believe, some three weeks ago at 10 o'clock on a Wednesday morning, for which certain councils couldn't go, a lot of people couldn't go, and it was just their staff meeting, if you want to come and see what it's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4148.793s">And</a> then they send you a press release, for which is put in the paper, that basically tells you that this is not going to be completed until 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4156.822s">So</a> if you forget all the gibberish that gets around to 2018, and then they acknowledge that the footings of the bridge, which have been there for 100 plus years, all they're going to do is reshore them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4166.49s">That</a> bridge is not sunk at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4168.632s">And</a> what they think they're building, the Taj Mahal, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4171.835s">They</a> don't need to build the Longfellow Bridge like they're building in Washington. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4175.578s">This</a> is a very simple bridge of 121 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4179.442s">Sure,</a> you want to make it adaptable for people, sidewalks and bikes, go right ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4183.667s">But</a> with the art of technology that's out there today, and for them to tell you it's going to take you a well over a year just to figure out what's underneath the bridge and move the lines and this and that, that is absolutely absurd. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4194.45s">Absolutely</a> absurd. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4195.49s">It's</a> probably the biggest snow job that this council and this city has gotten from the State Department of Public Transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4202.452s">And</a> we haven't even gotten to the issue of the bus routes and the changing of the bus routes and what's going to happen after that and once this bridge goes into construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4210.597s">Mr.</a> President, I'm asking once again, I'm asking you to call the Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4214.178s">Department</a> of Transportation, have them come before this council, and have them explain if what Councilor Camuso was saying is correct, that they are not going to give us mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4222.7s">Point</a> of information? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4224.261s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuso.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4252.508s">Well,</a> I'm going to respectfully disagree with my colleague because state agencies and state departments do pay mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4257.611s">And</a> if they're asked to do it, they do do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4259.713s">The</a> biggest one out there right now is the MWRA. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4262.014s">They'll</a> give you mitigation before they even start a project because they have to realize the length and the strength of their pipes.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4304.267s">Well,</a> I'm responsible for what I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4305.707s">And</a> what I know is this, that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts does and can, if the city of Medford is going to be impacted to such a degree and businesses are going to be displaced for a period of time such as that, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4315.791s">When</a> you have your own Chamber of Commerce, and when you have an entire city council, and when you've been talking about this since 2013, and went out since 2015, and there is nothing, no acknowledgement, no public hearing, no public meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4328.536s">It's</a> a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4329.556s">And</a> if you think they're doing a good job by taking this bridge over and cutting down the amount of time that it's going to take, or not to take, it's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4337.138s">It's</a> not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4337.998s">This</a> is not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4339.198s">This</a> does not speak well for a governmental project and a governmental agency. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4343.359s">And</a> more importantly, how can you go and start with $2 million, go as high as $12 million, bring it back to $10 million? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4351.04s">They</a> can't even figure out what the actual cost is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4353.78s">And</a> the total disruption is going to be when they put that ramp in Medford Square, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4357.672s">and</a> shutting off one of the ramps coming off Route 93, there's going to be a complete fiasco. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4363.016s">We</a> still haven't seen the final product. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4365.378s">It</a> still hasn't been presented to the business people, the Chamber of Commerce, or this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4371.463s">And</a> that, to me, is what this whole system, this whole project is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4376.407s">Absolutely</a> no transparency at all.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4412.88s">The</a> meeting took place on the 18th of July, 2013, and it took place at the Century Bank and Trust on Mystic Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4421.442s">The</a> time that came over here, his name was Billy something. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4424.003s">He</a> appeared here from Medford and his other person. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4427.924s">That's</a> what took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4429.164s">And</a> that meeting, we were told, as a matter of fact, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4432.06s">I</a> have Mr. Davey's private personal number because at that particular night, in that particular meeting, they were trying to shut me off. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4438.803s">I'm</a> asking him a very important question as to why this meeting was not being held here in Medford and where is the mitigation as it relates to the concern that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4447.027s">If</a> you're not going to give us mitigation, what are you going to give for the business community? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4450.689s">Don't</a> tell me you're going to pay for the disruption or the destruction to their product. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4454.143s">Of</a> course they would have to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4455.304s">That's</a> common sense tells you that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4456.985s">But</a> don't come in here and do a project and totally disrupt the entire community, the downtown area. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4461.568s">You</a> have bus routes, you can have people completely confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4464.63s">Can</a> anyone in this council turn around and explain what's going to go on? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4467.932s">Can</a> you tell me where the bus routes are going to go? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4469.413s">Pardon</a> me?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4481.974s">Point</a> of clarification, point of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4483.836s">He</a> wants to make representative to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4485.437s">My</a> point is they belong before the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4487.899s">I</a> don't want to do something and the public belongs to hear what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4491.201s">And</a> that's what the council called for. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4492.643s">If</a> he wants to go on his own, good luck to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4494.484s">I</a> want him to come before here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4495.945s">This</a> is a city of Medford project.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4540.581s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4542.882s">It's</a> got absolutely nothing to do with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4544.483s">He's</a> talking about apples and oranges. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4545.944s">It's</a> got nothing to do with this particular issue.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4549.886s">It's</a> your fictitious mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4551.667s">This</a> has nothing to do with this issue.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4591.421s">It's</a> right here, Councilor, and it's right here.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4716.537s">Councilor</a> Camuso just referred to the Rose Kennedy Garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4718.798s">The</a> Rose Kennedy Garden was an afterthought. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4720.839s">It</a> was going to be a greenway. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4722.54s">The</a> Rose Kennedy Garden came in after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4724.621s">That</a> was part of the mitigation and the rehabilitation because of the damage and the construction that took place in the artery.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4940.767s">First</a> of all, as it relates to the bus stop, whether it's being moved over the bridge or, as some of us were led to believe, it might be moved to Medford Square, we were supposed to be getting a report back from the T that would indicate where that bus stop was going to be moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4957.939s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4958.62s">The</a> other gentleman who came here that night, his name was Paul King, and he was the project manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4963.964s">He</a> also indicated, for which they have now changed their times from the days and the night shifts as to when <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4970.693s">working</a> hours are going to take place, which is a change from what was written on January 21st, 2015, as compared to the most recent one on May 20th of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4983.196s">And</a> again, once again, none of the businesses are aware of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4986.397s">So</a> there is a, and the request by the council was to have them here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4990.638s">You</a> know, I'm not going to get hung up on the legality of a hearing or a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4995.02s">It's</a> a request. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4996.78s">And</a> if the request to have a state agency or somebody come here, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5000.42s">to</a> explain what their project is about, then they should honor the request, either in writing or what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5006.782s">You</a> said, Councilor Dello Russo, when I gave you the letter that you said you couldn't find and you never got, you went to the city clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5013.005s">The</a> city clerk supposedly called them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5016.146s">Never</a> got a response, did you, Mr. Clerk? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5018.447s">So</a> that's a great way to have, and he called not once, but he called twice. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5021.988s">It's</a> a great way for a state agency to act on behalf of a community that has a major project going through it, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5028.45s">And</a> we're worried about allegedly a legality from a hearing to a request to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5034.018s">That's</a> absolutely nonsense. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5036.281s">Councilor</a> Knight.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5478.271s">Again,</a> there are subcontractors, as Council Marks has alluded to, that are going to be responsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5484.295s">The</a> main contractor here, the signer of the contract is the Massachusetts Department of Transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5488.657s">That's</a> the main contractor for the bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5490.758s">But</a> you've got Spectra Energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5492.259s">You've</a> got National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5493.439s">You</a> also even have the city of Medford involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5494.98s">You</a> have the Massachusetts State Police. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5496.541s">You</a> have the State Department of Conservation and Recreation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5499.703s">And</a> there are other little subcontractors involved in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5502.744s">So</a> I am not going to turn around and say mitigation is not a possibility when, in fact, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5507.703s">It</a> could be a possibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5509.304s">And</a> as far as the meeting goes today, it's another clear-cut example of this council being shut out on any types of meetings such as that, especially when they had a personal interest in this, especially on behalf of the Metro business folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5521.875s">And</a> we've been discussing this for months upon months upon months, and not to be even notified about a meeting to go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5529.602s">It's</a> just wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5530.743s">And</a> that's where the whole sense of frustration comes about, a complete lack of transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5535.473s">And</a> that's how mixed messages get sent around, not only to this building, but to the businesses within this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5541.695s">Hopefully,</a> pretty soon, there'll be a major change in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5544.717s">And</a> this will not go on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5545.877s">This</a> will not be tolerated.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6416.422s">Councilor</a> Panto. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6417.202s">Just</a> on that point, I'm glad you just brought that up because I was alluding to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6420.603s">When</a> we built our new school buildings, they've gone on 13 years now, if not more, the 5% on an annual basis was supposed to be each school budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6429.725s">The</a> state never came in here to monitor that, to see if it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6433.686s">Now,</a> Councilor Caraviello, on the second year of his term, in year two, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6437.61s">brought</a> up a report that had $1,200,000 of repairs for the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6440.093s">Isn't</a> that correct, sir? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6440.994s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6441.474s">$1,200,000</a> for schools were no more, at that point in time, maybe 12 years old, 10, 11, 12 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6444.838s">And</a> we're worried about <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6452.666s">a</a> new police station and making sure that it's going to be rehabbed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6455.889s">Look</a> up at the ceiling there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6456.85s">You</a> see that ceiling right there? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6458.151s">I</a> do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6458.411s">That's</a> been like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6459.272s">You</a> know how long? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6460.553s">That's</a> been going on almost three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6462.754s">And</a> the superintendent of the schools is sitting exactly where the gentleman is sitting there when that ceiling came down, and he's lucky he didn't get killed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6468.98s">This</a> is what the city's idea of maintenance is right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6472.322s">Cover</a> the hole up, patch it up, and maybe nothing will be said. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6475.465s">You</a> heard it tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6476.186s">You</a> heard about the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6477.146s">You</a> heard about the bathrooms, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6479.248s">You</a> go through the infrastructure of our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6481.853s">There</a> were just so many things that for the past many years have been ignored, completely and totally ignored, whitewashed over. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6489.639s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6490.559s">Because</a> you know why? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6491.6s">Because</a> at all these bonds that the city has outstanding there, they're all going to be paid on a back end. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6497.685s">So</a> it's interest only for the first five or six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6501.167s">God</a> bless whoever the next mayor is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6503.529s">And</a> I hope I have a chance to do this because I want to revitalize that whole situation on how <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6509.582s">this</a> city is going to pay for those bonds in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6512.723s">Do</a> you realize on the fifth and the sixth year what the cost is going to be in this particular budget to pay for those bonds? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6518.165s">You</a> won't see any new buildings in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6519.745s">You'll</a> just be paying off for the bonds that you have here right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6524.327s">So</a> what needs to take place here is a thorough and an exhaustive review of how these buildings are going to be reviewed, how these buildings are going to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6533.983s">This</a> past year, the school department budget passed $2 million additional dollars from last year to this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6540.626s">God</a> knows what they have in it for this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6542.827s">Salaries</a> increased, as the councilor to my right, Councilor Lungo-Koehn and current. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6546.368s">Some</a> people got $20,000 salary increases, and I believe there was almost $32 million in transfers from last year's budget before the end of the year took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6557.013s">So</a> how are we talking about that being a legitimate budget when you pass it in the beginning of the year? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6561.315s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6562.266s">These</a> are all tricks of the trade, apparently, that have been going on for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6565.947s">But</a> if you have, all of a sudden, $2 million in additional dollars, and you start hiring extra people at $90,000 and $100,000 a year, and you take it away from the classroom, you take it away from the teachers, you take it away from the supplies, and you take it away from the front entrance of that high school, it looks like it's bombed out, like a war zone, because the bricks and everything are shattered. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6584.972s">I'm</a> surprised there are enough kids that have not broken their ankles or their legs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6588.493s">Handles</a> still off the front door to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6591.154s">That's</a> wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6592.32s">And</a> when the parent goes up there and looks at it and says, is that where I'm going to send my kid? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6596.242s">Do</a> I really want my kid to go there? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6598.484s">That's</a> why they get forced to go to these private schools, because appearance, as you know, is the name of the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6606.108s">They</a> spent $500,000 to redo this building over, just this council chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6610.591s">I</a> think it cost $497,000 to build the entire building, PWA days. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6613.252s">But</a> $500,000 to do this over. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6618.139s">That's</a> been like that for three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6619.46s">And</a> then the molding, if you look at the molding, that's ready to go and that's coming down and nothing's been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6624.064s">Nothing</a> in the budget, no repair work, no nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6626.446s">And</a> y'all worried about a police station and they can't even figure out how to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6632.271s">The</a> next administration hopefully will be a work in composite between the council and the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6638.276s">And</a> there's going to be a meeting of the minds. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6640.363s">And</a> so that way there, when the money is going to be spent, it's going to be spent, and everybody's going to be on board to understand how it's going to be spent, when it's going to be spent, and where it's going to be spent for. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6649.267s">That</a> hasn't taken place here in 28 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6651.808s">But</a> I can assure you, it will take place.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6688.225s">Mr.</a> President, as a result of, unfortunately the merger that did not take place between partners and Lawrence Memorial hospital and the Melrose Wakefield on January 29th of this past year, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6699.415s">when</a> the judge, Judge Sanders, issued her 48-page decision not agreeing to this because she did not believe that what Martha Coakley had put together was going to work in the best interests of the hospitals mentioned in as well as offshore. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6714.084s">And</a> then on top of that, Martha Healy, Maura Healy, the new attorney general coming in and likewise not only supporting the judge, but nixing the whole deal and was willing and is willing to go to court. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6728.471s">I</a> believe we have a council resolution asking her and both parties to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6733.034s">I've</a> taken the time to speak to some doctors and some employees up at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6740.199s">And</a> since at the present time, the third and the fourth floor of the hospital is not being used to any type of its potential, never mind its maximum, I'd like to make an offering and throw this back out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6751.928s">And</a> hopefully it gets back to not only the Lawrence Memorial, but to partners, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6756.21s">If</a> we take a look at the doctors that are operating here in the city of Medford that are Hallmark Hospital doctors and at the same time private practitioners, and offer them room and space on the third and fourth floor of the hospital, and leaving the first and second floors available for emergency, for prompt care, emergency services, and what's presently in there right now, it would be a way not only to utilize the hospital <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6781.222s">with</a> a complete medical density of doctors, no matter what their professions might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6786.966s">And</a> at the same time, make the offering to partners, rather than have the Lawrence be part of a consortium, which included the South Shore, which included Melrose-Wakefield. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6797.333s">It</a> could be an independent, isolated medical facility that the partners, Mass General, would be willing to entertain, which would not have to go through any type of a consortium, or a review, or to go through a <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6811.896s">48-page</a> review. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6813.857s">People</a> don't realize that the Lawrence Memorial Hospital was in a profit-making position before this whole idea of this merger took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6822.263s">And</a> for the last few years, a lot of its finances and a lot of its profits have been carried over to the Melrose-Wakefield. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6829.347s">And</a> unfortunately for the Lawrence Memorial, they did not receive the same benefits that the Melrose-Wakefield Hospital has received most recently over the past two to three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6839.738s">And</a> that's maybe because the former president, who's no longer the president, who left the day after the deal didn't go through, did not have the same feeling to the Lawrence Memorial as he had as being president over at the Melrose-Wakefield. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6853.664s">But</a> I think this would really bode well for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6856.285s">I</a> think it would bode well for our citizens, seniors, mothers with babies, emergency room, prompt care locations, and for any other doctor that might be having a situation where <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6867.362s">either</a> parking presents itself with a problem, location presents itself with a problem, but if they were all centrally located, because everybody knows where the Lawrence Memorial Hospital is, and if they were centrally located there, and they worked their offices out of that building, and even if they looked at the positioning that the doctors, to some degree, are not part of the nonprofit, and there is a way to legally separate the buildings or the floors or what have you, because anything is possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6893.027s">So</a> that's why I'm throwing this out there as a possibility <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6896.124s">to</a> keep as many doctors as we can here, but also the greater possibility to bring Mass General partners here into the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6903.45s">They</a> have a great interest in Mr. Cardiology. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6906.092s">They</a> think it's a great team of doctors that are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6908.894s">They</a> were one of the first, if not the first group of doctors that partners, I believe, entertain for the purposes of hopefully being part of this consortium. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6916.721s">But</a> again, unfortunately on January 29th when the deal did not go through and Judge Sanders didn't approve it because she felt that for which Martha Coakley <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6924.775s">had</a> put in her request for the merger that the cost would not be contained, as they said it would be for a six-year period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6933.837s">And</a> as a result of that, I believe there were 50 independent doctors and medical professionals and presidents of other hospitals, local area hospitals, who did not want it, did not believe it would serve in the best interest of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6946.241s">And</a> I believe that's the reason why. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6947.461s">That's</a> what the 48-page decision says. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6951.275s">So,</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I move, Mr. Clerk, and I don't know if the words are going to be very probably general right now, that the Lawrence Memorial Hospital look at entertaining the utilization of their third and fourth floor locations for the purposes of offering to all Medford doctors an opportunity to house their private practices there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6982.986s">in</a> concert with the first and second, with the emergency and prompt care, the other medical facilities that the Lawrence Memorial offers now, and present that to the Partners Mass General Board, our president.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7007.998s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7008.778s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7009.799s">For</a> the purposes of presenting to the Hallmark Health, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7014.373s">in</a> essence, and may present that to partners, Mass General, for the purposes of being an independent affiliate of the Mass General and not part of the original consortium. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7029.476s">Do</a> you have it, Eddie? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7030.756s">You</a> may have to go back and watch the video.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7044.962s">Not</a> with homelike help, but speaking with their doctors, nurses, and as well as patients who thought it was a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7050.323s">But</a> doctors and nurses, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7053.104s">So</a> that's a negative.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7074.597s">On</a> that motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7075.437s">Roll</a> call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7075.998s">Mr.</a> President and have that forwarded to the hallmark board of directors to be forwarded to home, uh, to be forwarded to a partners mass general.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7135.16s">On</a> the motion, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7138.182s">I</a> am absolutely perplexed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7140.064s">You</a> and Councilor Knight are both offering these resolutions, but when this was presented over here for the purposes of possibly entertaining it by Mr. Stirello, the both of you were opposed to it, and now all of a sudden you're for it, and the people who had an opportunity to speak on it aren't even here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7155.536s">I</a> respectfully request that I lay on the table <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7158.345s">And</a> anyone interested who might be watching can come next week to discuss this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7161.608s">Because</a> I think this is way too important of an issue to not have the public either be advised of it, but I'm just dumbfounded that people who are against it now want to get an opinion when you didn't want to do it back then.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7177.4s">But</a> you refused the gentleman when he came before, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7180.542s">So</a> what changed your mind?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7373.731s">Point</a> of clarification.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7376.833s">Is</a> the Council's sense saying that there is a — when the — at present administration, there was a security sense here, but now there is a sense of insecurity?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7390.182s">Well,</a> that's even worse.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7406.723s">I</a> really think the people of this community are smart enough to understand and to realize that when this issue has been brought up, as it has been brought up, and I really am going to respectfully ask my colleagues to lay it on the table so that way the people who are watching it can come next week and discuss it, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7421.693s">And</a> I think, Councilor De La Rosa, you owe it to the public to come down from the chair and explain why you're putting this resolution on when you were wholeheartedly against it before. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7428.819s">Because</a> this doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7431.001s">You</a> have to stand behind that for what you're proffering. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7433.623s">You</a> just can't turn around and put a resolution on and not tell the people why. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7437.266s">This</a> is such a huge, huge issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7439.968s">You're</a> talking about the community's charter that you were diabolically opposed to before. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7445.291s">Now</a> all of a sudden, out of the clear blue sky, and I don't know who put this bug in your ear, to have this resolution come before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7454.012s">If</a> you're that much for it, well, then why don't you just have the city solicitor come forward and just tell him, Mr. Solicitor, there seems to be a feeling in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7463.197s">Could</a> you just come here and explain it? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7465.778s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7466.459s">I</a> don't think you thought this up on your own, because that would be just too good to be true. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7470.561s">The</a> fact of the matter is, you sat there, and you were against it, same as he was, and same as Councilor Camuso.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7479.726s">God.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7482.068s">He</a> moved that the paper lay on the table and allow the people to come next week who have an interest on this particular subject matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7488.753s">You</a> had an 80 year old gentleman who was walking the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7492.817s">It</a> basically embarrassed them and insulted them at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7498.501s">No,</a> no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7500.503s">He</a> said things were all right the way they were to me.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7514.924s">It</a> is a good thing, but I just want to know why. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7516.745s">Why</a> the change?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7528.847s">Why</a> are you afraid to let people come and talk on it?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7537.313s">Are</a> you withdrawing the motion to table? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7538.514s">No,</a> there's people who want to talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7539.674s">I</a> don't want to talk.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7553.841s">Undebatable</a> motion is tabled.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7677.873s">What's</a> the first dates again, please.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8146.226s">Just</a> a point. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8147.307s">Is</a> there a motion on the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8148.787s">Point</a> of clarification to those meetings, uh, um, Tony, um, when we were at those meetings, one of the things that were brought up, that was pretty much not clear because a lot of people didn't go back to 30 years when this whole change of government took place way back when it wasn't just a one option issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8169.134s">It</a> was a double option. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8170.234s">You</a> could retain the council manager, former government, or you could go forward with the strong AMIA and, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8177.085s">A</a> lot of people seem to think that that wasn't the way it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8179.687s">We</a> had 32 meetings, 32 meetings, open to the public, open and notorious. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8185.551s">And</a> then we had, I believe there was a Charter Review Committee, and then there became a Charter Commission, was elected citywide throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8193.418s">And</a> then, I believe it's some year after that, it's a four to five year process. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8198.402s">This</a> isn't an overnight thing, and people think it's gonna change overnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8202.105s">This</a> is open and notorious. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8203.546s">There</a> were many, many meetings, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8205.27s">And</a> if you digest each and every part of the segments of the charter, that's what this thing was all about, and that's where it was going. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8211.592s">The</a> unfortunate part, even though the vote was four to three, the unfortunate part about many good things were starting to come about. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8218.174s">And</a> I think all we were looking for, all that I guess you guys were looking for at the time, and I was willing to support, was having each council become involved with a citizen, with a committee, and going over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8230.919s">And</a> then when the time came to make a presentation, you make a presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8234.559s">That's</a> all that it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8235.54s">This</a> wasn't trying to upstage anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8237.981s">And</a> you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8238.801s">This</a> wasn't out there to smash anybody or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8241.702s">It</a> was run very logically and very, very courteously. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8245.504s">People</a> expressed their opinions as what they wanted to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8248.885s">And</a> again, I just, you know, I still think there are other people out there who would like to come and speak on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8255.328s">And</a> just all due respect to my colleagues, I just ask that it lay on the table until next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8259.67s">And</a> at least that way, there are people, if they want to come, they come. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8263.005s">At</a> least they had an opportunity to know it's there.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8290.234s">And</a> just like the US Constitution when it was passed, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8293.003s">It</a> was very marginal on each one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8295.465s">Many</a> of them were 5 to 4, 6 to 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8297.687s">There</a> weren't many that were really overwhelming. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8300.068s">And</a> you're going to probably find this on this particular issue, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8302.55s">But</a> you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8303.791s">This</a> charter to be looked at today is going to be for the benefit of the citizens of tomorrow, for the people who are 20, 30, and 40 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8310.696s">I</a> mean, we're at an age right now, you know, we're living within something that's already there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8314.619s">It's</a> been established. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8316.405s">But</a> whoever the administrator, and whoever the new council's gonna be, your job isn't for today, your job is how, where this city's gonna be going for tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8323.648s">It's</a> direction, and how are we gonna enhance the vitality and rejuvenate this city to a point that's saying, hey, our government is working with us and it's moving forward with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8332.711s">And</a> Jeannie, whether it's a brand new police station or not, how we're gonna get there, that's what you need to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8338.193s">How</a> it's gonna be financed, that's what you need to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8340.833s">You</a> just can't say you want something. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8342.614s">This</a> is how we're gonna do it, and it's gonna be collective, it'll be a collective <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8345.562s">that</a> it'll be a cleft of thought process to get to that point, something that's been sort of like missing for a long period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8351.785s">And</a> hopefully the new council, whoever those Councilors might be, will realize that you do have an important role to play in this city and you're not going to be ostracized and you should be a game player for the future, just like the mayor is going to be a game player for the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8365.931s">You</a> know, we're elected to do the people's business. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8367.832s">We're</a> not elected here to be for ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8371.034s">There's</a> no personal gain in here for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8372.995s">I'll</a> speak for myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8374.509s">I</a> love this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8375.189s">I've</a> spent a lot of time in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8377.05s">I've</a> been elected for a lot of years, and I'm very thankful to the taxpayers for that and the rate payers and the citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8383.033s">But</a> you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8383.934s">This</a> is a new day dawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8385.335s">We're</a> moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8386.235s">We're</a> going into a new direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8388.036s">And</a> that's hopefully, I hope the taxpayers buy into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8390.917s">Collaboration</a> breeds success. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8392.378s">Yes,</a> it's collaboration. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8393.299s">You're</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8393.679s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8692.514s">Mr.</a> President, um, I'm going to apologize to you because, um, I think we've seen it and heard enough here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8700.739s">I</a> understand when you come out, you know what I'm going to ask you to do if you don't mind, would you just withdraw your motion and put it legitimately on the agenda for next week? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8707.903s">And</a> then that way there it's open and notorious and then everybody can discuss it because I think it can accomplish the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8714.147s">And</a> at the same time, it's just such an important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8718.317s">to</a> have it come under suspension of the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8719.978s">I</a> just think, can I, can I explain why I did what I did?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8739.069s">And</a> I appreciate that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8762.373s">And</a> I can appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8763.293s">But</a> at the same time, it's such, it's, it's, it's the thing that makes this city run. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8767.475s">It's,</a> it's charter and you know, and if it was on the agenda, there'd be no, I'd have no problem with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8772.057s">I'm</a> just, you know, it just reflects me back to the 43 vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8776.28s">You</a> have to understand, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8777.639s">You're</a> in one position and I'm in another. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8779.52s">But</a> I think we're on the same page as far as getting an opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8782.501s">So</a> that's what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8784.001s">If</a> you don't mind withdrawing it and just putting it on the agenda for next week, I would be more than happy with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8788.243s">That</a> would be OK.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8797.527s">Well,</a> because there are other people who were actively involved that might want to come and speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8801.488s">And</a> I want them to have an opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8803.389s">Under</a> suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8805.53s">Under</a> suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8807.204s">It's</a> not on the agenda, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8808.505s">I</a> understand that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8816.911s">But</a> at the same time, but at the same time, Freddy, if I lay it on the table and it wins, it sits there for another week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8822.175s">But</a> if it's on the agenda next week, it doesn't make any difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8825.557s">At</a> least it's open. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8826.498s">People</a> can see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8827.298s">I'll</a> withdraw it and place it on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8829.84s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8831.001s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8831.601s">I</a> appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8832.602s">Motion</a> is withdrawn.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8920.43s">Wait</a> a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8923.512s">Oh,</a> they remain on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8926.034s">One</a> last thing, in all seriousness. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8928.335s">I</a> want my council colleagues to call me, because I am really impassioned about this issue regarding achata. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8936.36s">So</a> I want to apologize to you, because I just was looking at you as being probably a naysayer back then. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8944.695s">And</a> I can understand where you're coming from now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8946.616s">Same</a> thing with Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8947.816s">He</a> was dead set against it, but that's beside the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8950.198s">The</a> fact of the matter is, um, you're the one that's standing up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8952.979s">So</a> I apologize, but I thank you for withdrawing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8955.48s">And</a> I thank you for putting it on the agenda next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8957.741s">To</a> me, it's probably the most important thing that makes the city run. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8960.742s">It's</a> charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8962.863s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8963.204s">Councilor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8963.724s">You're</a> welcome.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_50f-AMbGHtg/2025-03-21_50f-AMbGHtg.html">Medford City Council - May 26, 2015</a></h2>

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1879.829s">Mr.</a> President, members of the Council, there is a lady out in the audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1883.17s">I</a> believe she's going to address the Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1885.691s">It's</a> another ongoing saga of what Republic, the parking company, has been doing in the city, the consternation it's been causing to business merchants within the community, and the fact that, if you can come up, the fact that this business is, and she'll be able to tell you herself, it's becoming less and less, it's almost to the point it's going to put her out of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1907.216s">But</a> I'll let her speak for herself.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2028.402s">Chris,</a> could you come to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2032.104s">How</a> long have you been doing business in Medford Square?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2039.289s">And</a> I thank you for coming forward and presenting the signatures of individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2043.892s">And</a> one of the complaints that you just talked about is something that Councilor Caraviello mentioned way back when, that nobody can read the screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2050.437s">It's</a> the blur of the sun. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2052.172s">whatever</a> it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2053.393s">Again,</a> this past week, over and beyond your situation, two more people, one in particular, and I have pictures right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2061.58s">They</a> still have kiosks in High Street in front of residential homes that were supposed to have been taken out months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2068.225s">The</a> snow has been gone for a long period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2070.947s">They're</a> still there, and people crazily are trying to put money into a machine in front of a two-filming house that they shouldn't have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2077.913s">And</a> then at the same time, <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2080.64s">co-worker,</a> a co-business friend of yours in the West Method area, a girl had to get off the chair with her rollers in her hair to go and put money in the meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2088.964s">And</a> she couldn't even put the money in the same meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2091.105s">She</a> had to find another spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2092.346s">That's</a> how crazy this whole system is. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2094.607s">You</a> know, I think it's Mr. Ruggieri, he's still out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2097.808s">He's</a> been very helpful on this, on dissecting and getting into the contract, as well as myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2102.911s">I</a> believe that there's approximately nine infractions that they have committed. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2107.485s">And</a> of course, the city has enacted upon it. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2109.147s">Why,</a> I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2109.928s">But</a> all I can tell you is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2113.831s">As</a> a candidate for mayor, that's going to be the first thing I am going to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2117.354s">Those</a> kiosks and the damage that it's doing here to the merchants and the entire city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2123.02s">So</a> I thank you for bringing that forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2124.101s">I</a> think it'll be much appreciated.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2176.12s">It</a> was just discussed.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2458.62s">On</a> the last paragraph, where the word utilize is, strike the word utilize and change it adhere to all. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2466.805s">That</a> makes it mandatory that they have to conform to all our city and metro regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2472.768s">Utilize</a> is subjective.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2838.949s">One</a> of the issues that are equally of a concerning matter is the fact that the locality of the Method Public Library is the only public library in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2848.233s">Many,</a> many years ago, you had community-based area libraries. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2852.354s">The</a> high school library is closed on the weekends and nighttime. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2855.416s">So</a> the only library that you really have left is the Method Public Library. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2858.989s">And</a> for years, they had cut back hours on their employees, which cut back the hours of operations, if I think a few folks remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2866.074s">Some</a> of the days and the hours at night and on the weekends were cut back. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2871.058s">One</a> of the things I forgot to mention when the last lady was up here speaking, I did get a complaint from a lady who went to the Method Public Library to return a book, to run in and to run out. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2881.025s">And</a> she got a $25 ticket to bring her book. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2884.007s">And</a> this takes us right back to what you had addressed a long time ago, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2887.469s">I</a> mean, where is this? <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2889.148s">30-minute,</a> supposedly, free time you have when you pull up and getting ready to use these meters and what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2895.911s">I</a> don't know what's taking the Traffic Commission so long. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2897.952s">But</a> again, it was just as bad as putting it in front of the church when they first started this thing and they had to take them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2903.774s">Why</a> would you put something in front of a public library, an educational building, a community building? <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2908.976s">It</a> just doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2910.077s">But</a> on the topic itself, it just makes-. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2912.678s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2931.576s">The</a> fact of the matter is this lady just pulled up in the front of the house to go in and just drop off a book, and she didn't need to get a $25 certificate, I mean, ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2939.399s">And</a> if we all remember a few months ago, when there was a funeral going on at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2942.721s">Joseph's</a> Church, quite a few people got tickets there, and they had to be retaken back. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2946.787s">So</a> again, it's just part of the whole program that really needs to be revisited, if not completely dumped.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=3776.686s">Mr.</a> President, but more importantly, anybody who might be watching in Medford Square business folks, <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=3782.352s">The</a> situation regarding the Karatek Bridge is just an ongoing tale. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=3786.493s">So</a> I think it's time to maybe have a little bit of a history lesson here as it relates to how did we get to the position we're in right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=3794.455s">We</a> can go back to 2002, 02-2002-526, offered by Council Longo, be it resolved that the Karatek Bridge be discussed in regards to public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=3805.658s">And</a> there was a whole host of amendments as it related to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=3807.939s">Now</a> that was in 2002, 13 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=3812.026s">The</a> first response from the state came back in 2006. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=3814.247s">They</a> first sent a note back that basically says that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts will be taking a look and to review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=3824.911s">Then</a> we go to 2011. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=3826.492s">From</a> 2006 to 2011, there was absolutely nothing that took place that revolved around that particular bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=3833.775s">At</a> that point in time in 2011, they said the cost of the bridge was going to be $2.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=3837.816s">Then</a> in August of 2012, <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=3842.292s">it</a> jumped to $8.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=3844.092s">And</a> then in April of 2013, it jumped up to $12.7 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=3850.314s">And</a> at that meeting on April 13th, on April, excuse me, of 2013, I had asked the question as it relates to mitigation for our downtown Medford business folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=3861.476s">The</a> council voted seven to nothing on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=3863.456s">As</a> a matter of fact, we got a letter of support from the Medford Chamber of Commerce on that particular issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=3868.873s">Sent</a> the letter to the mayor and to the state, and to this date, still, absolutely nothing has come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=3874.295s">From</a> April, we sent it again in May of 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=3878.257s">June</a> of 2013, the cost then went down to $10.7 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=3885.46s">And</a> now, again, on February of 2014, the question of mitigation came up. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=3890.222s">It</a> was presented, and we still have no answer to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=3893.543s">All</a> we know right now that we're getting a bridge <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=3896.353s">that's</a> supposedly going to be starting at this point in time, sometime this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=3902.257s">And</a> what doesn't make sense now, they're saying that on November 4th of 2018, the bridge will be completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=3911.344s">But</a> during the summer of 2018, the bridge will be open for use. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=3918.249s">So</a> how can you have something not completed and open for use or be completed in November of 2018? <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=3926.259s">And</a> that cost now is projected at $10.78 million for this particular bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=3936.587s">We've</a> seen all kinds of correspondence from representatives in our city who are saying this is a wonderful thing, dating back to 2006, to 2012, to 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=3949.917s">We've</a> received press releases from the mayor, from the senator in this community, that this bridge is such a wonderful thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=3956.142s">You</a> know, they built the tunnel from France to England, which was, I believe, 21 miles in less than nine years. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=3963.527s">And</a> we have a bridge here starting in 2015 to be included by 2018, that's three years, to go 121 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=3974.994s">Think</a> about it, 121 feet when you built the tunnel, which was 21 miles, and it was underwater. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=3981.738s">This</a> whole thing, as far as I'm concerned, is the biggest slap in the face <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=3985.656s">to</a> the Medford business community. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=3987.478s">And</a> the sad part about it, one of the gentlemen who's in charge of this project lives in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=3992.261s">Now,</a> Councilor Dello Russo, I'm calling you on the carpet tonight because you indicated that you'd never received the letter dated February 24th, of which your name is on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4001.889s">Every</a> single one of our reps, our senators, our state, Paul Geer, Cassandra upstairs in the engineer's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4010.557s">And</a> I accepted you for your comment saying that you couldn't find it in your file. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4016.517s">But</a> it was convenient for you last week to get Eversource here just like that, when the conditions of the streets might be taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4024.12s">But</a> at the same time, this council has been asking, asking for you to go forward and call for this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4031.764s">And</a> there is no meeting here. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4033.585s">But</a> there are public notices out there, and there are stanchions out there indicating that the bridge is going to start this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4040.604s">So</a> what clout you have, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4042.925s">What</a> clout this city has, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4045.425s">But</a> the more important part of where the clout all lies is this city council should be holding somebody to be accountable for the mitigation process that needs to take place on this, because businesses are going to be hurt, and some people might even go out of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4060.369s">It's</a> absolutely unfair that this project is going to start in the summer of 2015 and not be completed until November of 2018.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4108.668s">With</a> all due respect to my council colleague, that may be your interpretation, but nothing was ever definitively signed or put in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4115.489s">This</a> council asked to have that put in the RFP that went out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4118.81s">And</a> there are four people, there are four components to the people who are bidding on that bridge, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4122.851s">This</a> council asked that they come here and they apprise the city, the council and the business community and the office of community development as it relates to the progress of that bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4132.333s">And</a> they never did it. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4133.514s">The</a> only meeting that they ever had was, I believe, some three weeks ago at 10 o'clock on a Wednesday morning, for which certain councils couldn't go. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4140.842s">A</a> lot of people couldn't go. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4142.063s">And</a> it was just their staff meeting, if you want to come and see what it's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4146.228s">And</a> then they send you a press release, for which is put in the paper, that basically tells you that this is not going to be completed until 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4154.274s">So</a> if you forget all the gibberish he gets around to 2018, and then they acknowledge that the footings of the bridge, which have been there for 100 plus years, all they're going to do is reshore them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4163.94s">That</a> bridge is not sunk at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4166.082s">And</a> what they think they're building, the Taj Mahal, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4169.284s">They</a> don't need to build the Longfellow Bridge like they're building in Washington. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4173.046s">This</a> is a very simple bridge of 121 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4176.909s">Sure,</a> you want to make it adaptable for people, sidewalks and bikes, go right ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4181.156s">But</a> with the art of technology that's out there today, and for them to tell you it's going to take you a well over a year just to figure out what's underneath the bridge and move the lines and this and that, that is absolutely absurd. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4191.946s">Absolutely</a> absurd. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4192.987s">It's</a> probably the biggest snow job that this council and this city has gotten from the State Department of Public Transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4199.953s">And</a> we haven't even gotten to the issue of the bus routes and the changing of the bus routes and what's going to happen after that and once this bridge goes into construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4208.099s">Mr.</a> President, I'm asking once again, I'm asking you to call the Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4211.722s">Department</a> of Transportation, have them come before this council, and have them explain if what Councilor Camuso was saying is correct, that they are not going to give us mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4220.248s">Point</a> of information?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4250.067s">Well,</a> I'm going to respectfully disagree with my colleague because state agencies and state departments do pay mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4255.171s">And</a> if they're asked to do it, they do do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4257.253s">The</a> biggest one out there right now is the MWRA. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4259.574s">They</a> will give you mitigation before they even start a project because they have to realize the length and the strength of their pipes.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4301.863s">Well,</a> I'm responsible for what I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4303.304s">And</a> what I know is this, that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts does and can, if the city of Medford is going to be impacted to such a degree and businesses are going to be displaced for a period of time such as that, <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4313.395s">When</a> you have your own Chamber of Commerce, and when you have an entire city council, and when you've been talking about this since 2013, and went out since 2015, and there is nothing, no acknowledgement, no public hearing, no public meeting, it's a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4327.186s">And</a> if you think they're doing a good job, <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4328.897s">taking</a> this bridge over and cutting down the amount of time that it's going to take. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4333.658s">It's</a> wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4334.758s">It's</a> not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4335.619s">This</a> is not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4336.819s">This</a> does not speak well for a governmental project and a governmental agency. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4341.0s">And</a> more importantly, how can you go and start with $2 million, go as high as $12 million, bring it back to $10 million? <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4348.682s">They</a> can't even figure out what the actual cost is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4351.422s">And</a> the total disruption is going to be when they put that ramp in Medford Square, <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4355.309s">and</a> shutting off one of the ramps coming off Route 93, there's going to be a complete fiasco. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4360.672s">We</a> still haven't seen the final product. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4363.034s">It</a> still hasn't been presented to the business people, the Chamber of Commerce, or this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4369.118s">And</a> that, to me, is what this whole system, this whole project is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4373.72s">Absolutely</a> no transparency at all.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4409.485s">Point</a> of clarification, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4411.345s">The</a> meeting took place on the 18th of July, 2013, and it took place at the Century Bank and Trust on Mystic Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4419.147s">The</a> time that came over here, his name was Billy something, he appeared here from Medford and his other person. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4425.629s">That's</a> what took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4426.869s">And</a> that meeting, we were told, as a matter of fact, <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4429.785s">I</a> have Mr. Davies' private personal number because at that particular night, in that particular meeting, they were trying to shut me off. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4436.532s">I'm</a> asking him a very important question as to why this meeting was not being held here in Medford and where is the mitigation as it relates to the concern that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4444.761s">If</a> you're not going to give us mitigation, what are you going to give to the business community? <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4448.445s">Don't</a> tell me you're going to pay for the disruption or the destruction to their product. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4451.882s">Of</a> course they would have to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4453.043s">That's</a> common sense tells you that. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4454.723s">But</a> don't come in here and do a project and totally disrupt the entire community of the downtown area. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4459.325s">You</a> have bus routes, you can have people completely confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4462.366s">Can</a> anyone on this council turn around and explain what's going to go on? <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4465.688s">Can</a> you tell me where the bus routes are going to go?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4479.747s">Point</a> of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4480.327s">Point</a> of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4481.588s">He</a> wants to make representative to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4483.209s">My</a> point is they belong before the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4485.671s">I</a> don't want to do something in the public belongs to hear what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4488.973s">And</a> that's what the council call for. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4490.414s">If</a> he wants to go on his own, good luck to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4492.276s">I</a> want him to come before here. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4493.737s">This</a> is a city of Medford project.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4538.402s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4540.702s">It's</a> got absolutely nothing to do with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4542.303s">He's</a> talking about apples and oranges. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4543.763s">It's</a> got nothing to do with this particular issue.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4547.704s">It's</a> your fictitious mic. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4548.324s">You're</a> going to call him out of order or not? <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4549.504s">This</a> has nothing to do with this issue.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4589.299s">It's</a> right here, Councilor, and it's right here.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4714.532s">Councilor</a> Camuso just referred to the Rose Kennedy Garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4716.793s">The</a> Rose Kennedy Garden was an afterthought. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4718.834s">It</a> was going to be a greenway. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4720.534s">The</a> Rose Kennedy Garden came in after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4722.615s">That</a> was part of the mitigation and the rehabilitation because of the damage and the construction that took place in the artery.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4938.978s">First</a> of all, as it relates to the bus stop, whether it's being moved over the bridge or, as some of us were led to believe, it might be moved to Medford Square, we were supposed to be getting a report back from the T that would indicate where that bus stop was going to be moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4956.165s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4956.845s">The</a> other gentleman who came here that night, his name was Paul King, and he was the project manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4962.187s">He</a> also indicated, for which they have now changed their times from the days and the night shifts as to when <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4968.921s">working</a> hours are going to take place, which is a change from what was written on January 21st, 2015, as compared to the most recent one on May 20th of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4981.45s">And</a> again, once again, none of the businesses are aware of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4984.653s">So</a> there is a, and the request by the council was to have them here. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4988.916s">You</a> know, I'm not going to get hung up on the legality of a hearing or a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4993.299s">It's</a> a request. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4995.06s">And</a> if the request to have a state agency or somebody come here, <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4998.682s">to</a> explain what their project is about, then they should honor the request, either in writing or what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5005.068s">You</a> said, Councilor Dello Russo, when I gave you the letter that you said you couldn't find and you never got, you went to the city clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5011.273s">The</a> city clerk supposedly called them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5014.416s">Never</a> got a response, did you, Mr. Clerk? <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5016.738s">So</a> that's a great way to have, and he called not once, but he called twice. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5020.281s">It's</a> a great way for a state agency to act on behalf of a community that has a major project going through it, <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5026.725s">And</a> we're worried about allegedly a legality from a hearing to a request to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5032.313s">That's</a> absolutely nonsense. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5034.576s">Councilor</a> Knight.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5476.99s">Again,</a> there are subcontractors, as Councilor Marks has alluded to, that are going to be responsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5483.034s">The</a> main contractor here, the signer of the contract is the Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5486.177s">Department</a> of Transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5487.398s">That's</a> the main contractor for the bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5489.502s">But</a> you've got Spectra Energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5490.982s">You've</a> got National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5492.163s">You</a> also even have the city of Medford involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5493.703s">You</a> have the Massachusetts State Police. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5495.283s">You</a> have the State Department of Conservation and Recreation. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5498.424s">And</a> there are other little subcontractors involved in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5501.485s">So</a> I am not going to turn around and say mitigation is not a possibility, when, in fact, it could be a possibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5508.046s">And</a> as far as the meeting goes today, it's another clear-cut example of this council being shut out on any types of meetings such as that, especially when they had a personal interest in this, especially on behalf of the <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5519.347s">of</a> the Metro business folks, and we've been discussing this for months upon months upon months, and not to be even notified about a meeting to go to, it's just wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5529.51s">And</a> that's where the whole sense of frustration comes about, a complete lack of transparency, and that's how mixed messages get sent around, not only to this building, but to the businesses within this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5540.473s">Hopefully,</a> pretty soon, there'll be a major change in this community, and this will not go on, this will not be tolerated. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5555.72s">Mr.</a> President, can we take? <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5556.941s">Yeah,</a> okay, go ahead.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6415.134s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6416.054s">Councilor</a> Penta? <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6416.834s">Just</a> on that point, I'm glad you just brought that up because I was alluding to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6420.226s">When</a> we built our new school buildings, they're going on 13 years now, if not more, the 5% on an annual basis was supposed to be each school budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6429.353s">The</a> state never came in here to monitor that, to see if it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6433.316s">Now,</a> Councilor Caraviello, in the second year of his term, in year two, brought up a report that had $1,200,000 of repairs for the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6440.101s">Isn't</a> that correct, sir? <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6441.041s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6441.562s">$1,200,000</a> for schools that were no more, at that point in time, maybe 12 years old, 10, 11, 12 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6450.88s">And</a> we're worried about a new police station and making sure that it's going to be rehab. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6455.543s">Look</a> up at the ceiling there. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6456.504s">You</a> see that ceiling right there? <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6457.805s">I</a> do. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6458.085s">That's</a> been like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6458.925s">You</a> know how long that's been going on almost three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6462.427s">And</a> the superintendent of schools is sitting exactly where the gentleman is sitting there when that ceiling came down and he's lucky he didn't get killed. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6468.632s">This</a> is what the city's idea of maintenance is right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6471.974s">Cover</a> the hole up, patch it up, and maybe nothing will be said. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6475.136s">You</a> heard it tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6475.856s">You</a> heard about the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6476.817s">You</a> heard about the bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6478.378s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6478.92s">You</a> go through the infrastructure of our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6481.521s">There</a> were just so many things that, for the past many years, have been ignored, completely and totally ignored, whitewashed over. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6489.322s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6490.242s">Because</a> you know why? <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6491.282s">Because</a> in all these bonds that the city has outstanding there, they're all going to be paid on a back end. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6497.364s">So</a> it's interest only for the first five or six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6500.864s">God</a> bless whoever the next mayor is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6503.225s">And</a> I hope I have a chance to do this, because I want to revitalize that whole situation on how <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6509.298s">this</a> city is going to pay for those bonds in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6512.44s">Do</a> you realize on the fifth and the sixth year what the cost is going to be in this particular budget to pay for those bonds? <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6517.904s">You</a> won't see any new buildings in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6519.464s">You'll</a> just be paying off for the bonds that you have here right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6524.067s">So</a> what needs to take place here is a thorough and an exhaustive review of how these buildings are going to be reviewed, how these buildings are going to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6533.713s">This</a> past year, the school department budget passed $2 million additional dollars, from last year to this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6540.374s">God</a> knows what they have in it for this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6542.575s">Salaries</a> increased, as the councilor to my right, Councilor Lungo-Koehn and current. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6546.095s">Some</a> people got $20,000 salary increases, and I believe there was almost $32 million in transfers from last year's budget before the end of the year took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6556.757s">So</a> how are we talking about that being a legitimate budget when you pass it in the beginning of the year? <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6561.078s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6562.03s">These</a> are all tricks of the trade, apparently, that have been going on for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6565.711s">But</a> if you have, all of a sudden, $2 million in additional dollars, and you start hiring extra people at $90,000 and $100,000 a year, and you take it away from the classroom, you take it away from the teachers, you take it away from the supplies, and you take it away from the front entrance of that high school, it looks like it's bombed out, like a war zone, because the bricks and everything are shattered. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6584.754s">I'm</a> surprised there are enough kids that have not broken their ankles or their legs. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6588.294s">Handles</a> are still off the front door to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6590.935s">That's</a> wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6592.118s">And</a> when a parent goes up there and looks at it and says, is that where I'm going to send my kid? <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6596.041s">Do</a> I really want my kid to go there? <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6598.282s">That's</a> why they get forced to go to these private schools, because appearance, as you know, is the name of the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6605.907s">They</a> spent $500,000 to redo this building over, just this council chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6610.41s">I</a> think it cost $497,000 to build the entire building, PWA days. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6612.111s">But</a> $500,000 to do this over. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6617.957s">That's</a> been like that for three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6619.278s">And</a> then the molding, if you look at the molding, that's ready to go and that's coming down and nothing's been done, nothing in the budget, no repair work, no nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6626.261s">And</a> y'all worried about a police station and they can't even figure out how to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6632.084s">The</a> next administration hopefully will be a work in composite between the council and the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6638.107s">And</a> there's going to be a meeting of the minds. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6640.195s">And</a> so that way there, when the money is going to be spent, it's going to be spent, and everybody's going to be on board to understand how it's going to be spent, when it's going to be spent, and where it's going to be spent for. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6649.122s">That</a> hasn't taken place here in 28 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6651.664s">But</a> I can assure you, it will take place.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6670.137s">we</a> laid on the table last week to this week.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6688.108s">Mr.</a> President, as a result of unfortunately the merger that did not take place between partners and Lawrence Memorial hospital and the Melrose Wakefield on January 29th of this past year, <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6699.317s">when</a> Judge Sanders issued her 48-page decision not agreeing to this because she did not believe that what Martha Coakley had put together was going to work in the best interests of the hospitals mentioned in as well as offshore. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6713.983s">And</a> then on top of that, Mara Healy, the new attorney general coming in and likewise not only supporting the judge but nixing the whole deal and is willing to go to court <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6728.387s">I</a> believe we have a council resolution asking her and both parties to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6732.949s">I've</a> taken the time to speak to some doctors and some employees up at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6740.112s">And</a> since at the present time, the third and the fourth floor of the hospital is not being used to any type of its potential, nevermind its maximum, I'd like to make an offering and throw this back out. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6751.857s">And</a> hopefully it gets back to not only the Lawrence Memorial, but to partners because <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6756.163s">If</a> we take a look at the doctors that are operating here in the city of Medford that are Hallmark Hospital doctors and at the same time private practitioners, and offer them room and space on the third and fourth floor of the hospital, and leaving the first and second floors available for emergency, for prompt care, emergency services, and what's presently in there right now, it would be a way not only to utilize the hospital <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6781.188s">with</a> a complete medical density of doctors, no matter what their professions might be, and at the same time, make the offering to partners, rather than have the Lawrence be part of a consortium, which included the South Shore, which included Melrose-Wakefield. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6797.316s">It</a> could be an independent, isolated medical facility that the partners, Mass General, would be willing to entertain, which would not have to go through any type of a consortium, or review, or to go through <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6811.719s">48-page</a> review. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6813.86s">People</a> don't realize that the Lawrence Memorial Hospital was in a profit-making position before this whole idea of this merger took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6822.262s">And</a> for the last few years, a lot of its finances and a lot of its profits have been carried over to the Melrose-Wakefield. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6829.364s">And</a> unfortunately for the Lawrence Memorial, they did not receive the same benefits that the Melrose-Wakefield Hospital has received most recently over the past two to three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6839.755s">And</a> that's maybe because the former president, who's no longer the president, who left the day after the deal didn't go through, did not have the same feeling to the Lawrence Memorial as he had as being president over at the Melrose-Wakefield. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6853.698s">But</a> I think this would really bode well for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6856.319s">I</a> think it would bode well for our citizens, seniors, mothers with babies, emergency room, prompt care locations, and for any other doctor that might be having a situation where <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6867.412s">either</a> parking presents itself with a problem, location presents itself with a problem, but if they were all centrally located, because everybody knows where the Lawrence Memorial Hospital is, and if they were centrally located there, and they worked their offices out of that building, and even if they looked at the positioning that the doctors, to some degree, are not part of the nonprofit, and there is a way to legally separate the buildings or the floors or what have you, because anything is possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6893.132s">So</a> that's why I'm throwing this out there as a possibility <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6896.192s">to</a> keep as many doctors as we can here, but also the greater possibility to bring Mass General partners here into the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6903.536s">They</a> have a great interest in Mr. Cardiology. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6906.178s">They</a> think it's a great team of doctors that are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6908.979s">They</a> were one of the first, if not the first group of doctors that partners, I believe, entertain for the purposes of hopefully being part of this consortium. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6916.824s">But</a> again, unfortunately on January 29th when the deal did not go through and Judge Sanders didn't approve it because she felt that for which Martha Coakley <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6924.876s">had</a> put in her request for the merger that the cost would not be contained, as they said it would be for a six-year period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6933.942s">And</a> as a result of that, I believe there were 50 independent doctors and medical professionals and presidents of other hospitals, local area hospitals, who did not want it, did not believe it would serve in the best interest of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6946.39s">And</a> I believe that's the reason why. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6947.591s">That's</a> what the 48-page decision says. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6951.39s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I move, Mr. Clerk, and I don't know if the words are going to be very probably general right now, that the Lawrence Memorial Hospital look at entertaining the utilization of their third and fourth floor locations for the purposes of offering to all Medford doctors an opportunity <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=6978.302s">to</a> house their private practices there in concert with the first and second, with the emergency and prompt care, the other medical facilities that the Lawrence Memorial offers now, and present that to the Partners Mass General Board, our president,
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7008.97s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7009.97s">For</a> the purposes of presenting to the hallmark help in essence, and they present that to partners mass general for the purposes of being an independent affiliate of the mass general and not part of the original consortium. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7030.025s">You</a> have it, Eddie? <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7030.965s">You</a> may have to go back and watch the video. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7032.066s">Oh,</a> there you are.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7045.19s">Not</a> with Hallmark Health, but speaking with their doctors, nurses, and as well as patients who thought it was a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7050.572s">But</a> doctors and nurses, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7053.333s">So</a> that's a negative.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7075.673s">We'll</a> call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7076.253s">Mr.</a> President and have that forwarded to the Hallmark board of directors to be forwarded to home, uh, to be forwarded to, uh, partners, mass general.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7136.284s">On</a> the motion, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7138.484s">I</a> am absolutely perplexed. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7140.385s">You</a> and Councilor Knight are both offering these resolutions, but when this was presented over here for the purposes of possibly entertaining it by Mr. Storella, <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7149.297s">that</a> both of you were opposed to it, and now all of a sudden you're for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7153.16s">And</a> the people who had an opportunity to speak on it aren't even here? <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7155.842s">I</a> respectfully request that I lay on the table, and anyone interested who might be watching can come next week to discuss this. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7161.547s">Because</a> I think this is way too important of an issue to not have the public either be advised of it, but I'm just dumbfounded that people who are against it now want to get an opinion, when you didn't want to do it back then.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7177.732s">But</a> you refused the gentleman when he came before, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7180.882s">So</a> what changed your mind?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7377.356s">Is</a> the Council's sense saying that there is a — when the — at present administration, there was a security sense here, but now there is a sense of insecurity?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7407.297s">I</a> really think the people of this community are smart enough to understand and to realize that when this issue has been brought up, as it has been brought up, and I really am going to respectfully ask my colleagues to lay it on the table so that way the people who are watching it can come next week and discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7422.267s">And</a> I think, Councilor De La Russa, you owe it to the public to come down from the chair and explain why you're putting this resolution on when you were wholeheartedly against it before. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7429.402s">Because</a> this doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7431.607s">You</a> have to stand behind that for what you're proffering. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7434.214s">You</a> just can't turn around and put a resolution on and not tell the people why. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7437.855s">This</a> is such a huge, huge issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7440.556s">You're</a> talking about the community's charter that you were diabolically opposed to before. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7445.878s">Now</a> all of a sudden, out of the clear blue sky, and I don't know who put this bug in your ear, to have this resolution come before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7454.619s">If</a> you're that much for it, well, then why don't you just have the city solicitor come forward and just tell him, Mr. Solicitor, there seems to be a feeling in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7463.802s">Could</a> you just come here and explain it? <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7466.403s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7467.063s">I</a> don't think you thought this up on your own, because that would be just too good to be true. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7471.184s">The</a> fact of the matter is, you sat there and you were against it, same as he was, and same as Councilor Camuso.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7480.347s">God.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7482.693s">They</a> moved that the paper lay on the table and allow the people to come next week who have an interest on this particular subject matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7489.395s">You</a> had an 80-year-old gentleman who was walking the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7493.236s">You</a> basically embarrassed him and insulted him at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7500.698s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7500.938s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7501.138s">He</a> said things were all right the way they were.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7517.408s">Why</a> the change?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7529.538s">Why</a> are you afraid to let people come and talk on it?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7538.002s">Are</a> you withdrawing your motion today? <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7539.183s">No,</a> there's people who want to talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7540.423s">I</a> don't want to talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7540.903s">You.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7550.988s">I'm</a> not... No, I'm not withdrawing it because I... The motion is tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7554.25s">If</a> I find... Okay, if it's undervalued. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=7555.49s">The</a> motion is tabled.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8150.07s">Point</a> of clarification to those meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8155.272s">Tony,</a> when we were at those meetings, one of the things that were brought up that was pretty much not clear, because a lot of people didn't go back to 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8164.414s">When</a> this whole change of government took place way back when, it wasn't just a one option issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8170.416s">It</a> was a double option. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8171.536s">You</a> could retain the council manager form of government, or you could go forward with the strong AMEA. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8178.401s">A</a> lot of people seem to think that that wasn't the way it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8180.983s">We</a> had 32 meetings, 32 meetings, open to the public, open and notorious. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8186.867s">And</a> then we had, I believe there was a Charter Review Committee, and then there became a Charter Commission, was elected citywide throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8194.734s">And</a> then, I believe it's some year after that, it's a four to five year process. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8199.738s">This</a> isn't an overnight thing, and people think it's gonna change overnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8203.421s">This</a> is open and notorious. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8204.882s">There</a> were many, many meetings, <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8206.606s">And</a> if you digest each and every part of the segments of the charter, that's what this thing was all about, and that's where it was going. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8212.928s">The</a> unfortunate part, even though the vote was four to three, the unfortunate part about many good things were starting to come about. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8219.529s">And</a> I think all we were looking for, all that I guess you guys were looking for at the time, and I was willing to support, was having each council become involved, what a citizen, what a committee, in going over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8232.272s">And</a> then when the time came to make a presentation, you make a presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8235.906s">That's</a> all that it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8236.906s">This</a> wasn't trying to upstage anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8239.347s">And</a> you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8240.147s">This</a> wasn't out there to smash anybody or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8243.068s">It</a> was run very logically and very, very courteously. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8246.87s">People</a> expressed their opinions as what they wanted to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8250.251s">And</a> again, I just, you know, I still think there are other people out there who would like to come and speak on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8256.713s">And</a> just all due respect to my colleagues, I just ask that it lay on the table until next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8261.034s">And</a> at least that way, there are people, if they want to come, they come. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8264.386s">At</a> least they had an opportunity to know it's there.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8291.632s">And</a> just like the US Constitution when it was passed, <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8294.423s">It</a> was very marginal on each one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8296.884s">Many</a> of them were 5 to 4, 6 to 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8299.105s">There</a> weren't many that were really overwhelming. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8301.467s">And</a> you're going to probably find this on this particular issue, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8303.968s">But</a> you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8305.209s">This</a> charter to be looked at today is going to be for the benefit of the citizens of tomorrow, for the people who are 20, 30, and 40 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8312.112s">I</a> mean, we're at an age right now, you know, we're living within something that's already there. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8316.054s">It's</a> been established. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8317.84s">But</a> whoever the new council is going to be, your job isn't for today. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8322.163s">Your</a> job is where this city is going to be going for tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8325.086s">It's</a> direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8326.327s">And</a> how are we going to enhance the vitality and rejuvenate this city to a point that's saying, hey, our government is working with us and it's moving forward with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8334.153s">And</a> Jeannie, whether it's a brand new police station or not, how we're going to get there, that's what you need to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8339.657s">How</a> it's going to be financed, that's what you need to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8342.299s">You</a> just can't say you want something. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8344.081s">This</a> is how we're going to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8345.002s">And</a> it's going to be collective. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8347.05s">And</a> it'll be a cleft of thought process to get to that point, something that's been sort of like missing for a long period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8353.252s">And</a> hopefully the new council, whoever those Councilors might be, will realize that you do have an important role to play in this city and you're not going to be ostracized and you should be a game player for the future, just like the mayor is going to be a game player for the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8367.415s">You</a> know, we're elected to do the people's business. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8369.315s">We're</a> not elected here to be for ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8372.516s">There's</a> no personal gain in here for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8374.477s">I'll</a> speak for myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8375.994s">I</a> love this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8376.695s">I've</a> spent a lot of time in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8378.536s">I've</a> been elected for a lot of years, and I'm very thankful to the taxpayers for that, and the rate payers, and the citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8384.541s">But</a> you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8385.442s">This</a> is a new day dawned. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8386.843s">We're</a> moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8387.744s">We're</a> going into a new direction, and that's hopefully — I hope the taxpayers buy into that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8393.91s">Yes,</a> it's a collaboration.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8694.303s">Mr.</a> President, um, I'm going to apologize to you because, um, I think we've seen it and heard enough here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8702.526s">I</a> understand when you come out, you know what I'm going to ask you to do if you don't mind, would you just withdraw your motion and put it legitimately on the agenda for next week? <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8709.708s">And</a> then that way there it's open and notorious and then everybody can discuss it because I think it can accomplish the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8715.951s">And</a> at the same time, it's just such an important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8720.14s">to</a> have it come under suspension of the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8721.801s">I</a> just think, can I, can I explain why I did what I did?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8764.229s">And</a> I can appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8765.149s">But</a> at the same time, it's such, it's, it's, it's the thing that makes this city run. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8769.33s">It's,</a> it's charter and you know, and if it was on the agenda, there'd be no, I'd have no problem with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8773.912s">I'm</a> just, you know, it just reflects me back to the four to three vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8778.153s">You</a> have to understand, <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8779.512s">You're</a> on one position, and I'm on another. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8781.392s">But</a> I think we're on the same page as far as getting an opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8784.373s">So</a> that's what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8785.873s">If</a> you don't mind withdrawing it and just putting it on the agenda for next week, I would be more than happy with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8790.134s">That</a> would be OK.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8799.415s">Well,</a> because there are other people who were actively involved that might want to come and speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8803.376s">And</a> I want them to have an opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8805.297s">Under</a> suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8807.417s">Under</a> suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8809.094s">It's</a> not on the agenda, you know?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8818.819s">But</a> at the same time, but at the same time, Freddy, if I, if I laid it on the table and it wins, it sits there for another week. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8824.081s">But</a> if it's on the agenda next week, it doesn't make any difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8827.483s">At</a> least it's open. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8828.423s">People</a> can see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8829.224s">I'll</a> withdraw it and place it on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8831.765s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8832.926s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8833.506s">I</a> appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8834.526s">Motion</a> is withdrawn.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8922.292s">Wait</a> a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8926.658s">Oh,</a> they remain on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8928.039s">One</a> last thing, in all seriousness. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8930.341s">I</a> want my council colleagues to call me, because I am really impassioned about this issue regarding achata. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8938.388s">So</a> I want to apologize to you, because I just was looking at you as being probably a naysayer back then. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8946.335s">And</a> I can understand where you're coming from now. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8948.677s">Same</a> thing with Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8949.858s">He</a> was dead set against it, but that's beside the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8952.258s">The</a> fact of the matter is, you're the one that's standing up there, so I apologize, but I thank you for withdrawing, and I thank you for putting it on the agenda next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8959.803s">To</a> me, it's probably the most important thing that makes this city run, it's charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8964.826s">Thank</a> you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8965.787s">You're</a> welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=8966.387s">Councilor</a> Knight?<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_-Ufepi4QYj4/2025-03-21_-Ufepi4QYj4.html">Medford City Council - May 19, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=156.48s">On</a> that motion, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=158.061s">Judge,</a> what's at 11 Hall Street right now?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=170.494s">So</a> this is nothing more than a change in name? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=172.315s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=173.296s">Change</a> in name to the same location, right Mr. Park?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=178.218s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=179.678s">Very</a> good.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=2071.133s">Could</a> you explain what a kilovolt is as compared to what's there now?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=2142.898s">So</a> by having this upgrade, you're improving what?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=2199.842s">What's</a> the cost of the project?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=2253.87s">So</a> if it's $75 million and whatever the cost is going to be in the future, <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=2258.524s">What</a> portion of that $75 million is coming into the city of Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=2261.406s">Do</a> you have that broken down yet?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=2294.189s">If</a> I understand this correctly, National Grid is part of Eversource, correct?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=2334.616s">So</a> during this past winter, the electric rates went up approximately 39%. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=2339.675s">because</a> supposedly they can't find the energy, or the energy costs more, or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=2344.46s">What's</a> this going to cost the city of Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=2346.062s">Because</a> somebody's going to have to pay for this.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=2430.22s">But</a> method will bear a cost, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=2431.88s">Method</a> rate payers will bear a cost.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=2445.563s">But</a> it's going to go up now.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=2452.304s">He</a> just said the cost is going to go up.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=2458.617s">Well,</a> I don't want anyone to think that this is going to be, you know, we're getting a freebie here because we're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=2464.061s">So</a> is there any way that maybe you can figure out approximately what the cost can be once you get going?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=2509.832s">The</a> issue that I have with that, Mr. President, is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=2514.25s">You</a> just said $6 to $9 million per mile, and we had approximately 3.2 miles, you said, in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=2521.653s">But</a> I think is that going to be fair enough to say that the entire community pays the cost, or is it just the location that it's going to serve? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=2530.315s">I</a> mean, is this going to serve the entire city?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=2566.972s">But</a> somewhere along the line, you're going to have some kind of an estimate of what this is going to be.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=2578.777s">And</a> the last question, Mr. President, is you have this section from here to here that you're going to be resolving because you're trying to make it regionalized and all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=2588.221s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=2589.482s">What</a> about the points getting to it from both ends? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=2591.763s">Are</a> they all regionalized or are they going to have to be done?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3642.122s">Yes,</a> I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3644.203s">During</a> today, I don't know if you've read in today's globe in the city and the town of Plymouth, huge epidemic down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3649.268s">They've</a> had over 101 people I think have passed on. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3652.67s">I</a> think the governor was down there and I believe there's something that's going down there with the sheriff of that particular County and it's, it's, it's vastly spreading throughout the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3661.978s">You</a> just made an indication that who is the personnel director? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3667.535s">Yeah,</a> it was Mila. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3668.396s">No,</a> she said she wasn't.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3672.703s">Yeah,</a> because when I spoke to her, she said she wasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3676.188s">So</a> we don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3676.849s">Can</a> we get Mr. Quirk on this as a side note? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3679.934s">Can</a> we find out who the personnel director is? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3683.486s">Who</a> is the new personnel director? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3685.807s">At</a> this point, it would be Louise Miller. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3687.448s">No,</a> in my conversation with her, she did not get that title.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3694.092s">So</a> can we just find out officially if she is?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3724.985s">If</a> we can get the information that also comes back and if it is a CAF 12, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3730.512s">as</a> we usually normally get in our budget, it puts the dollar amount next to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3734.193s">So</a> I agree with council Lungo. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3735.974s">And</a> I think we have never passed having an audience without knowing what the description is for. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3740.795s">So</a> I just think it makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3742.756s">And</a> no, no, on this one here, we have its first reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3747.057s">And</a> when it comes back to the next reading, they can put the salary, what the salary is going to be in the description, salary description.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3781.387s">And</a> also on the D paper, who was this personnel director? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3784.508s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3789.259s">approval</a> for the first reading.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4033.691s">I</a> passed the chief of question. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4040.257s">Are</a> you aware of this position?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4048.964s">Is</a> this particular individual, whoever he or she might be going to have access to <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4054.765s">police</a> files and vice versa, because apparently this is going to be part of it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4204.759s">On</a> this particular paper, you know what it shows? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4208.06s">It</a> shows something that seems to be pretty consistent here for the next three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4213.742s">There's</a> a 2% raise, 2% and 2%. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4216.663s">And</a> from my understanding, as it relates to contracts that are forthcoming, I believe there's a whole host of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4223.385s">I</a> think it bodes well for the community to know that <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4226.364s">If</a> employees all working for the same government, they all work for the city of Medford, they all work for the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4232.067s">And</a> I think we had this conversation many years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4234.248s">It</a> would be nice if we could all step in line to the same amount on the percentages. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4238.791s">The</a> other entitlements, the other benefits is a different story. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4241.612s">But</a> at least it puts the house in a much better financial order to know that every employee is going to wind up getting the same amount of money by percentage because that's all the city can afford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4249.997s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4251.95s">Number</a> two, I believe there was a lady here a few weeks ago and she was talking about the Method Public Library and the possibility, because they haven't reached a certain dollar amount, that a waiver could be attainable. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4264.794s">I</a> believe that they just received their waiver from the Commonwealth of Mass, and they are one of 75 libraries that did receive that, and we're also in the Minuteman category. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4277.038s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, not only do I move approval, <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4282.099s">but</a> I think it's a good step forward, and I think it's a step that we really need to sit down, and knowing the fact that we had to get a waiver to get into that category, I think we need to talk about that, and maybe, Mr. Clerk, put that as part of the resolution of approval when the budget time comes, as it relates to the waiver that the Medford Public Library has now gotten, because they've been trying to get this for a few years, and they now got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4308.647s">What</a> is the situation that dictates the waiver <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4312.419s">and</a> what needs to be done so we can maybe go on the road, so to speak, without having to apply for a waiver. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4319.545s">I</a> mean, what's the necessary ingredients to stay out of the waiver category? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4322.667s">So</a> this is the waiver for the accreditation, you're saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4324.789s">No,</a> the waiver to, there is a dollar amount that's a criteria that they have to be in. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4332.035s">And</a> I don't know if the proper word is certification or qualification. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4335.578s">But</a> that we did, wasn't that last week's resolution? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4337.98s">That</a> was a few weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4339.081s">Point</a> of information, we did ask for that last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4341.246s">But</a> they got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4342.026s">They</a> got certified with the waiver.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4347.409s">No,</a> no, I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4348.269s">But</a> that's what I want to find out. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4349.57s">When</a> they come in here to do the budget, let them come in to explain this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4352.631s">So</a> a lot of people ask the question, why does the library need a waiver? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4355.873s">What</a> do they need the waiver for? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4357.233s">What's</a> the dollar amount involved? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4358.514s">And</a> how do we stay away from going into the waiver if something needs to be done? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4362.756s">Is</a> it because of the building that's in desperate need of help? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4365.448s">between</a> the roof leaking and the bathrooms that are desplicable and the books and some of the books, I don't know, but I think we need to discuss this.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4486.944s">I</a> hear what Councilor Camuso was alluding to. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4488.726s">But</a> you just mentioned somebody, a group, that hasn't received a raise in, I think, eight years, if not more. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4495.15s">That's</a> the lunch mothers. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4496.37s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4496.851s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4497.191s">They</a> haven't received anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4498.692s">They're</a> like the forgotten school and the whole school department budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4503.052s">And</a> when you talk about percentages, whether it's 1%, 2%, or 3%, my idea was just looking at it from the point of view, what would the dollar cost be? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4510.313s">A</a> lot of these contracts go from zero to six months, and six months to 12 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4515.714s">So</a> it's a barometer. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4516.914s">It's</a> a starting point. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4518.115s">For</a> those that don't remember, many years ago, I think John Golony, when he was the city manager, had indicated that that would probably be a pretty good way to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4524.716s">So</a> you'd have an idea where your money would be going on an annual basis rather than every six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4529.797s">But</a> if we're going to get into that, I would hope, <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4533.05s">The</a> city administration this year recognizes loudly the lunch mothers in the method of public school system who have dedicated themselves for year in and year out for the measly, um, dollars that they make per hour for which they love it because they're around the kids, but they've been the forgotten souls. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4548.659s">And</a> it becomes very tough as council along alluded to, and we've just got a $2 million increase this past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4554.85s">to</a> hire seven new individuals making an excessive $90,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4558.892s">That's</a> not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4559.713s">So</a> you need to take care of the people that are there that have paid their dues year in and year out, instead of hiring people at $90,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4565.956s">We</a> don't even know if we can sustain them this year in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4569.362s">The</a> politics will certainly go around this budget.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=5067.479s">Chief,</a> you said this came out in 1995. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=5069.96s">That's</a> almost 20 years ago.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=5086.825s">Now,</a> this title of student officer, since we didn't have this before, what were these trainees called?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=5105.237s">So</a> you're going to be going from the $56,000 or $57,000 range down to $40,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=5106.758s">That's</a> the recommended figure.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=5136.578s">Then</a> let me ask you the next question. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=5137.959s">I</a> don't know if you can answer this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=5140.278s">You're</a> calling it student officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=5142.059s">Is</a> this going to have the same implication for the fire department?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=5202.679s">So</a> in essence, they're only trainees, correct?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=5210.561s">But</a> an officer doesn't give the same implication as a trainee.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=5224.003s">So</a> what's the period of time from the time somebody, you bring them on and they graduate the academy? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=5228.984s">What's</a> the time period?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=5231.725s">So</a> that's what these people are, student officers? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=5233.825s">Student</a> officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=5234.845s">So</a> why don't they call them student trainees, student police trainees?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=5245.668s">Yeah,</a> but couldn't a student officer mean anything
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=5252.598s">That's</a> the general law statute?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=5259.039s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6263.015s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6264.036s">Um,</a> chief, I'm, I'm glad that you're here because the first thing I want to talk about is something that I believe it came up at your March meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6272.179s">Um,</a> we'll start with this group of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6274.1s">You</a> have folks that have purchased permit stickers to park in the governor's app parking lot who are business merchants. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6282.724s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6283.504s">And</a> these merchants, um, two in particular on, <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6289.443s">any</a> particular day have been unable to go into the Governor's Air parking lot to find a spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6296.505s">And</a> by not being able to find a spot, the gentleman who supposedly is in the parking lot over there turned around and told them it's okay for them to park on the street on Governor's Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6308.369s">Now,</a> this one particular person has received four tickets since Saturday in the amount of $100, four $25 tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6313.19s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6316.265s">I</a> believe at the March meeting they come up to you and they asked you about this as it relates to, and I believe that you indicated to them, paraphrasing, that you would be okay to park on Governor's Avenue if there were no spots because you have a permit parking sticker and the cars should be able to pick it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6334.273s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6335.834s">Number</a> two, there's a gentleman who parked his car, put the money in the meter, <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6343.186s">And</a> the expiration of the media was at 144. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6348.411s">He</a> got a ticket, chief, at 104, for which the expiration wasn't even anywhere near it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6357.258s">The</a> gentleman who gave him the ticket turned around and says, if you don't like it, you know what to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6361.362s">Appeal.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6363.804s">The</a> next issue is, is a resident who lives on Governor's Avenue, a resident who lives on Governor's Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6371.328s">And</a> this resident got a ticket after 10 o'clock at night by the bounty hunters that the city has hired to go out there and give tickets to. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6382.558s">Absolutely</a> wrong, chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6385.14s">Question</a> then was asked on this particular individual, parking on the street, resident parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6392.727s">They</a> told her she had to move her car every two hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6396.33s">And</a> by moving her car every two hours brings it up to midnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6400.025s">And</a> this woman is just upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6404.526s">Next</a> one is in Medford Square, behind the UPS store. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6410.587s">Lady</a> goes out there, puts money in the meter, which is good until 10.22. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6415.028s">The</a> gentleman comes up to her at 10.11, starts to give her a ticket, and she says to him, what are you doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6425.11s">He</a> says, well, listen, don't worry about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6427.151s">I</a> can take it back if you get a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6429.513s">He</a> didn't give her the ticket because she said to him, what are you doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6434.677s">Chief,</a> you have a lady in Medford Square who is a registered hairdresser who has in excess of 250 signatures because this is killing her business in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6446.045s">This</a> is not Elsie, but the other end of the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6448.327s">This</a> is on Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6450.348s">This</a> thing with the Republic has not gotten any better. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6453.891s">Two</a> complaints from individuals who have out-of-state plates that come into Medford Square <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6459.832s">They</a> try to put their plate number in, and it doesn't take. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6462.953s">They</a> don't know what to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6463.873s">They</a> go into the store, and they come out, and they get a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6469.894s">This</a> is not making any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6471.855s">These</a> things are supposed to be resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6474.175s">On</a> High Street, you and I had this conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6476.396s">I</a> have the tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6476.996s">I</a> have the pictures in my bag. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6478.696s">They</a> still have the kiosk in front of a two-family residential house for which people still try to put money in the meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6485.522s">thinking</a> that they're supposed to, which McCulloch paid to park there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6490.766s">That</a> was one of the very first ones they said they were going to remove as soon as the weather got better, as soon as the snowstorm ended. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6497.45s">And</a> we could just go on and on with the telephone calls relative to the people saying they try to put money into the machine. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6502.654s">One</a> lady put a quarter in the machine. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6503.794s">She</a> got four quarters back. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6505.736s">But</a> she didn't get her ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6507.257s">She</a> got a ticket that had a different license plate number on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6511.262s">So</a> unfortunately, or good for her, she didn't get a ticket because she didn't get the right receipt that went to her number plate. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6518.364s">This</a> craziness has got to stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6520.744s">I</a> mean, these people that are giving out the tickets, it's a combination of them not knowing what they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6525.005s">You</a> can't tell someone if you don't like it, appeal it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6527.286s">You</a> can't go up to somebody, and I think it even reflects upon Councilor Caraviello, on one particular day near CVS, they were just waiting to put a ticket in his car. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6535.968s">I</a> mean, they're all here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6537.688s">I'm</a> not making this stuff up. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6539.549s">And</a> I think it's just wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6541.02s">But</a> when it's so blatant, giving a guy a ticket, when he has until 144, and they give him a ticket 104, well, if you don't like it, appeal it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6549.407s">I</a> mean, how do you do this? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6551.428s">How</a> do you say it's OK?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6562.257s">Then</a> you have the one on Governor's Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6564.599s">At</a> 10.07 AM, she put a quarter in the meter at 10.07 AM. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6570.487s">She</a> ran into the UPS store, came out at 1011, and the guy was sitting there waiting to give her a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6575.211s">And</a> the ticket expires at 1022. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6580.014s">It's</a> wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6580.895s">This</a> is wrong, chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6581.816s">This</a> is not what the people asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6583.837s">This</a> is not what the city expected from it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6586.46s">They've</a> had more than enough time to get their act together. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6588.821s">I</a> just think it's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6590.643s">Can</a> I address a few of these?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6624.313s">No,</a> that's Governor's Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6624.914s">That's</a> where they park.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6649.855s">It</a> should be a problem, because the fact of the matter is, if the city is giving out too many tickets or too many permits, and there's more permits that are allowed in the parking lot, how do you blame the person that bought the permit, believing that they could use the parking lot, but now have to go up on Governor's Avenue to find a spot?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6679.323s">15,</a> 30, one hour, and then two hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6680.524s">But</a> these people pay the $100 for their parking permit, OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6683.586s">They</a> shouldn't be getting a ticket.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6685.808s">It</a> doesn't have to, but they shouldn't be guaranteed getting a ticket either if they can't find a spot.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6724.559s">Chief,</a> what do you do if somebody's handicapped, they have a business permit parking? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6727.36s">They</a> have to go out and then they come back.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6733.322s">Well,</a> you know as well as I that they've given out tickets to people that have a handicapped placard, OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6737.763s">These</a> people are pretty rude as to what they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6739.984s">And</a> they're only out there to make money. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6741.665s">They</a> don't care about the simple little guy who's just trying to negotiate his day's life, trying to spend $0.25 or $0.50 in a parking lot to do their business. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6749.907s">That's</a> wrong.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6793.829s">How</a> can they test them for accuracy if I put money in a machine and I get somebody else's receipt? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6799.937s">How</a> does that work?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6843.818s">And</a> she got a ticket at 10 p.m.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6850.222s">But</a> what are they doing out at 10 o'clock at night?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6861.964s">Do</a> you know what the contract says about all of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6864.205s">These</a> people are supposed to be trained, they're supposed to know the streets that they give the tickets on, and they were supposed to have a course in this, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6871.687s">And</a> they acknowledged, Mr. Nash, when he acknowledged that they hadn't done it, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6875.248s">And</a> we're still dealing with the same problems from a contract signed on October 10th, 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6879.99s">This</a> makes no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6882.491s">This</a> is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6883.755s">People</a> should not even have to go and have a ticket waived. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6886.576s">They</a> shouldn't even have to go to give you a call. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6888.517s">They</a> shouldn't have to go to a travel. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6889.698s">They</a> shouldn't have to be inconvenienced for this, because these people should know what they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6893.699s">And</a> they're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6894.58s">They're</a> causing a hardship to people.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6971.744s">But</a> the difference between what you're talking about, the patrons that she had before, before these crazy kiosk stuff came in, maybe she got a two- or three-hour person. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6979.456s">And</a> she wasn't losing these one or two customers, whatever they might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6983.677s">This</a> past week, I was in West Medford, and I saw a lady walk out of the hairdresser across the street with the curls in her hair. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6989.938s">She</a> was having a foil, just to run out to go in there and to put the money in the meter, which made no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6996.239s">Because</a> I thought the parking lots were going to be three hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=6999.22s">The</a> signs still have not been changed.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7007.322s">So</a> how do they turn around and give people tickets? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7008.922s">Tell</a> me.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7016.776s">I'm</a> going to just say, if I were the mayor, you know this would be the second thing in this building to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7020.696s">That</a> would be the second contract of the city to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7023.397s">I</a> won't tell you what the first one is, but that's the second one.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7246.868s">President</a> council Pender chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7249.569s">Yes,</a> sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7251.37s">Page</a> and their operator employees standards on page 13 of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7259.415s">It</a> says the operator shall be solely responsible for the complete training of all its parking enforcement personnel and will maintain training records as prescribed by law or policy as appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7270.0s">This</a> training will include, but not be limited to customer service, conflict management, <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7275.445s">civil</a> rights law, disability and accessibility laws and procedures, municipal ordinances pertaining to parking enforcement, job safety included but not limited to OSHA standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7288.009s">Can</a> you tell me, did they follow this contract proviso?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7301.199s">This</a> was supposed to be in October before this contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7305.662s">This</a> is what the contract says. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7307.163s">And</a> this is now what, May?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7312.643s">But</a> before you hire someone, don't you train them? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7314.866s">Before</a> you get a police officer, we just had a student school for them tonight, didn't we? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7319.431s">You</a> didn't hire them off the street to come in here and aggravate the people and be bounty hunter number one or two or three because you collect the most amount of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7327.665s">This</a> is wrong, dead wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7329.226s">And</a> again, as I said to you before, I like you, you're my friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7332.168s">This</a> is not your job. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7333.488s">This</a> was the mayor's job. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7335.409s">You</a> should not be doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7337.371s">I'm</a> here to answer the questions.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7339.532s">And</a> I appreciate it, okay?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7345.915s">Well,</a> maybe we should just abolish it, like I said, and have a nice little, like it was before, start off with a small revenue enforcement program, see how it works, see if that leads into maybe meters if you want to put <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7357.602s">the</a> court is in in the future, which people can understand, not this craziness. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7361.485s">And</a> tell me something. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7362.266s">If</a> I'm out of the state, and I put money in the meter, and it doesn't take my receipt, it doesn't take my license, why should I be subject to a ticket? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7368.39s">Because</a> I'm out of state. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7370.011s">How</a> does this work?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7373.894s">Well,</a> that's the problem here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7375.576s">And</a> that's another way to juice somebody out of $25. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7377.837s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7700.956s">The</a> reason that money got into the bond bill is when the mayor knew that three members of the council weren't going to vote for it, he went to Representative Donato, who never came to us, to explain that they were putting that money into the bond bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7711.418s">So</a> there was no understanding of that money going in by any vote of this council one way or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7716.682s">Did</a> I say that? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7719.144s">Yes,</a> you didn't say that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7814.756s">One</a> last question. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7815.637s">And,</a> um, the hours of operation have now been changed from eight to six. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7820.242s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7820.862s">Monday</a> through Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7822.003s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7822.424s">Can</a> you tell me why the office is not open on a Saturday?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7837.154s">It</a> doesn't work that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7837.914s">There</a> are people that on Saturday is the only day they can make this appointment or see them or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7842.818s">This</a> is not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7843.558s">It's</a> another issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7844.419s">If</a> you can make a notation, ask them to be open on Saturday from 8 to 6, just like they are every other day. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7851.648s">You</a> know, if they're good enough to give out the tickets, they should be good enough to hear their complaints on the same days that they give out their tickets.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8425.535s">I</a> agree somewhat with Councilor Camuso, but, you know, the Board of Appeals has a statutory autonomy, so to speak, to make their own decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8433.9s">But</a> the council has a right to interject what its concerns might be in a particular neighbourhood or a particular section. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8441.343s">We</a> can jump over to another location <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8443.835s">It's</a> on Winthrop Street, right opposite the gas station, where across the street they want to put 11 houses into a four-home unit area over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8451.737s">I</a> mean, I don't know how they're going to do it, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8454.518s">So</a> that's a true encroachment in a particular neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8457.339s">And</a> if the residents don't want it, or they're not even aware of it because <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8463.586s">They</a> just don't either have the time to be bothered with it or to be involved with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8468.93s">I</a> mean, you know, we do have a responsibility if something we feel needs to be communicated to any particular board. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8475.155s">You</a> know, one of the benefits of getting all these notices when these board meetings are, we see what the agendas might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8480.499s">And</a> some of these agendas have worked out for the purposes of having a council go to them and find out what's going on or express their interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8488.085s">Now,</a> I know Councilor Caraviello, this won't be the first time, <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8492.468s">that</a> he would have an interest at the Board of Appeals because, and rightfully so, he had an interest in a piece of property in the West Medford area where the legitimacy of why the building was being sold and what was going to be proposed to be put there was not one and the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8507.735s">And</a> because of his interaction at the board and with the neighborhood, it helped resolve the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8512.778s">So</a> what was going to originally go up and what became after the fact did not really come to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8519.781s">And</a> this might be a combination of the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8522.998s">I</a> don't think anybody should be dissuaded from going to any meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8526.081s">City</a> Council, Board of Appeals, Public Health, Water and Soil Commission meeting, whatever it might be, because if you have your opinion, what difference does it make if you're an elected official or not? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8534.888s">And</a> if you're going as an elected official expressing your opinion, but more importantly, people have expressed their concern to you, and that's the reason why you're going, well, to some degree, that adds some weight, I would assume, in any particular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8547.179s">That's</a> what the board members are there for, to listen to all the opinions that people might have. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8551.528s">While</a> they might be autonomous to make their own decision, they're not precluded from listening to other people's decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8557.691s">I'll</a> strike that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8558.492s">They</a> should not be precluded from listening to other people's decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8562.054s">And</a> that's the reason why we're elected, to listen to the people, hear what they have to say, go to a meeting if we want to go, and express our concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8569.438s">So</a> I agree with you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8571.699s">I</a> don't think there's anything wrong with going to the meeting, expressing your opinion, even if it's contrary to all three members of the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8577.582s">At</a> least you were there to say what you felt.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9085.658s">Madam</a> President, a few weeks ago, we had a little bit of a discussion on the council floor, but firstly, I want to get back to Councilor Caraviello's resolution as it relates to the fabric of the neighborhood, as Councilor Marks has alluded to. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9098.825s">I</a> don't think there's anything wrong with going to any board of appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9101.806s">I've</a> been there many times through the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9103.367s">I've</a> been to many boards during the courses of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9106.508s">I've</a> gone and spoken as a citizen and as an elected official, and 90% of the time when I've gone, I've been recognized as an elected official in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9114.59s">but</a> coming to speak on the matter whether I was pro or con. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9117.972s">So</a> what makes that any different than a few weeks ago before this council? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9121.894s">We</a> were asked to vote and participate on a private outside contractor who works at Tufts University, their custodial staff, we were asked to take a vote to support them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9135.446s">as</a> it relates to them not losing their jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9138.307s">Something</a> entirely different. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9140.287s">It's</a> got nothing to do with the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9143.548s">We</a> were led to believe they were Tufts University employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9146.608s">They</a> were outside paid contractors. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9148.949s">And</a> by being outside paid contractors, further removed from the whole issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9153.29s">And</a> what did we do? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9154.33s">We</a> took a vote to support them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9156.13s">And</a> something right here in our own building, something that represents the heartbeat of this community where people live, we're going to be precluded from going to any board <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9165.528s">or</a> any meeting and talking to them because we're doing something wrong, we're strong-arming them, you're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9171.454s">What</a> is your opinion? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9172.675s">What</a> does an opinion mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9173.756s">It</a> means to offer what you think in your mind, what the situation might be and what you might want it to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9179.281s">You</a> want to look at the zoning ordinances and look at the criteria and the priority that it needs to take. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9184.146s">If</a> you need some revision, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9186.749s">But</a> to say we're gonna check the zoning first before we even go forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9190.533s">Absolutely,</a> absolutely ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9193.217s">It's</a> the most ridiculous thing that I could hear of. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9195.64s">You're</a> making it sound like we have to just stay in this particular room and we can't go to before any board, any meeting, any commission because it's undue influence. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9203.811s">Well,</a> that's absurd. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9205.362s">absolutely</a> absurd. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9206.823s">It's</a> just as absurd as the vote we took that night to go out of our way to protect outside employees contracted by Tufts University, not even their own employees who we thought that was happening, and we took a vote to make sure to try to protect them to keep their jobs.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9258.805s">President,</a> should we be aware of the fact that in our sheriff's department, they may want to lay off employees, and we should take a vote to make sure that the sheriff keeps all the employees? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9266.687s">Should</a> we do that in every agency that's going out there? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9269.387s">I'm</a> not going to discuss it because that's my place of employment. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9271.528s">Well,</a> that's your place of employment. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9272.788s">So</a> if you were going to get laid off, you'd like to have somebody be there to support you, wouldn't you?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9597.784s">Why</a> would you want to sit down and discuss the ordinances now after Councilor Caraviello brought up something that's a concern if you don't think it's a concern until the Board of Appeals? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9606.55s">I'm</a> going to disagree with all of you except with this particular issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9609.892s">One</a> house can tear down a neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9611.773s">There</a> was a house on Forest Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9614.134s">I'm</a> going to leave the number and the location nameless. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9616.856s">And</a> that house turned out to be a crack house. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9619.297s">And</a> that was causing a tremendous amount of problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9622.599s">So</a> to say that one house or any house, you don't need a quantitative number. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9627.242s">It</a> doesn't have to be 12, 15, or 20. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9628.942s">It</a> can take just one house to bring down a neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9632.264s">And</a> this house almost did it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9757.668s">You</a> missed the point, because you say I'm following you, so maybe you should follow me. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9760.649s">I'm</a> talking about applications that go before the board, not houses that had nothing to do with the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9765.87s">You</a> just said they turn into crack houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9768.231s">Well,</a> the application had to go before the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9770.832s">Talking</a> about applications that went before the board.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=10828.557s">I'd</a> like to refer this to next Tuesday's meeting, please.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=10909.938s">Mr.</a> President, this past week, I can't say you had the opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=10916.98s">This</a> past week you haven't been part of the funeral services for Juan Ramirez. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=10922.761s">And</a> it took place at the Grace Episcopal Church. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=10926.335s">And</a> what was very different about it was the fact that the choir from St. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=10930.357s">Joseph's</a> Church on High Street, as well as the choir from the Grace Episcopal Church joined together for this particular mass service, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=10941.284s">Warren,</a> as everyone knows, sang at both churches, St. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=10945.006s">Joe's</a> and Sacred Heart. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=10947.347s">And</a> very dedicated to both the churches and very dedicated to the people in both those churches. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=10954.385s">fine</a> representative. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=10955.425s">It</a> was an outstanding funeral performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=10958.507s">And</a> Kathleen Beebe, who was the love of his life, there participating with this family, an extremely wonderful lady, strong, who took care of Warren and his mother for many, many years, and just a fine and wonderful lady to be recognized as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=10978.955s">Lastly,</a> anyone who knew Joseph Callahan, who was our former city auditor, <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=10984.07s">He</a> was a very gentle and caring individual. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=10986.952s">He</a> did his job quietly and with professionalism, and he truly personified a true public employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=10993.736s">So</a> to his family, we offer likewise this expression of sympathy.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=11131.681s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=11176.565s">Next</a> Monday, forthcoming Monday, is going to be Memorial Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=11180.286s">And</a> I just want to remind everyone that you're all invited. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=11182.727s">I</a> believe it's 10 o'clock in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=11184.979s">at</a> Oak Grove Cemetery for the services that will be partaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=11189.04s">And</a> it should be a fine day remembering all our veterans, and at the same time, it's a nice way for the community to get out and see each other and say hello.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=11209.105s">In</a> order, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=11211.225s">Move</a> approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=11211.505s">Mr.</a> President, I have a problem.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=11218.987s">I'll</a> discuss it with the maker of the motion and resolve it.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_E2oeLkYbA5Q/2025-03-21_E2oeLkYbA5Q.html">Medford City Council - May 12, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1003.109s">Point</a> of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1005.089s">Point</a> of clarification, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1006.37s">Pursuant</a> to what Councilor Camuso, I had called him up and asked him about that, that resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1010.691s">I</a> believe you brought it up maybe almost two months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1012.811s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1013.531s">They</a> said they never got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1014.411s">They</a> never got the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1016.412s">So</a> I think we need to ask again. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1018.752s">Did</a> you send that out? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1022.21s">No,</a> I believe the resolution was to have it be sent to the MBTA, to their director of public relations for the purposes of can the bus stop be moved.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1339.984s">It</a> didn't go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1341.144s">I'm</a> sorry, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1341.665s">It</a> didn't go through.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1344.326s">The</a> bond bill didn't go through.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1535.238s">Mr.</a> President, before I speak, we have in attendance this evening the president of the state organization from Mass Resistance, Mr. Brian Kamenker. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1545.203s">And</a> I'd like to have him come forward and give his reasoning first before I make my comments.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1873.825s">Mr.</a> President, I want to thank the president for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1878.188s">I</a> think the bill, the intent of the bill needs to be said. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1880.11s">It's</a> to protect school children. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1881.728s">from</a> obscene, sexually graphic, psychologically intrusive surveys conducted by the public schools without parental knowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1888.873s">The</a> surveys also ask you to reveal their criminal activity, personal family matters, and other intimate issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1896.039s">That's</a> the legislation that House Bill number 382 describes itself to. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1902.043s">I</a> have no problem as a city councilor, and hopefully my council colleagues would be supportive of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1907.387s">And</a> I think it's fair to say <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1909.258s">There</a> was an equal representation from both Democrats and Republicans on Beacon Hill who have signed on to support this bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1915.882s">The</a> piece of legislation that you're talking about dating back to, was it 1975, 1978 that you wrote it?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1932.772s">And</a> that piece of legislation is very explicit as it relates to surveys being disseminated by the public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1938.837s">for</a> which parental notification needs to be given before the child either takes the survey or has the opt-out provision that they could take the survey.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1963.166s">It's</a> disturbing, and not to be repetitive, but when they ask questions, how old were you when you first had <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1968.94s">sex,</a> annual, oral, vagina, for the first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1972.001s">And</a> then it says, you know, in the past three months, how many people have you had sex with? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1976.082s">And</a> it goes on to talk about whether you've taken cocaine, heroin. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1979.503s">And</a> it also talks about, do your parents text while they drive? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1982.984s">And</a> there's a whole host of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1984.724s">And</a> I believe, if I understand it correctly in reading the bill and speaking to folks up in the Statehouse on the legislative committee, their concern is when a child goes to school, it's got to be more than making the child be physically safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1997.542s">The</a> child now has to be psychologically, emotionally not disturbed because of going to school and taking these type of surveys. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2005.527s">And</a> so to do that, they feel that this type of legislation would at least put the parent on an equal playing field. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2012.631s">At</a> least they would be advised of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2014.392s">Now</a> here in the city of Medford, I know you said, I think the survey was given in 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2018.474s">And</a> some parents, again, once they find out after the fact, it's too late after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2025.118s">I</a> think another problem with these surveys, and some of these kids who are much younger, when they go to answer it, they may not know how to answer it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2031.923s">And</a> they may just be writing all kinds of numbers that can escalate, yeah, 1, 5, 4, without really knowing. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2037.967s">Maybe</a> they don't even understand what the questions mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2040.409s">How</a> do you get somebody in the fourth, fifth, and the sixth grade to understand all of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2045.032s">Yes,</a> today, they may be more advanced because of what's on television and what's in the movies and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2049.615s">But</a> some of this stuff is really personal. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2051.877s">And</a> it's something that is a parental responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2054.18s">It's</a> their responsibility to make sure that their child understands what's on here if they are going to take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2059.581s">So</a> with that being said, it's not appropriate for the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2064.222s">I</a> don't think it's appropriate for any school, public, private, or whatever, to make any decision on behalf of something that a parent has a responsibility and should have control over. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2073.785s">A</a> kid should not have to go to school, have that survey, and have the teacher say, we have to take this survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2079.386s">And</a> the parents have absolutely no idea on that particular day that that survey was given. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2084.304s">And</a> I think that's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2086.225s">And</a> I applaud you, and I applaud your organization and your efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2089.307s">And,</a> you know, there's a state rep up from Lowell. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2092.229s">His</a> name is Randy Mom. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2094.491s">And</a> I believe he's a foreigner who immigrated here to this country, and unfortunate enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2098.674s">And</a> he said, this type of a survey is almost communistic, because he comes from a country, I believe it was Cambodia, and these are the type of questions that they would have to deal with.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2116.451s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2117.972s">And</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I believe both chairpresidents from the House and Senate are not only in favor of it, but they appreciate the testimony that was given because it's being talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2128.038s">And</a> maybe this can be sent back to the State Department of Education that you cannot. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2132.722s">I</a> mean, if you want to have these type of surveys to go out, communities and parents <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2138.062s">need</a> to be informed ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2139.503s">The</a> parent needs to see the survey, not be informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2142.205s">They</a> need to see the survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2143.046s">Do</a> you want your child to take the survey? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2145.047s">And</a> either they opt out or they opt in, one way or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2147.569s">But</a> for what purpose it serves, I don't know, other than the fact that you're going to have some of these results turn around. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2153.274s">And</a> if I understand it correctly, in some cities and towns, these surveys were supposed to be anonymous, if I understood it correctly, but some people were identified by a number.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2173.222s">And</a> that doesn't speak well for a school system that allows that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2176.583s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I would move, and again, I would hope that the city council would support House Bill 382. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2184.204s">I'll</a> read it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2185.265s">It's</a> to protect schoolchildren from obscene, sexually graphic, psychologically intrusive surveys conducted by the public schools without <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2192.279s">parental</a> knowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2193.44s">These</a> surveys also seek to ask you to reveal their criminal activity, personal family matters, and other intimate issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2200.943s">And</a> it's House Bill 382. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2203.325s">That's</a> the bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2204.185s">It's</a> up in — there was heard on, I believe, on May 6th. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2207.907s">It</a> was a full House. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2208.747s">You</a> had — you had mothers there, you had single parents there, over and beyond mass resistance, and you had legislatures who spoke white, quite frankly, in favor of this because <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2220.123s">You</a> know, this is something that just needs to be stopped before it gets out of hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2223.424s">So</a> that's the motion.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2269.722s">Well,</a> this is what the bill is, in essence. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2271.123s">It's</a> right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2271.663s">I</a> mean, I just read it to you what the gut of the bill is.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2469.971s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2471.292s">Just</a> as a point of clarification to Councilor Camuso's comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2473.894s">Point</a> of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2476.276s">We</a> have filed bills here from the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2478.671s">that</a> have made radical changes by the time it came out. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2482.333s">All</a> I'm talking about is the intent of what the bill wants to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2486.055s">If</a> the bill has to be amended, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2488.536s">It</a> may not even come out of committee, but it looks like it will come out of committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2491.598s">The</a> intent of this is to protect schoolchildren, but the law is very specific, as it's written right now, that parents, when surveys such as this are going to be disseminated, the parents need to be <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2504.057s">told</a> ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2505.777s">Schools</a> cannot just go out there and do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2508.338s">And</a> that's what the intent of this bill is. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2510.898s">So</a> all I'm asking you for is to support the intent of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2514.619s">Then</a> they can add it up, but to add it down after that, it's letting people know that, you know, if you want your child protected from this type of pornography in plain English, you know, now's the time to speak up. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2526.702s">Councilor</a> Camuso.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2597.486s">Councilor</a> Knight just made a remark that it's a hate organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2602.109s">If</a> it was such a hate organization, they wouldn't even be entertaining this on Beacon Hill, and they wouldn't be getting the support from both sides of the aisle. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2608.394s">But</a> to say that they're a hate organization, I don't see anything in front of me that says they're a hate organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2612.237s">That's</a> your opinion, for what you maybe read someplace.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2861.089s">The</a> gentleman at the podium, you indicated, sir, that the city of Medford in 2013 gave up that survey, correct?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2875.318s">And</a> that survey that was given out, parents weren't advised ahead of time.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2887.875s">And</a> they didn't see that survey before their child took it?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2966.179s">On</a> the motion, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2968.24s">The</a> lady that just spoke, I wholeheartedly disagree with her because number one, to say that the responsibility is on the parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2974.042s">The</a> responsibility can be not be on the parent if the parent doesn't know what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2977.784s">The</a> responsibility is within the public school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2980.425s">If</a> that's where these surveys are being disseminated through by the State Department of Education and they disseminate it to a public school, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2986.69s">And</a> then that has to go down to the student. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2988.491s">The</a> parents should be informed ahead of time that this type of a survey, and they should be able to read it ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2993.915s">So</a> that way, their decision is informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2996.377s">You</a> can't take a fourth, a fifth, or a sixth grader and have them sign a survey or take a survey without a parent knowing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3003.181s">That's</a> wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3004.302s">That's</a> the whole intent behind this piece of legislation, to inform the parent ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3009.685s">And</a> that's what the law is, Chapter 71, Section 32A. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3013.448s">That's</a> what it says, and unfortunately, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3015.41s">Cities</a> and towns are not following the rules as they should. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3018.011s">There's</a> a motion before us.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3104.225s">I</a> can revert to it, and support the intent of House Bill 382, which is to protect children from obscene, sexually graphic, and psychologically intrusive service. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3116.638s">I</a> have it here for you, Eddie.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3178.807s">Um,</a> let me see. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3184.911s">City,</a> the city of Medford city council go on record to support house bill three eight two, which is to protect chill school children from obscene sexually graphic <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3210.114s">It's</a> 283. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3210.494s">It's</a> 283. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3216.699s">Is</a> it? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3218.16s">House</a> Bill 283, to protect school children from obscene, sexually graphic, psychologically intrusive surveys conducted by the public schools without parental knowledge.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3230.03s">To</a> support the intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3231.171s">To</a> support the intent, not to support the bill.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3239.53s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3890.594s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3890.934s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3891.955s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3893.236s">If</a> I understand this correctly, I'm speaking with Mr. Baudelaire. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3896.32s">We're</a> short about $70,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3898.081s">I</a> think that's the dollar amount we need to get to.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3943.481s">The</a> inclusion of the 70, whatever the amount might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3947.383s">Well,</a> there's nothing to be voted on tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3948.824s">We</a> don't have a number to be taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3949.944s">So</a> we're going to get a report. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3950.725s">We're</a> going to ask the director. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3953.226s">But</a> if I remember correctly, I think it's the city's portion of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3956.918s">And</a> if, in fact, any major development does take place to put that second floor on, as Councilor Marks has alluded to, the $70,000 would be more than enough to be included, or whatever the dollar amount might be, because the purpose of using it for the city and the city's usefulness will far exceed, you know, the dollar amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3973.052s">The</a> dollar amount will be included because that's the work that'll have to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3976.554s">So</a> I support it, but I just, see, that's the unfortunate part. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3980.358s">Whatever</a> the number might be, you need to have the exact number. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3983.62s">And</a> that just goes to show you, once again, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3986.233s">The</a> city council asked, we've asked each and every year that when a budget is presented to us, we get the information ahead of time or we sit down with department heads and ask them for what their wish list is as to why. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3999.318s">And</a> then the other day, most recently the mayor's publicist who works up at the high school as a teacher sends out a press release that said the city council school committee have been hearing from department heads over the past several weeks in a series of pre-budget meetings <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4013.753s">The</a> entire budget will be before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4015.854s">We've</a> never met with the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4017.455s">We</a> haven't even met with a department head. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4020.016s">And</a> this is what you get when you have an administration that is so out of control as his own personal publicist was a teacher up at the high school with her own private newspaper writing stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4031.24s">And</a> when people read that, that's what's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4033.441s">This</a> is wrong information. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4035.042s">We</a> haven't met with anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4036.242s">We</a> haven't even met amongst ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4038.303s">We</a> just got the numbers tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4040.524s">So</a> how can you put in a newspaper article, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4042.994s">that</a> we've been meeting for weeks with the school committee and with department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4046.556s">I</a> wish that were the case, but it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4049.138s">And</a> that's why this city gets itself in trouble, a huge lack of communication and miscommunication. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4055.081s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4566.637s">A</a> $154 million budget and we have to use a portable mic. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4570.68s">Anyway.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4572.841s">The</a> gentleman that's in the, it was the last time, it's been fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4577.725s">The</a> gentleman that's gonna receive this award also is one of our two videographers for the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4584.53s">And</a> he's coming out now in full regalia. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4591.214s">All</a> right, here he comes. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4602.403s">You</a> know, this is the best part about being an elected official, because you don't take a vote on something like this and you can't get hurt. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4607.728s">You're</a> here to give a commendation to someone who really deserves it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4611.331s">He's</a> worked hard since 2007. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4613.373s">He</a> got himself involved in paramedics, EMT, Cataldo Ambulance Company, and he's worked his way up. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4620.279s">And</a> he's recognized at work, especially for being a hard worker, conscientious, dedicated, and a true example to his fellow <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4628.647s">workers,</a> male and female, and there's the Star of Life right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4633.45s">It's</a> an award, it's not local, this is a national award, so this is what makes this very, very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4639.055s">This</a> is the resolution offered by the city council to Richard Cormier, Star of Life recipient and award from the American Ambulance Association, national. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4652.064s">Paramedic</a> Ricky Cormier, receiving nominations <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4655.27s">For</a> both his work in the field and in the dispatch center, Ricky is sometimes someone who mirrors professionalism. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4661.593s">He's</a> well respected, experienced, and dependable. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4664.895s">He</a> works proactively to resolve issues and constantly seeks improvement for himself, those around him, and Catalgo Ambulance Service. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4673.779s">Ricky</a> has a positive attitude while collaborating with coworkers and customers to deliver quality patient care <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4680.352s">and</a> customer service, both as a medic and dispatcher. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4684.055s">Often</a> he can be seen responding to requests to fill a difficult shift on a truck or in a dispatch or on weekends and late evenings to help out. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4692.821s">The</a> Medford City Council congratulates Ricky Cormier on being the 2015 recipient of the Stars of Life Award by the American Ambulance Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4703.608s">Again,</a> he's one of many that just seems to keep surfacing week in and week out <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4709.775s">of</a> individuals in our community that are just not only well respected, they're recognized for what they do, and I would hope that this becomes, Mr. Newspaper Man, wherever you are, a front page story, because this is what you call a true recognition for an award.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4987.818s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4988.298s">Good</a> luck.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5200.331s">Mr.</a> President, I think on April 8th we received a document from the Cemetery Board of Trustees regarding the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5206.662s">And</a> inclusive of that meeting, there was a notation from Louise Miller that indicated that a bid for construction for a public mausoleum at Oak Grove Cemetery had three responders. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5218.489s">Medford</a> City Council for years has been talking about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5221.931s">And</a> I just really feel to some degree, once again, it's the administration just ignoring the council, keeping us not only out of the loop, but completely unaware of what's going on in the loop. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5231.537s">And</a> the fact of the matter is, now that you're down to three bidders and evaluating these firms, I think the council wanted to have a discussion on mausoleums, where they would be in the cemetery, having an open public forum for people to come and then also meet with the Board of Cemetery Trustees about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5249.902s">This</a> seems like it's almost like it's a done deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5252.643s">I</a> mean, nobody has any idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5254.063s">I</a> mean, people, when I go to the cemetery, ask me where the mausoleum is. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5257.544s">And</a> I say, what mausoleum? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5258.384s">I</a> don't know anything about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5260.565s">And</a> that's what started this whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5261.886s">And</a> then when I went back through my papers and I saw this thing, which is dated April 8, I just think, you know, there was something wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5271.27s">I</a> mean, why is this council not being told on issues which generated from them? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5277.734s">This</a> isn't even something that we have never even talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5280.475s">This</a> has been on here for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5282.676s">We've</a> asked, and it was going to be considered. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5285.238s">And</a> then we were going to get total that would be brought back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5288.311s">We</a> have our discussions every time during our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5291.793s">And</a> now we have the trustees will now read the proposals, evaluate them, and rank them, and then a follow-up meeting will be discussed, which is in May. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5299.656s">I</a> would like to have, Mr. President, I'd like to move that the Board of Trustees meet with the Medford City Council for the purposes of discussing the mausoleums that are being suggested for Oak Grove Cemetery.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5318.168s">I</a> don't really care who's the governing. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5319.73s">I</a> just think the City Council, where this was all initiated from, deserves at least some kind of respect in return to saying, as a follow-up, it's quite similar to what Councilor Camuso just talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5331.859s">The</a> answer is B paper before the A paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5334.34s">Well,</a> we talk about the mausoleums and the city goes ahead and do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5338.043s">They</a> have bids that go out and they have proposals to come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5341.002s">That's</a> not to say there's anything wrong with it, but where is it going to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5343.783s">What</a> part of the cemetery? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5345.224s">You</a> know, we are an integral part of this community, and we do fund the cemetery through our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5351.967s">So</a> I think there is a duty of respect that's owed to the council.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5619.044s">Mr.</a> President, last Thursday at 2 o'clock in the afternoon in this council chamber, an ascertainment hearing took place and it's related to the Comcast contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5629.773s">that</a> I believed everybody in the room that day, except the gentleman, Mr. Epstein, who was sitting up conducting the hearing, knew that the hearing or the date of April 18th, which was the ending date of the city's contract with Comcast, had been extended to July. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5645.917s">Now,</a> unbeknownst to all of us until we were speaking at the podium on that day, oh, let me preface this by saying there wasn't one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5652.259s">There</a> wasn't one person here from the city administration to speak on the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5657.007s">to</a> defend it, to defend the taxpayers, the ratepayers within this community, to the concerns that they might have as it relates to all of these particular issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5664.874s">And</a> as a result of that, there was seven or eight citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5667.936s">Some</a> spoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5668.557s">Some</a> didn't speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5669.317s">I</a> think six of them did speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5671.059s">And</a> a lot of the major concerns were as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5673.961s">But</a> I just want to, you know, there was a certified mail sent by the mayor of this community on April 16th, two days before, two days before, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5683.99s">the</a> deadline, which was April 18. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5685.93s">And</a> according to the federal law, which supersedes state law, this continuance takes place until July 3 of this year coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5694.472s">So</a> residents who have any concerns as it relates to Comcast, the renewal of the cable contract, have up until May 21 to submit their formal complaints to the mayor of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5705.475s">And</a> they will be officially forwarded to the State Cable Commission in Boston and to Mr. Peter Epstein <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5712.458s">who</a> is the paid legal consultant for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5716.861s">But</a> some of the comments that were made, number one, the 10-year contract, way, way, way too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5722.405s">Another</a> part of the comments were the issuing authority taking it out of the mayor's hands and putting it into the legislative body, like it is in some other cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5730.651s">There's</a> no senior citizen discount. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5732.773s">The</a> increase in cost just keeps going up each and every year as it relates to Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5737.296s">And</a> with the new addition, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5739.008s">of</a> the technology that's out there between Amazon and Apple and a whole host of other individuals in this business, a 10-year contract would serve no purpose for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5750.698s">A</a> three to a five-year contract seems to be something that would be palatable and it would be something that could possibly be written that could find itself with renewable terminology. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5759.825s">Also,</a> there was no explanation because it never took place of any survey that ever took place here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5768.935s">with</a> Comcast customers over the past 10 years, whether they were satisfied, dissatisfied, or what they would like to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5775.617s">Also,</a> there was no mention of the fact that the mass cable division indicates that ascertainment hearings need to take place within 12 months prior to the expiration date, but no later than six months prior to. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5791.202s">We</a> never had that within 12 months, and we never had that within six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5795.583s">That's</a> not from me. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5796.364s">That's</a> from the cable division form <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5798.302s">100</a> and that's part of their proceeding operating procedures Also, we have the discussion on the particular perks are in kind benefits that this mayor has received as a result of having this contract with Comcast what was indicated at that meeting there were 52 cities and towns throughout the country or 52 mares for which we were one of them that wrote a letter in support of having a merger between Time Warner and Comcast <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5825.88s">The</a> mayor was quoted in picture form in the magazines that proffer the cable industry as being a shill for Comcast, because number one, he received on an annual basis $2,500 for his annual golf tournament, and he got $10,000 a year for his celebrations committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5848.618s">That</a> in and of itself <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5849.992s">was</a> a concern because no one else, no rate payer has that opportunity to get that for whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5856.634s">Also,</a> there needed to be a complete review of the records of the public access corporation, minutes of the meeting, financial records, bank accounts, and all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5867.258s">That</a> has never taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5868.899s">Comcast</a> themselves have never taken the opportunity to review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5872.62s">They've</a> never taken an inventory of the PEG facilities, and they haven't looked at the lifespan of the equipment that they have at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5879.135s">And</a> there was no strategic plan to be presented for the PEG programming as a result of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5884.8s">And</a> the access corporation, in and of itself, needs to be in good standing by having its annual reports and its financial filings and its proper forms in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, for which they don't have. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5896.309s">These</a> are all things that Comcast has not done as it relates to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5900.192s">Comcast</a> has not had any public hearings themselves to encourage commentary from people, from the citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5906.858s">It</a> was brought up at that meeting that the city council voted on two separate occasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5911.18s">One,</a> to have the public hearing and two, to have the public hearing at a reasonable time, which would have been two o'clock in the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5918.984s">What</a> the mayor decided to do was to have, he canceled out the first meeting on a Thursday and forwarded to the next Thursday meeting, which was last week, and still had it at two o'clock in the afternoon because there was hardly anybody here. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5931.731s">People</a> were working. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5932.793s">And</a> some people who were here, including myself, felt that that was a slight. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5936.415s">And</a> it was a slight. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5937.135s">It</a> was slight to the rate payers within this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5939.576s">There</a> was nothing by way of a document that would indicate that a survey was taken by Comcast for the purposes of ascertaining community needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5949.0s">And</a> the results of the survey were not included or submitted to the issuing authority in this particular case was the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5956.931s">Usually</a> the way it will go, the town usually sends out an RFP, or in this particular case, if we're talking about a renewal to the contract, then that renewal to the contract generally takes about 30 to 90 days for the issuing authority to review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5971.155s">And</a> then four months after the issuing authority reviews it, the proposal from the cable contractor or the operator at that point in time can once again be received. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5982.098s">The</a> city does not have to accept it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5983.678s">The</a> city can send it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5984.779s">The</a> city can reject it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5986.223s">or</a> they can consider the contract in a shorter term of period and time. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5991.104s">The</a> new legislative landscape on this particular negotiation on long-term contracts has now been considered to be anywhere from three to five to seven years. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6000.986s">I</a> think that would be something that could be palatable if the terminology was written in there that, inclusive of that language, there would be a review done by Comcast for the things that we talked about that they haven't been doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6015.28s">The</a> commercial districts were brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6016.92s">Councilor</a> Marks' indication relative the lack of connectivity to certain parts of the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6022.382s">That</a> was brought up, that was a point brought up I believe by two other individuals as well as myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6027.064s">That</a> in and of itself really showed that Comcast has not gone out of its way for the purposes of connectivity. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6032.885s">Again,</a> it's another failing on their part to make sure that the city was completely and totally hooked up for Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6040.508s">They</a> indicated also too, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6042.583s">that</a> the reducing of INET expenses or negotiating for cable modem installations, which is more and the least costly, could be challenged by the 6 megahertz channels, which are high-definition channels to the cable operator. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6058.668s">There</a> was also the request that we could avoid agreeing with the cable operator's right to reclaim unused channel time. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6065.91s">That's</a> one thing I believe that Comcast has done through the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6069.471s">If</a> a cable channel is not being used, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6072.385s">They've</a> reclaimed it, and they've put it into a higher tier. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6075.427s">Those</a> are some of the issues in an overview that took place in that particular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6080.51s">Once</a> again, if anybody — oh, yeah, strike that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6084.572s">And</a> also, lastly, performance review hearings, a request to hold hearings on an annual or as-needed basis, contractually obligate the cable operator's attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6094.503s">That</a> has never been done by Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6097.565s">So</a> these were the things, these were the nuts and bolts, these were the ingredients that were talked about and presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6102.628s">There</a> was a stenography here, and I don't know if I'm gonna wait to make sure that you recorded everything, because I will be submitting a copy of what I just got through talking about, but anyone who might be watching who has a displeasure or a pleasure, whether you like them or don't like them, you can write to the mayor of the city as the issuing authority, and tell them what you think on or before May 24th, because that will then be submitted, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6124.803s">to</a> the Mass Cable Regulatory Agency. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6127.284s">And</a> then at that point in time, I believe the city will then go into the process of negotiating. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6133.726s">Another</a> part of the comment that was made to Mr. Epstein was the fact that since the mayor will no longer be the mayor, that we ask that no contract become operative and effective until next year after a new mayor has been selected to give that person the opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6147.612s">Gave</a> the example of the same situation taking place right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6151.357s">where</a> the Director of Public Works, when they went through the whole process, they're now not hiring a Director of Public Works. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6156.438s">They're</a> waiting for the new mayor to come on board so that mayor can do the hiring of the Public Works. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6161.039s">With</a> that being said, Mr. President, I believe that's somewhat of a general overview of what took place at the hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6168.38s">And</a> once again, I just think it was an out and out shame that the mayor refused to have that hearing at nighttime to give many citizens an opportunity to come and speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6176.918s">and</a> to relate their concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6178.759s">You</a> know, if you're going out of office and you really want to leave the ship, why would you want to do that to the taxpayers of this community? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6185.161s">I</a> don't know why, but unfortunately he did. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6187.682s">But</a> at least some of us had an opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6189.903s">And</a> I will leave by saying the following, not one person who represents this city, administration or otherwise, came to that meeting to express their concerns, complaints, compliments, or what have you, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6202.801s">in</a> behalf of the cable TV subscribers, and that was a damn shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6206.482s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6209.103s">I</a> was there, yes.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6214.224s">No,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6215.004s">The</a> motion is going to be to have anybody who has a concern as it relates to Comcast, whether they're for it or against it, for or against the 10-year contract, to write their concerns to the issuing authority as it presently stands, which is the mayor, for the purposes of having them duly recorded before any contract is signed.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6237.625s">Or</a> negotiated for.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6476.585s">I</a> also included as part of the documents resolutions 15 306 15 393 and 15 434 these are the three resolutions from the council and <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6486.548s">making</a> the request not to go into a 10-year contract and making the request that the hearings take place at 2 o'clock in the afternoon 15 15 306 15 393 and 15 434 You got it 15 306 15 393 and 15 434 434 So on that motion all those in favor roll call vote
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6555.598s">The</a> public to forward to the mayor's office.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6560.04s">Any</a> compliments for or against issues as it relates to the Comcast renewal.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6565.282s">On</a> or before May 21st and before any contract negotiations.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6601.83s">Well,</a> the reason why the resolution is coming up now, because the extension that, um, the extension that Mr., um, that the mayor sent out on April 16th, he sent this by certified mail and facsimile. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6614.11s">and</a> this is an addendum to that for which it took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6618.132s">And</a> as Mr. Kelly said, any and all information, they welcome it because this is what they have to negotiate on.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6663.258s">No,</a> he can't do that anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6664.759s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6665.14s">The</a> thing is, all papers for or against have to be submitted to the mayor on or before <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6670.782s">May</a> 21st, that's the deadline for filing, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6673.865s">This</a> contract goes to July 3rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6676.048s">Subsequent</a> to May 21st and after July 3rd, that's when the mayor, who are, if he so chooses, to go forward and negotiate a contract, this is all the information we want included. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6686.459s">This</a> is what Mr. Kelly said. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6687.96s">As</a> much as you give them and send forth between now and then, they have to consider that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6692.79s">So</a> we're adding July date to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6696.372s">July</a> 3rd is the extension date.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6720.245s">That's</a> your opinion.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6726.115s">No,</a> we're not letting him enter into a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6727.656s">What</a> you're doing is you have to read the law, and the law is very specific as it relates to this particular contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6733.2s">He</a> has now signed the extension. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6734.6s">By</a> having the extension signed and having the ascertainment hearing after the fact, not before the fact, that has presented multiple of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6743.146s">Before,</a> you or I or nobody had any opportunity <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6746.581s">to</a> explain or express ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6749.122s">Now,</a> since they had the ascertainment hearing, even though it's after the fact, this all has to be taken in consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6754.724s">So</a> if you don't want to vote for it, vote.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6760.645s">Well,</a> maybe they're reaffirming its position because nobody came here. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6764.266s">So</a> at least we want to reaffirm. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6765.867s">You</a> don't want to vote for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6766.527s">You</a> don't have to vote for it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6780.366s">It's</a> not being disposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6781.427s">What</a> you're doing is you're amending the original one and it's an entirely different resolution.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6889.122s">Very</a> good.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6900.346s">So</a> the vote on the comment section first.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7012.0s">Um,</a> 15 Oh 83 was, it was, was presented before the city council some two months ago and the unfortunate part about it, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7024.282s">as</a> we're starting to go through all these resolutions that are not being responded to. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7027.603s">I</a> don't know why either the mayor or the city engineer has refused to do this, refused to respond to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7035.065s">85</a> cities and towns have now signed on to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7038.546s">Today</a> I attended a mass municipal board meeting and one of their highlights is this MS for permitting part of this permitting process that the EPA is forthcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7052.246s">As</a> a matter of fact, today it was recognized for the first time that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is complementing cities and towns who are taking a stand on this particular position and challenging the EPA, the federal EPA, on this particular mandate, which is not only going to be costly, it's going to be almost prohibitive for the city and town to do this within the next five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7073.133s">It's</a> an excess of 13, I believe, over $20 billion <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7078.968s">entity</a> as it's going to relate upon the entire Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7083.569s">This</a> is nothing more than having our city engineer write a letter in support of our community, sister communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7091.61s">She</a> doesn't believe what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7093.471s">We're</a> a member of MMA. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7094.651s">She</a> can call them up and ask them, you know, what it's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7097.792s">She</a> can check in with their environmental committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7100.352s">You</a> know, all we're doing is requesting the APA that since the proposed MS4 stormwater <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7106.213s">sewer</a> system permit would require communities to institute more advanced stormwater testing, monitoring, and management programs, but is completely silent on funding or mitigation of the additional costs to communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7119.143s">And</a> since there is no flexibility in the compliance portion of the requirements, and since communities are grappling with these huge financial challenges, with preliminary projections to be in excess of $800,000 per year per community, we ask the EPA to defer action on their submission <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7136.437s">of</a> a notice of intent until municipalities have had the opportunity to engage the regulatory agencies in an open dialogue regarding these onerous and unaffordable permit requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7147.743s">And</a> then it goes on and explains and it gives a whole list of these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7151.205s">And</a> I just don't understand why we have not received. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7153.927s">I</a> think it was Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7155.228s">I</a> think in the beginning you sort of like okayed with that and you said, can we just send it upstairs and let's see if we can get an answer back. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7161.291s">Well,</a> we haven't gotten an answer back from her. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7163.86s">And</a> this is too important of an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7165.661s">They</a> did a survey of Massachusetts cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7168.303s">This</a> was their second highest priority through Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7172.566s">Municipal</a> Association, for which we are a paid dues member within that community. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7178.75s">This</a> is huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7180.391s">This</a> is huge as it relates to an infrastructure problem here in the city of Medford, as it relates to our water and sewer, especially our stormwater and sewer provisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7190.157s">This</a> is a very aggressive attitude. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7192.682s">being</a> taken by the EPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7195.023s">What</a> the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is doing, and the Baker administration, and the Commonwealth's EPA program, they're asking for a long-term, at least a minimum, of a 20-year program that forecasts out cities and towns to go at this at a reasonable pace and at a reasonable cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7211.714s">The</a> city of Medford cannot afford $800,000 a year to correct all its stormwater provisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7216.917s">That's</a> minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7217.958s">Could</a> even be more on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7219.859s">We</a> have things going on upstairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7222.463s">in</a> our water and sewer department that's going to be costing us probably into the millions with a new program that they're going to be coming up on a leak detection program. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7230.049s">And</a> then when we look at that, how's the priority run against that against this? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7234.393s">Mr.</a> President, I'm asking that we as a city or our Medford City Council go forward with a letter of support, forward this to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts EBA and letting them know that we support their proposal <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7249.233s">for</a> forecasting this over a longer period of time, having an educational program for which there is none being offered by the federal EPA, and at the same time, give cities and towns an opportunity to forecast their financial program to engage in this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7266.503s">Also,</a> there are five coalitions of eastern Massachusetts towns, which make up over 85 communities that surround us that are looking into combining their services, their expertise, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7277.972s">and</a> whatever it takes to reduce the individual city and town burden to get through this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7284.036s">So</a> again, going through all our resolutions that haven't been answered, there's a whole host of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7289.899s">If</a> this is the mayor's intent to just leave and just ignore this council or have a department head ignore this council on this most important issue, shame on all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7298.344s">This</a> is too important an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7300.005s">It</a> affects every single taxpayer, water and soil projection, water and soil rate payer, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7305.087s">in</a> this particular community. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7306.349s">So</a> I ask approval, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7309.111s">And</a> if you want, I'll read the entire resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7311.614s">No</a> thanks.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7322.005s">In</a> the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7323.627s">Yes,</a> that's the exact text.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7406.358s">Mr.</a> President, with all due respect to the city engineer who's had this for over two months and not being responsive to it, as well as other issues that are sitting up there, I just think, and I don't understand <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7415.339s">If</a> Councilor Knight has a problem with the words, what's the problem with the words?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7434.783s">How</a> can it be? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7435.463s">Well,</a> read the language. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7436.383s">You're</a> just using terminology. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7437.824s">What</a> words don't you like? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7439.224s">What</a> sentence don't you like in here?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7450.959s">Right</a> now, in the federal government, there is an absence of leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7454.681s">There</a> is nobody there at the helm for the purposes of making this a direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7458.064s">So</a> this is coming from Washington down. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7460.325s">And</a> if you talk to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7467.47s">I</a> feel like it starts to soften more. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7468.53s">I've</a> got to move, Mr. President, move on the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7470.732s">Move</a> the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7471.953s">I</a> don't think it's argumentative. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7473.053s">I</a> think it needs to be done.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7478.043s">Roll</a> call vote, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7526.414s">All</a> those opposed?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8793.186s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing that up, but I would also like to, we haven't got a response back to the scuttlebutt that seems to be now emanating more and more of some kind of a merger between the high school and the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8805.175s">And</a> I think we need to report back from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8806.796s">There</a> was a school committee person here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8808.857s">I</a> thought she was going to talk on it, but I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8810.759s">She</a> left, but that's neither here or there. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8813.22s">I</a> think it's very important to note if in fact, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8815.817s">And</a> from what I understand, this is emanating from the high school side, not from the vocational school side. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8821.138s">So</a> a lot of the teachers in the vocational school are pretty upset over the fact that, you know, they haven't been put into the loop. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8825.939s">They</a> haven't been part of the discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8827.859s">So</a> if vocational education is going to survive in the city of Medford, it just needs to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8832.46s">I</a> think the community needs to know what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8835.221s">For</a> whatever the proposal might be and the discussions that might be going on, you have to put all the parties together. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8840.462s">We</a> asked for a joint meeting with the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8842.162s">They've</a> yet to respond. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8843.763s">They</a> probably won't respond because they don't want to answer the questions when we ask them. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8847.324s">These</a> are hard questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8849.064s">And</a> if it's a proposal and it sounds good, well, let's all hear about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8852.485s">But</a> I don't think in a maze of an executive decision or executive administrators, they make this decision, and the whole vocational school now becomes an entirely different territory, so to speak, as compared to what the high school has to offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8866.328s">So</a> again, Mr. Clark, I know you have it on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8868.728s">I'll</a> probably repeat my request again, that we get a report back, what, if anything, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8874.353s">is</a> the issue regarding a merger use between the high school and the vocational school as it relates to an incorporation of these classes, because that's what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8886.982s">The</a> word seems to be they're only going to keep three of the vocational school courses that are certified by the Commonwealth, and the rest just become electives to some degree that a kid from the high school can take and have it merge. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8899.712s">And</a> that, to me, would just destroy the whole <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8901.943s">idea</a> of vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8903.084s">And</a> then what are you going to do about all these kids that go to Minuteman? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8906.345s">I</a> mean, where's the increased cost that they're going to take place if we start shipping kids to another vocational school because we're not going to be offering them the full-time services of a vocational school? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8916.35s">So</a> I think it's paramount we get an answer back. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8919.812s">They</a> can have the certification. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8921.053s">They</a> deserve the certification. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8922.714s">They</a> work for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8923.834s">But</a> now if it's a new day dawn coming up to be, I think we need to know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8933.322s">And</a> also, Mr. President, during this past week, there was a fire up at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8938.743s">And</a> to the best of my knowledge, unfortunately, the fire department does not have a knock spark system that they used to have, which would have enabled them to get into the building without breaking windows and going through. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8950.126s">And</a> also, if we're on this whole issue of the high school, why is there a full time <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8957.117s">fireperson</a> there because the fire alarm system still is inoperative, I believe, on the third floor of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8964.48s">These</a> are important questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8966.02s">Do</a> you realize what the cost is to put a fireman there every single day to be a watchdog because the alarm systems aren't working or isn't working like it's supposed to concurrently, you know, within the whole building? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8978.465s">Can</a> we get a report back on this, Mr. President, if we make these side papers, if you want B and C papers?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9427.685s">On</a> March 11th of this past year, just two months, we had a resolution that was passed unanimously by this council for the purposes of getting an update as to what's going on as it relates to the remediation of the parking lot in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9442.156s">We</a> still haven't heard anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9443.577s">As</a> Councilor Caraviello will attest to, we've heard numbers range anywhere <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9447.101s">from</a> $2 million to almost $7, $8, $9 million to have this thing remediated. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9452.142s">Come</a> to find out that supposedly on March 14, two days later, excuse me, on March 13, a meeting did take place with the Director of Energy and Environment as it relates to the brownfields, the dirt contamination, the cleanup efforts, and the buildings that have been affected in West Medford in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9477.53s">Now,</a> we know we have a mayor that's going out of office. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9479.931s">He's</a> made that announcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9482.553s">You</a> have a budget director that's going to be leaving at the end of the week, because that person is deciding to try to go to other places. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9490.277s">And</a> we have a multimillion-dollar issue facing us right here, again, with no resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9497.32s">This</a> is not making any sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9499.842s">There's</a> a time schedule that was proposed way back when as to what would take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9504.424s">We</a> were told that we would be kept into the loop. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9506.545s">We</a> were told the public hearings that would take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9509.847s">And</a> part of the report that was submitted on March 13th indicates there was additional work that must be done to meet EPA requirements before a preferred work plan can be presented to the occupants of the buildings and to the general public in that particular parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9525.196s">Now,</a> we haven't seen or heard anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9528.038s">And</a> it's just not making any sense at all, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9531.58s">The</a> last time we got an update was August 11, 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9536.217s">Now</a> we're talking about March of 2015, and we still have no response as to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9546.162s">So</a> I don't know where we're going with all of this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9549.143s">I</a> really think we need to be apprised as to what is going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9553.985s">Excuse</a> me, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9555.386s">It's</a> March of 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9557.106s">The</a> last time we had any communication was August of 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9562.569s">So</a> we're well over six, seven, eight months <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9566.033s">and</a> not getting any response. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9567.614s">We're</a> not getting anything as with the state DEP or the EPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9572.996s">We're</a> getting no cost proposals or anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9575.077s">So</a> again, why are the department heads just refusing to answer us? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9579.94s">Why</a> is the mayor doing this? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9582.381s">He's</a> leaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9582.941s">He</a> doesn't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9584.022s">It's</a> quite obvious he hasn't cared for a long period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9587.443s">But</a> the taxpayers need to know because this is going to cost them. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9590.885s">It's</a> going to be out of their pocket one way or the other if we don't get any bonds <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9595.263s">or</a> we don't get any federal, we don't get any state money. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9599.445s">I</a> don't know, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9601.946s">You</a> know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9602.946s">I'd</a> like to move that we have Alicia Hunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9605.387s">She's</a> the environmental person. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9607.128s">Come</a> down and meet with us and give us an update as to what's going on, because it's obvious that our city engineer is not doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9614.591s">We've</a> asked for her to come down. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9615.952s">She</a> responds and, you know, I don't even know who to talk to around here anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9621.494s">Does</a> anybody know who's in charge? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9624.775s">Well,</a> Fidel Russo, in a few weeks, will be in charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9628.717s">Yeah?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9629.698s">Well,</a> you said it, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9631.559s">Remember,</a> loud and clear, and I agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9634.04s">That's</a> the rumor. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9634.72s">Let</a> me tell you, if that rumor comes to fruition, if that rumor comes to fruition, shame on this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9641.764s">Shame</a> on this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9643.005s">Shame</a> on this city? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9644.485s">Shame</a> on this city, because you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9646.447s">I</a> don't even know if you want the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9647.627s">I</a> don't know if you're up for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9650.128s">I</a> think you have a hard time with this job. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9651.649s">I</a> don't know what you would do as being mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9654.659s">So,</a> well, let's say, listen, why would he mix 500,000 in another job? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9661.301s">Why</a> would you want to pay for 141? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9665.482s">Well,</a> if you don't like me here, then what do you want me to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9668.143s">Don't</a> tell me what to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9669.083s">You</a> run. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9669.804s">If</a> you think it's such a great job, it's personal. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9672.504s">I'm</a> very comfortable too. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9673.645s">So</a> don't tell me what to do.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9688.586s">Meet</a> with, an update, present themselves before the Council for an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9691.347s">You</a> know something, you better enclose the Office of Community Development because they had something to do with this with Brown and Carlwell as it relates to that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9748.2s">As</a> it relates to council, um, cover yellows terminology, March of last year, they were supposed to establish a quality assurance plan made in June of last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9758.646s">They</a> were supposed to collect all the data that was needed to refine, to refine phase three. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9763.743s">July</a> and August last year, they're supposed to write the phase three plan, which would be four to six weeks out. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9768.887s">In</a> September, there was supposed to be a public comment period. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9771.108s">We</a> never had it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9772.049s">October,</a> the city was supposed to respond to the comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9774.41s">We</a> never heard anything about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9775.711s">In</a> late fall and winter final, they will have the final remediation design. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9780.234s">That's</a> what the city signed off on. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9784.878s">We</a> haven't seen any of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9786.719s">And</a> now you're telling me he's going to be digging holes and sticking liquid in there?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9807.637s">That</a> was something that was discussed but it wasn't decided upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9811.06s">You</a> can't decide on anything when you haven't had the public hearing.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=127.305s">that's</a> broken. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=129.146s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=129.487s">$150</a> million budget in the system is broken. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=133.609s">Well,</a> anyway, um, I want to welcome you all here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=136.011s">Tonight</a> is a very important night for our city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=139.513s">Um,</a> cause we have a whole host of things going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=142.816s">Um,</a> beside Mr. Sano, we're going to be talking about the arts and after that we'll be talking about a whole host of other things, but it doesn't happen very often that we have individuals who stand out <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=153.785s">within</a> our community for recognition. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=156.646s">But</a> this gentleman's recognition, I believe, was a concerted effort with all his colleagues at Andrew Remax in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=164.91s">But</a> fortunately for him, he won the standout. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=168.451s">It</a> came as a result of a—you can correct me if I'm wrong—as a combination of, I believe, 15 realtor associations throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=177.856s">But</a> he received the number one award amongst over 20,000 realtors. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=183.722s">in</a> the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=185.603s">And</a> that was predicated upon the fact that I believe he was nominated, or he was chosen as the Greater Boston Area Realtor of the Year, which put him into the direction of being the Massachusetts Greater Boston, or strike that, the Massachusetts Association Realtor of the Year. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=201.928s">It's</a> a huge honor, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=204.489s">It</a> comes to us again in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=206.589s">This</a> is the third time in less than two years <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=209.375s">that</a> we have been recognized within our community by individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=212.779s">The</a> first one was Victor Garrow, as we all know, the wonderful job he did on a legal case. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=217.344s">Last</a> year, it was Dr. Lepore on what he did on flute instruments. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=221.669s">This</a> year, it's Andrew Sano as it relates to, you know, all three different professions, but all here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=228.707s">We</a> do have a captive audience of intelligent people in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=232.571s">Unfortunately,</a> the news media just doesn't play it the same way that individuals such as myself and members of this Medford City Council on times recognize individuals for the good work and the deeds that they do within this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=245.722s">I</a> would be less than not saying this. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=249.226s">In</a> the audience is his cohorts, colleagues that you work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=253.489s">owner</a> and operator, Andrew Veneziano, and those that work with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=256.691s">And</a> I just think that just tells the whole story for the recognition that's being given here tonight, that Mr. Sano absolutely deserves what he's going to receive. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=265.095s">And</a> it's nothing more than a, just a little plaque or another plaque. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=269.878s">It's,</a> it's accommodation, but sometimes it's these little things that mean more than these big plaques and these big monstrous things that people get with their name on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=278.475s">To</a> me, it's a big thing, because I'm a councilor, and nobody in the city can do this other than a city councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=284.2s">So</a> it reads as follows, that the Medford City Council takes pleasure in making this council recommendation to Andrew Sano, Remax Andrew Realty Services, in recognition on being named the 2014 Massachusetts Realtor of the Year by the Massachusetts Association of Realtors. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=299.953s">Signed</a> by Councilor Dello Russo, President, and myself, Councilor Robert Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=303.896s">It's</a> my honor, thank you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=976.138s">When</a> we decided to go on this endeavor, we figured, <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=980.357s">How</a> do we sell this to double the budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=982.878s">And</a> I'm saying to myself, this is really not a hard sell. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=985.72s">Because</a> number one, we have $6.5 million in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=989.441s">That's</a> an awful lot of money to have in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=991.422s">And</a> all we're asking is to double $15,000 to $30,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=994.364s">So</a> $15,000 is already going to be accounted for from last year's budget to include $30,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=999.166s">But</a> I look at it in this point of view. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1000.947s">I'm</a> looking at where has Medford been as compared to where is Medford going? <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1005.87s">We</a> just gave an award here tonight to the Realtor of the Year. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1009.618s">The</a> biggest asset that we have in this community in selling real estate is to have people come to the City of Method, not because of its close proximity to Boston, for which it's a big seller, but the fact that we have a public school education that people believe in and trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1026.311s">We</a> have an arts and cultural program that is now beginning to take hold and hit another group of people in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1032.936s">And</a> lastly, and more importantly, <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1034.593s">It's</a> what your taxes are paying for. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1035.974s">This</a> is what you should be getting for your taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1038.435s">And</a> you know, when you ask for something, you probably say, how are we going to get it? <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1042.216s">Well,</a> we can pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1043.457s">This</a> is something that can be very easily paid for. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1045.798s">Now,</a> I know Councilman Marks has a whole list of organizations that are credible and worthy. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1050.74s">But</a> think about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1052.42s">Think</a> about all those organizations that he's talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1055.041s">And</a> when you list your house to sell it, or when they list it to buy it, having all those organizations as part of a selling point to be competitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1064.323s">We're</a> sitting next to sister cities of Malden, Somerville, Lexington, Winchester. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1069.028s">We</a> can't be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1069.989s">We</a> won't be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1070.729s">But</a> you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1071.75s">We</a> can be ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1072.992s">And</a> what we can offer to this community is something that no one else can offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1077.016s">And</a> that's togetherness. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1078.097s">And</a> that's making sure that this city moves forward in a cultural, in an educational, and in a direction that really is going to bring Medford tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1087.31s">Developing</a> our downtown areas, having organizations such as this, whether you go to West Medford and you have the open studios, or whether, as he said, maybe someday having a storefront that's good for the arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1097.897s">What's</a> wrong with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1099.038s">But</a> there has to be a coming together. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1101.46s">We</a> as a community now realize this is a huge change that's gonna be taking place in our community, with a new mayor coming into office. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1109.945s">But</a> not to talk about politics, but you have to talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1112.947s">And</a> this is what you should be looking at <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1115.43s">No</a> matter who the candidate might be running for this office, what's their commitment to the arts, to the culture, to the education, to the revitalization of this community, of getting itself back on the street, on a street that you're just not paying taxes for over and over again, that you're getting something for your tax dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1133.805s">And</a> that's how I'm looking at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1135.306s">I</a> think this is not only creditable, it's worthwhile. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1137.728s">You</a> know, this past, was it this past Sunday? <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1140.009s">Two</a> Sundays ago, we were at the Royal House. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1143.728s">And</a> we saw a great performance that the arts put on. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1146.85s">Something</a> that maybe a lot of people might not have an interest, but what about the people that do have an interest? <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1151.152s">They</a> don't know what it's about. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1152.233s">When</a> Councilor Longo-Curran offered that resolution to thank them for their service, you know, it was great. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1157.515s">There</a> was almost like 100 people there that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1160.057s">It</a> was a great, and it was a Sunday afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1162.798s">Where</a> would you normally see this in the past? <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1165.115s">You</a> know, whether you have Cache, whether you have Circle the Square, whether you have the Arts, whether you have the Historical Society, or whether you have all these parent-teacher groups, this is your time to galvanize and mobilize. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=1176.021s">This</a> is your time to find out who your mayor is and what that mayor should be for this community, because the time for the change is now.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3182.192s">Mr.</a> President, this is part of a triple play of recognition here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3186.654s">Mr.</a> Massachusetts, who was in his 90s, received this award most recently, and he received it by the president of France, who happened to be here, I believe, in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3196.778s">It</a> was established by Napoleon Bonaparte back in 1802, and it was given in recognition <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3201.501s">of</a> those individuals who were either in the service or they were civilians, as well as soldiers, who participated in the freedom of France. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3211.405s">This</a> is the highest decorative award that can be received, that the country of France acknowledges to individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3219.568s">And</a> it was originally given to nationals, but for non-nationals, which what Mr. Mastercuser was, is, they subsequently, the country of France subsequently recognized <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3228.843s">the</a> true value of not only our American soldiers, but all soldiers who came to their defense, especially during World War II. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3235.607s">Mr.</a> Massachusetts, as I said, he's in his 90s, and I would hope he'll be able to find some day in the future to come before the council to receive this award. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3245.492s">From</a> President Holland, H-O-L-L-A-N-D-E, from France, is the gentleman who gave us this award. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3252.476s">Now,</a> to be a chevalier is one of five degrees. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3255.538s">It's</a> like a degrees of the award, and I believe <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3258.664s">And</a> this is the highest level of the award. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3261.466s">Also,</a> Mr. President, I think it would be a great accomplishment, again, for the city of Medford to have to boast about in its downstairs office of its Veterans Affairs of another decorative American. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3274.373s">Apparently,</a> for some reason or another, this had been lying amiss, gathering some dust, so to speak, and it finally came to the forefront in the country of France. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3284.399s">And</a> Mr. Mastercut, he's a very <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3286.919s">quiet</a> individual, if anybody knows him. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3289.741s">And</a> I guess he was overtaken with so much joy and pride, for not only he and his family, but the fact that it's another Medford veteran, it's another Medford citizen who not only received this award, but the nice part about receiving this award, it came from a country, the country of France, who appreciated the fact that our American soldiers went there. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3309.014s">And</a> he's receiving this for his involvement in the invasion of Normandy, which we all know what happened in that particular invasion. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3315.981s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I would, it's a great honor to put this resolution on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3322.907s">Um,</a> and hopefully, um, the city clerk can make contact with Mr. Massachusetts and try to find a date that might be reasonable and comfortable for him to come to receive this award.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3518.984s">Mr.</a> President, this isn't an award that's part of the triple play tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3522.786s">This</a> is an award that's not given out lightly. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3526.248s">This</a> is taken on a nationwide basis as it relates to people in this particular service, ambulatory service, <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3533.512s">for</a> which they get involved in. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3535.193s">He's</a> recognized for his dedication, as we all know, for his ambulance service as a professional on the job and off the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3543.498s">And</a> this is an honor that goes to an individual as part of a thank you from the American Automobile, I mean, American, excuse me, Ambulatory Association for the service that this gentleman has done as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3555.845s">And</a> it also is to applaud individuals who set examples for people in their own profession. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3562.518s">It's</a> a way for the outside world to understand what an ambulance driver, an EMT, was all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3568.08s">It</a> goes to paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers, customer service reps, and other operators, personnel are eligible for this nomination. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3576.042s">But</a> he was single-handedly chosen out to receive this nomination for both his work in and off the field. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3581.284s">And</a> he's well respected. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3583.925s">He's</a> experienced. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3586.206s">And</a> he volunteers his time, as he has in the past, on weekends and late evenings. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3591.085s">for</a> those individuals that he works with that just can't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3595.489s">I</a> just think it would be nice to know that we have, once again, another employee here in the city, another resident of our city, who does our community proud. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3605.697s">As</a> a matter of fact, I believe in 2014, he was the representative of Cataldo Ambulance, who he's been with since 2007, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3614.504s">He</a> is the 2014 <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3620.26s">representative</a> in the Boston Marathon that he ran. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3625.144s">So</a> I know he's a very shy individual. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3630.988s">Well,</a> no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3631.789s">I</a> want him to come out next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3633.03s">So</a> Mr. Finkem have a per official citation for him and we can give it to him and maybe we can see him smile and that'll be very helpful.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3693.303s">I</a> negated to say that this Stars of Life Award is a celebration that takes place between all the ambulatory companies throughout the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3702.846s">It's</a> a national recognition. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3705.368s">So</a> this isn't local, this isn't state, this is a national recognition, which even brings more honor and more distinction. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3712.374s">And</a> I don't think he could have no more too proud of parents than his mother and father, who are very proud of the situation, having a son such as Ricky bring them honor and a great show of, how can you say, encouragement to the city of Medford, letting people know that we do have so many good people <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3731.603s">who</a> receive so many honors for the work that they do that you just never hear about. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3736.306s">So</a> with that being said, looking forward to seeing you, Ricky, next week sometime.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3798.955s">Mr.</a> President, today I spoke to our city clerk as it relates to the letter that was sent. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3805.139s">Well,</a> a copy was sent to you as well as other department heads as well as the mayor on February 24th. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3812.1s">At</a> that meeting that we had subsequent to the 24th, I believe the city clerk made a phone call on the number that was addressed in the letter to secure information as to when they would come, or if they would come, let's put it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3826.51s">And</a> I believe in my conversation with the clerk today, he said he had not heard back, but he had made contact with them, and they were aware of what we were looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3834.676s">He</a> made a phone call today, and he's waiting for them to get back to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3839.139s">Would</a> that be reasonable enough to say? <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3848.92s">The</a> letter of information that was sent to us was on February 24th, and I don't know how much longer it's going to take, to be honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3856.306s">The</a> bids were solicited on February 18th of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3859.348s">Massachusetts</a> Department of Transportation Highway Division is currently in the process of certifying the lowest bidder. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3864.532s">I</a> don't know how long it takes from February 18th to March 18th to April 18th, almost up to May 18th. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3871.304s">Maybe</a> government moves slow, but that's probably the slowest I've ever seen it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3875.465s">There's</a> a whole host of questions and issues here, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3878.546s">As</a> you said, you don't remember receiving this, and that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3881.587s">But</a> our mayor did receive it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3884.107s">Our</a> three state representatives did receive it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3887.148s">Our</a> acting building commissioner received it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3889.889s">Our</a> city engineer received it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3892.21s">But</a> the one person that didn't receive it was the Office of Community Development, who was a direct part in all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3896.871s">And</a> I don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3898.429s">how</a> that office was negated from being on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3901.792s">And</a> I don't understand what the mayor's problem and not responding back as to what might be going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3906.435s">This</a> Craddock Bridge is an integral part as to what's happening in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3910.739s">And</a> the fact of the matter is that we've been talking about this thing, I think, dating back to 2007, if I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3916.784s">I</a> think the very first resolution on the Craddock Bridge is owned by Councilor Lungo-Koehn going back to 2004 regarding the safety of the bridge on a question that was brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3927.322s">And</a> she then forwarded that to the council as part of a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3930.323s">And</a> subsequent to that, it's been resolution after resolution and after resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3933.925s">And</a> if this bridge was in such terrible disrepair, and if it was sinking and afraid to come apart and crumbling, we wouldn't even be talking about this right now, because it would be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3943.509s">We're</a> not asking for a $13 million bridge that the state wants to put together. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3947.571s">It's</a> sitting on solid granite that's been there in excess of 100 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3951.132s">We're</a> just looking for a bridge that can handle traversing traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3954.954s">That's</a> all. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3955.414s">We're</a> not looking for a state of the art, <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3957.612s">mausoleum</a> type of a bridge that we can say, oh, wow. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3960.795s">And</a> that's how the state gets itself in trouble, especially with spending its money without looking at the simple characteristic of putting a bridge, putting a roadway back together to let the cars go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3971.663s">And</a> if the locks have a problem that need to be resolved, then address it as a separate issue or a joint issue at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3977.628s">But</a> to have this thing go out that started off as a $2.5 million, then it went up to $14 million, now it's back to $11 million, then it goes up to $12 million, <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3986.492s">Even</a> they don't even know what's going on in the state, because we don't even know what the state is going to cost in real time when they begin to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=3994.595s">And</a> then when they're talking about it's going to be done within 1,300 calendar days from the receipt of the notice to proceed, well, that's an awful lot of time, 1,300 calendar days. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4003.497s">And</a> even if you split that in half, because they work double time or whatever it might be, that's over 650 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4009.319s">I</a> mean, there's got to be an explanation that's better. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4014.08s">They</a> could do fast 14. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4016.425s">in</a> 12 weekends during the course of a summer, then they could make a bridge that could be working for the Craddock Bridge, build it ahead of time, and come in maybe in a week's period of time or in a couple weeks to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4030.451s">You</a> know, I'm just disappointed in our city engineer not even responding back to us on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4037.514s">I'm</a> also disappointed the Office of Community Development, knowing now that they were excluded from it, has not stuck their two cents in there to find out why were they excluded. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4046.73s">And</a> deeply disappointed because the mayor, he doesn't respond to anything with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4049.931s">So</a> that's a given. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4051.431s">This</a> whole issue has been predicated on the council's involvement on this particular matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4056.552s">We're</a> looking for mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4057.772s">We</a> have absolutely no concern from anybody as it relates to this issue of mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4063.333s">If</a> the mayor was the mayor, he'd be out there fighting tooth and nail that before this bid goes out, there'd be some form of mitigation for any sense of disruption that may takes place here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4075.673s">I</a> don't know where we're going, Mr. President, but all I can tell you is this, and I'm not looking into a crystal ball, but maybe I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4083.436s">If</a> the mayor leaves before this term is over and you assume the position of mayor of this city, because that's what the charter says, then I would expect you to have a decision before this council immediately as to time, date, place, and mitigation of this bridge, because you've been just as much a part of this as anyone else has been. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4104.324s">You've</a> been aware of this just as much as anyone else has been. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4107.827s">And</a> if you do the same thing that the guy in the corner office has done by not communicating, then the shame is going to be on you. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4114.694s">And</a> I would hope that that does not rest on your shoulders, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4194.684s">Can</a> I ask you a question?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4196.565s">Yes,</a> the question is, when did you find out about this?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4201.349s">Yesterday,</a> and you're bringing it to the council tonight, and you expect me by 10 o'clock tomorrow morning, for which I already have another engagement, to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4208.755s">I</a> mean, why didn't Mr. Stedman just call the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4211.077s">Why</a> didn't he call the clerk? <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4212.118s">He</a> had been speaking to the clerk.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4222.09s">The</a> President Well, I didn't make my comment facetiously about you becoming the mayor, because the word is out that the mayor is leaving before his term expires, whether it's rumor or what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4234.013s">So</a> I'm just telling you right up front, on any of these big issues, Mr. President, if, in fact, you do become the mayor of this community under the charter, I would hope a lot of these issues — a lot of these issues that are out there — <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4246.023s">you</a> will address in a much better fashion than he.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4305.069s">You</a> can go as my, you can go as my representative.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4318.915s">I</a> don't think any person, even a citizen would be out of place.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4332.02s">No,</a> no, no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4332.721s">I</a> want to keep this open. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4333.781s">I</a> want to know where we're going with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4334.921s">So</a> I'd like to lay this on the table until we find out further information on motion to table by Council Penta.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4541.514s">No</a> letter, Speaker.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4589.574s">50%,</a> 50-50, 50 for police and fire, 50 for education.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4596.379s">Not</a> a station.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4608.363s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4612.147s">I</a> think what Mr. Vigliano presents is a reasonable proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4617.751s">Also,</a> what I heard tonight was kind of like reasonable as well, too, when they talked about the library and I think councilor Caraviello was probably on mark with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4625.803s">There</a> are two pretty central locations here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4629.426s">The</a> one interesting part about the library, if I remember correctly, this is history, and going back, I believe the building can withstand the addition of a top floor to the building, or there's a section in the building that you could go up and add another section to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4643.877s">But</a> the availability of Shavire Auditorium being right there and satelliting with another location for the purposes of transmission and studios and everything else like that, <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4655.519s">It</a> presents a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4657.0s">And</a> I like the idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4657.86s">I</a> never even thought of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4658.82s">I</a> shouldn't have thought of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4660.361s">I</a> wasn't even thinking of the air conditioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4663.261s">One</a> agency or one division can loan the other people to a division to get the money for whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4668.423s">Representative</a> Donato has been very successful in Beacon Hill in getting money for the chairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4672.484s">And</a> maybe he can get some success in getting money for the air conditioning for the building or for a partial air conditioning for the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4679.446s">But</a> the sad part to all of this whole story <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4682.031s">It's</a> going to take place tomorrow at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, because we have what they call an ascertainment hearing at 2 o'clock tomorrow afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4690.813s">Excuse</a> me, Thursday afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4692.133s">Excuse</a> me, Thursday afternoon at 2 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4695.074s">And</a> the sad part about having this ascertainment hearing on Thursday at 2 o'clock is the contract with Comcast has already come to an end. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4701.575s">So</a> technically, we're actually working with them as a tenant at will. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4705.416s">This</a> ascertainment hearing should have taken place at minimum six months to a year prior to the contract closing. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4711.715s">So</a> what's going to be accomplished at this hearing is not going to make any sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4716.478s">But</a> the only sense that it will make is for people to come and tell them why you don't like what you're getting, whether the folks at Comcast are rude or they're not rude, whether the fees are too high, whether the channels should be a la carte or individual, or whether the programming should have a whole different type of an appetite, and to show what comparisons might be between Verizon and Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4737.949s">As</a> a matter of fact, Comcast has been voted <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4740.528s">the</a> worst corporation in the country for customer services on the national agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4749.356s">And</a> our mayor was one of 52 who wrote letters to the Federal Trade Commission for the purposes of allowing Comcast to be bought into this merger with Time Warner, thankfully that they did not allow because they felt that the corporate conglomerate would just destroy this whole idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4766.705s">not</a> only of public access, but for televising, what do you call it, bandwidth and broadband. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4773.47s">So</a> these are all technical things that are beyond my imagination for understanding, but all I know is having an understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4779.955s">But</a> when they turn around and put a picture of our present mayor on a story with other mayors saying that he was a shill for Comcast, and he was a shill, and they went down to explain <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4791.17s">that</a> the reason is because on an annual basis, got $10,000 a year for a celebration committee, got $2,500 each and every year for his golf tournament. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4801.2s">And</a> when you start thinking about that and you hear people talk about it, they're saying, wait a minute, we're not paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4806.626s">I'm</a> not paying my cable bill so he can have a golf tournament every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4810.069s">I'm</a> not paying my cable bill so he can have a celebration committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4813.887s">And</a> that's a cost that's built right in to everyone's cable fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4817.189s">Comcast</a> isn't giving this for nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4819.169s">They</a> know what the cost is to give out those perks to those 52 mayors who signed on and were termed shills for Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4827.393s">That's</a> a hell of a way to go out of office, being known that you were shill, leaving the city all upside down with these crazy meters in the square, and God knows what else is going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4836.677s">The</a> fact of the matter is, <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4838.164s">We</a> have a terrible contract here with Comcast, and nothing should be signed until a new mayor comes on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4845.21s">So</a> if we have to stay on as nothing more than a tenant, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4849.413s">I'm</a> going to ask that this council make a request that the mayor does not sign any new 10-year contract with Comcast and until a new administration comes on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4860.221s">Isn't</a> it interesting? <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4861.404s">They</a> took the same thing when they were trying to hire a new public works director. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4865.367s">They</a> went through the whole process, and then they decided to stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4868.05s">Let</a> the new mayor come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4869.371s">Let</a> the new mayor hire that person. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4871.313s">Well,</a> we have enough 10-year contracts to deal with. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4873.915s">We</a> have a rubbish contract that I believe was in its seventh year, and it was re-upped for another 10 years when they renewed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4881.241s">We</a> have a stupid kiosk program that's a 10-year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4885.405s">And</a> we have a contract right now that's not in operation, <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4888.063s">which</a> is the tail end of a Comcast contract, which is all over, it's expired. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4892.607s">So</a> if we have to sit around and being tenants at will, so be it, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4896.59s">But</a> I don't think the mayor should do anything, anything, to indulge this community into another 10-year contract without having a say, and especially not having a public hearing in advance before any contract negotiation took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4910.32s">So</a> I move that resolution, Mr. President, that the Medford City Council go on record and respectfully request the mayor <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4916.712s">not</a> to engage and not to sign any contract with Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4921.693s">Until</a> there's a new mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4925.615s">Until</a> a new mayor is sworn in.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4975.035s">The</a> difference between this paper and that one, we now are dealing with a contract that's expired. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4978.918s">Number</a> one, we're dealing with the national attainment hearing that's taking place this Thursday that should have come before the fact, and it's now coming after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4986.082s">What</a> the mayor intends to accomplish by doing this, and it was this council that voted 7 to 11 to have that hearing take place at 6, 630 at night to allow taxpayers who couldn't have an opportunity to come at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=4997.589s">We're</a> now dealing with a contract that's already been—that's expired. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5000.852s">You</a> are talking about a contract that was still in operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5003.613s">Now,</a> with no contract, <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5004.997s">and</a> having no direction from the mayor, this is a respectful request that he does not sign any contract with Comcast until on and after a new mayor has been sworn in.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5057.59s">Well,</a> point of further information, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5061.871s">Council</a> Knight just included a resolve that was passed earlier this year, which I'm assuming he voted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5067.312s">And</a> now he's trying to say, what right do we have to interfere? <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5069.992s">Well,</a> the mayor has already acknowledged it by noting that he's not going to hire a new Department of Public Works director at $120,000 plus a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5077.413s">And</a> he's letting that go. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5078.654s">He's</a> already set the channels in one particular direction on an appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5083.735s">Did</a> the council receive a paper to that effect? <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5086.294s">Pardon</a> me? <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5086.694s">Did</a> the Council receive a paper to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5088.315s">I</a> think if you speak to the, um, um, um, what's her name downstairs? <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5093.739s">I</a> can't think of her name. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5094.84s">Mrs.</a> Miller. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5095.4s">She'll</a> tell you that that's what the city has done.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5137.357s">I</a> think if you heard my question, it was respectfully request. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5139.898s">That</a> was the term.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5142.199s">Would</a> the clerk please read back the language?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5531.351s">The</a> idea of having the ascertainment hearing, if it was done ahead of time, would have presented the fact that, under the way the city of Medfords has been operating, the issuing authority has been the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5541.258s">But</a> if the ascertainment hearing showed enough interest that the issuing authority be the legislative body, the council, OK, that would be the time for the purposes of the renegotiation. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5550.886s">That's</a> the whole idea of having that type of a hearing well in advance, not after the fact, because the cat's already out of the bag.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5562.748s">I</a> just think it's unfair because we had asked respectfully that the meeting take place at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5566.83s">So</a> residents who had a complaint could, or even a compliment could have come and had an opportunity to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5571.412s">But</a> now who's going to come at two in the afternoon?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5620.284s">We're</a> not renewing something before the deadline. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5622.245s">The</a> deadline has now come and gone, so there is no contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5625.787s">There</a> is no renewal. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5627.147s">This</a> is like writing a brand new contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5629.488s">There's</a> no grace period in here.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5755.204s">No,</a> I'm not talking about three and that's not my resolution.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5772.929s">No,</a> I think the contract is simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5775.291s">If</a> the contract has already expired as of April 20th, there is no contract.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5789.09s">can</a> you just read read the resolution before you get to the amendments and then we'll just take them when I'm you're getting me confused with all these what's the resolution say started off the main opinion from the city solicitor on their
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5808.837s">That</a> would be a separate resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5810.539s">That</a> was an amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5812.44s">That's</a> the amendment, it's not the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5814.082s">Can</a> you read the resolution before it's amended? <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5817.424s">That</a> the mayor respectfully request the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5819.906s">That's</a> an amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5821.267s">No,</a> that's the resolution.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5849.296s">And</a> then it's amended with the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5852.538s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5853.138s">Roll</a> call.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=5861.335s">and</a> the connectivity.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6814.769s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks, for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6816.709s">I</a> brought this up a few weeks ago on two separate occasions relative to cars being swinged over there, but it's a result of the 16 cars that were allowed to park <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6828.748s">on</a> the corner of Winthrop Street and Playstead Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6832.23s">And</a> right now, you're lucky if there's one car there a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6835.151s">So</a> take the average of 15 cars a day not being there at $5 a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6839.934s">That's</a> $75 a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6841.735s">Once</a> a month is $300, times 12 is $3,600 a year that they're not getting that they anticipated. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6849.199s">And</a> by pushing these cars onto the side streets over there, you're just going to compound. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6853.401s">You're</a> going to create another problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6855.199s">that</a> the resident parking, that these cars that are not capable of doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6859.96s">I</a> have a letter, which I'll bring next week, from a resident who tells me on four particular occasions how she had to go out and help people, not only negotiate the meter, but the glare. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6871.322s">Going</a> right back to what you said, Rick, the glare of the meter, you can't see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6875.142s">It's</a> unreadable. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6878.263s">Who</a> put money in the meter did not get the right receipt that came back. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6881.563s">One</a> got a receipt, two people later, <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6885.142s">Another</a> one put the money in the meter, got four quarters back for his quarter. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6888.564s">It's</a> a stupid system. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6890.245s">And</a> it's the stupidest thing that this mayor could have ever come up with. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6894.188s">He</a> could resolve his whole legacy if he just comes forward and says, listen, we made a mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6898.331s">We're</a> going to get rid of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6899.411s">And</a> we're going to go revert ourselves back to a local, as Councilor Marks alluded to, a revenue traffic enforcement program. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6905.676s">And</a> we'll do it in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6906.896s">And</a> we'll start slow. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6907.997s">And</a> we'll move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6909.358s">This</a> thing is not helping anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6911.359s">You</a> can go to the business. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6912.56s">The</a> business merchants will tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6914.285s">It</a> is not helping us. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6915.666s">As</a> a matter of fact, it's so unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6917.386s">You</a> go to West Medford, they still have a meter in front of a residential home, but people are still trying to put it in, and they're not supposed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6923.268s">That</a> meter should have been taken out of there months ago, and it's still there. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6926.71s">How</a> do you put a meter in front of a dentist, a one-dentist-person office on High Street, and the other one in front of a — in front of a what? <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6935.533s">We'd</a> call it a funeral home, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6937.034s">I</a> mean, it's unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6938.054s">It's</a> just — it just doesn't make any sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6940.695s">It's</a> a killer to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6941.875s">It's</a> anti-business. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6943.647s">It's</a> anti-citizen. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6944.887s">It's</a> just anti-everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6947.548s">Medford</a> is not downtown Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6949.309s">It</a> is not these places. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6951.449s">And</a> as Councilor Mark's resolution points out, it's forcing people to go to other parts of the community to park their cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6958.931s">And</a> you're going to start to see people really getting pedoed with people parking in front of their houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6963.893s">And</a> you're going to see some damage done to these cars, because people, you know, someone turned around and sold something. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6968.914s">You</a> can't tell me where to park. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6969.994s">I</a> can go to the public street, and I can park here. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6971.675s">And</a> this is the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6973.627s">So</a> this issue was really compounded and multiplied itself and it needs to be resolved immediately before something happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6980.532s">Something</a> personal happens to the property and something personal happens to someone. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6984.515s">If</a> physical altercations take place because of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6987.297s">So</a> I thank you for putting that forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/AaQ8aBCh_2k&t=6988.678s">And</a> I would ask Mr. President, Councilor Marks, I would ask that you forward, you want a response from the chief of police on this immediately, immediately on this matter.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_V22AEle-x6o/2025-03-21_V22AEle-x6o.html">Medford City Council - April 28, 2015</a></h2>

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2403.277s">So</a> since we are eligible, are we going to be taxed at any point in time from another community development plan because you're part of this consortium?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2414.403s">Are</a> we going to have to give up some monies that benefit the plan and another community?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2450.538s">Second</a> question is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2453.595s">This</a> idea of giving the housing authority $15,000, of all the people that have applied, they are sitting on hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2462.903s">Why</a> would you be doing that? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2464.004s">I</a> mean, I'm not worried about trying to develop a relationship with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2467.968s">They</a> never even got back to us after the feds went in there and did an in-depth investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2472.431s">And</a> we were supposed to get a report back as to whether they were or were not adhering to the rules and regulations of not only federal practices, but also accounting practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2481.415s">for</a> which, again, we have yet to receive anything back. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2484.437s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2485.178s">But</a> why would you give money to someone who sits on hundreds and thousands of dollars of revenue that they receive both from federal and state when you have so many other small little agencies who are trying to work their butts off to offer services in a myriad of ways within this community? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2502.951s">I</a> can't buy that. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2504.192s">I'm</a> sorry.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2556.684s">Well,</a> maybe they should transfer the monies that they just approved for parks and recreation and for new courts in the same area and use it for the air conditioning and make that the priority.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2591.167s">Lauren,</a> you may say it's a small amount of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2593.609s">It's</a> $15,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2594.61s">That's</a> not a small amount when you're taking less than $1,000 away from other benefactors who are looking for the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2600.475s">Mr.</a> Clark. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2601.228s">I'm</a> going to move to eliminate the $15,000 from the house from this budget for the housing authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2606.67s">Also,</a> you, you talked about planning and administration for $286,000 in that $286,000 there is a comment that says whenever possible, the city will make every effort to attract discretionary and formula grant funds from federal and state sources to meet community development objectives. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2630.388s">Now,</a> if I understand that correctly, that's telling me that either A, you're going to hire somebody, or B, you're going to hire a consultant who has the ability to go out there and get additional monies, either through a grant or through some type of discretionary fund for me.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2650.682s">So</a> why the wording is in there is- Well, maybe the next mayor coming in will take a look at all of this and understand that a two-person office can't do this, and I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2659.416s">But</a> I'm more concerned over if this is what the objective is to hire someone.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2674.044s">And</a> that's what's not in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2675.105s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2675.345s">That's</a> what's not described here as part of the 286.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2711.31s">Mr.</a> Clark, you who Mr. Clark, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2717.196s">Is</a> he paying attention or not? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2718.797s">Mr.</a> Clark, the council has a question, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2725.722s">If</a> you ran the meeting like you're supposed to, I'd like to put an addendum on there that we get a complete breakdown of the $286,754 for the purposes of any and all salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2738.367s">Well,</a> it's more than that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2741.328s">Any</a> consultant that has to- No, I'm talking about employee salaries in this building.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2752.253s">I</a> said any part of the $286,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2753.373s">That</a> goes towards salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2755.234s">That</a> goes towards salaries by name and by title.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2760.156s">And</a> the office of security development. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2761.256s">Do</a> you have that? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2764.678s">Who?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2767.219s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2768.093s">No,</a> I'm talking to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2771.554s">Mr.</a> Clerk, did you understand that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2778.956s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3122.706s">I</a> just... They've never been refused money by the state, have they?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3126.926s">They've</a> gotten money each and every year for their state projects.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3290.032s">Why</a> are we spending money into a center that was already rehabbed before when you're leaving the 124 units still without air conditioning? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3300.92s">I</a> think they need to answer that question.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3328.213s">So</a> then maybe they are, if you looked at the minutes of their last meeting, you can look at the parks and the developments that they're doing on the outsides of pieces of the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3336.096s">If</a> I was a senior citizen and I was living there, and I haven't had air conditioning for all these years, and I all of a sudden <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3341.638s">your</a> air conditioning and community center that I don't sleep in at night time because I'm going to have to go and during the course, I'm not going to spend all day in the community center. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3349.986s">Maybe</a> they should be putting a program together to show how they're going to air condition those units that the people live in day in and day out. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3357.353s">They</a> give them heat in the winter time, we'll give them air conditioning in the summer.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3370.658s">Maybe</a> they should come before us, Lauren, before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3374.04s">I'm</a> going to stick to my issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3376.921s">If</a> you want to lay it on the table for a week, let the council go over it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3380.243s">No,</a> I mean, let the council go over it, subject to whether they get the money in on the issue.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3459.952s">That's</a> a point of further information, clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3462.853s">When</a> the dedication took place at the Fond du Carreau Center, the place was air conditioned at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3467.135s">So</a> what happened to the air condition from then until now? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3469.476s">Yeah,</a> I think the heat pump, is that what they call it, the heat pump? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3471.857s">I</a> have no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3473.368s">But</a> they should have been better prepared when they made their presentation before the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3476.47s">Councilor</a> Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3477.511s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3637.074s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3638.315s">Warren,</a> you made the comment that we could vote to take it out and always put it back in. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3643.437s">Correct?</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3664.304s">And</a> I don't think it's a matter of waiting in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3666.125s">I</a> think your assistant there just got through saying that, you know, you're probably getting $50,000 more from the state this year.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3679.549s">See,</a> that's the whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3680.35s">When</a> they came before us that night at that meeting, they were so ill prepared. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3684.17s">to</a> talk about where they were going with the projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3686.732s">They</a> just wanted our money. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3687.873s">They</a> just wanted the community block grant money. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3690.115s">They're</a> sitting on hundreds of thousands of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3692.137s">They</a> have grant writers over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3693.558s">They</a> have specialists that could do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3695.639s">And</a> to take the money from other deserving projects here in the city, I think it's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3699.963s">That's</a> my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3700.664s">I</a> hear you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3742.487s">Laura,</a> let's go back and ask the question again. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3744.488s">If</a> in fact we go back to this $50,000 number at that point in time, could you pull this money?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3835.584s">All</a> we're doing is securing information, Paul. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3837.186s">We're</a> not asking you to take the money out. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3839.168s">All</a> she's going to do is report back if they're getting the money, and if they are getting the money, whatever the council so chooses.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3848.917s">Why</a> would you not want to get information?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3879.077s">That</a> becomes the whole issue, Paul. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3880.598s">So</a> let's give them as much money as we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3882.679s">That</a> becomes the whole issue, because all they're going to be doing is keep putting Band-Aids and Band-Aids and Band-Aids. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3886.8s">They</a> need a complete rehabilitation down there.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3940.782s">But</a> I think one of the issues, you're talking about the Green Line. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3943.843s">That's</a> not a definitive thing, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3945.403s">Number</a> two, that's not even looked upon by the president administration to spend another $150 million.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3954.407s">Talking</a> about the State House administration, that's where the money is going to be coming from if the Green Line extension is going to come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3961.834s">So</a> you're going from the post office in South Medford all the way to Route 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3965.999s">That's</a> not a done deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3966.94s">Then</a> you have the area metropolitan area planning council.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3975.565s">The</a> Tufts University, Tufts University, Tufts University.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3979.447s">So</a> you take that. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3980.708s">I</a> believe there's also a report, Lauren, that came back from the metropolitan area planning council that has itself supposedly at the end of route 16 for 165 units of affordable and low income housing for which the public hearing on that particular night that took place in room 207, there were many, many residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3997.587s">from</a> the West Method area that were very upset about that because of the traffic, the congestion, the cars that would be parking there. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4003.011s">So</a> there's a multitude of issues that are going on with this whole idea of the screen line extension. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4007.374s">I'm</a> more concerned about your housing authority, the housing, not yours, the housing authority that has not come forward with any type of a game plan for that walkway court. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4015.821s">And</a> all I see is patchwork, patchwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4017.735s">patchwork</a> and I think it's totally unfair.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=5019.749s">A</a> quick question, John. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=5022.15s">You</a> had indicated some time back that the City of Lynn, I believe, fronts shows with money and the shows produce the money back.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=5031.997s">To</a> the community.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=5107.678s">So</a> how could you make your argument successful for the city administration to front the money up front to get repaid back? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=5115.622s">And</a> there might be some losses in the beginning, like you said, until it gets to the point that it's repaid.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=5191.342s">We're</a> not really losing. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=5192.183s">We</a> can win in the long run.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=5228.69s">You</a> know, real quick, you just mentioned the Stoneham theater and you know yourself, they were struggling in the beginning to get themselves going. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=5234.553s">And</a> it was the type of shows that they brought in that's basically saved them. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=5238.215s">And</a> now they're, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=5239.258s">They're</a> for profit.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7298.489s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7299.599s">Mr.</a> President, this is a very important position. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7301.76s">As</a> we all know, this will be the first time in so many, many years that this office is going to be vacated by the incumbent mayor, Michael McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7311.507s">As</a> I said before, I wish him well for whatever endeavor he so chooses. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7315.509s">And</a> I would hope that he would be finishing out his term and not leaving ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7320.172s">But</a> be that as it may, that's not the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7323.334s">Right</a> now, the second highest position in this building, which is the Director of Budget and Personnel, has made an announcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7329.895s">that</a> that individual is going to run and seek the office of mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7333.336s">I</a> believe that was done some seven days, six days after the mayor made his announcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7338.597s">And</a> I believe that was on April 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7341.658s">And</a> as a result of that, a further announcement has been forthcoming as it relates to that individual now going to relinquish that position on May 15th. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7354.881s">And</a> today, I believe we received another press release, which was dated April 21st. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7359.912s">as</a> it relates to the fact that the Director of Budget and Personnel is going to be leaving effective May 15th, even though the announcement was made on April 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7370.797s">In</a> the second comment of the letter that states, I would not want the Office of Mayor to encounter any appearance of any conflict of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7377.921s">And</a> I think there is a, a, a miss there. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7379.722s">It's</a> not the Office of Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7380.982s">I</a> think it would be the Office of the Budget Director because unfortunately, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7385.373s">This</a> individual is the one that presents the budget to the city council and goes through all the finances to make the city's council's budget come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7393.776s">At</a> the same time, it's also the person that's in charge of personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7399.097s">There's</a> only been one person that I've been able to find in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the person comes from the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7406.3s">And</a> when this person, many, many years ago, made his announcement that he was running for attorney general, he resigned his position as vice chairman <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7415.098s">of</a> the Ways and Means Committee of the State House, that was George L. Sacco, former representative George Sacco. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7421.241s">And</a> that always stuck out in my mind when somebody running for jobs of such high authority, if you're going to be that committed to it, they relinquish their position, at-present position. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7431.946s">In</a> that time, vice chairman of Ways and Means was a very important position. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7436.269s">But</a> when he resigned that position, that was the day he made his announcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7439.85s">And</a> I would personally believe, and I would think, and I would hope, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7443.782s">that</a> a budget director would reconsider her position and resign immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7449.446s">To</a> have the luxury of reviewing a budget right now ahead of time or getting prepared for it, and I believe that the new person taking the budget director's place is now the procurement officer, and she will be assuming the budget director's position effective three days after May 15th, I think the conflict of interest is sort of like outstanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7470.02s">That's</a> an undue advantage ahead of time of any other candidate that might be running <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7473.938s">for</a> that position, and in all fairness to all parties concerned, I think May 15th doesn't serve any purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7479.903s">I</a> think it needs to be done immediately in all fairness, because if in fact, if in fact, that person were to become elected mayor of the community, and that person would be working with a mayor, I would strike that, would be working with a budget in advance that no one else would have had that advantage, advantage point two. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7496.175s">So</a> with that being said, with all due respect, I understand the position she's in. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7500.806s">I</a> understand that she's the budget director, and also the budget director in charge of personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7505.348s">And</a> if I'm looking at the second press release that was offered here today, it says that the procurement officer will only assume the position of a budget director, but not of personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7515.912s">So</a> I guess there'll be an addendum. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7518.433s">Someone</a> is going to pick up that position in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7521.274s">So</a> with that being said, I would like that position to be made loud and clear, and all fairness to all candidates, whoever they may be, he or she, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7529.632s">that</a> if the second highest position in this city has that authority for which that person has in here, I think in all fairness, they should be resigning immediately, not till May 15th, to get their ducks in order, just in case that person does, in fact, become the mayor of this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7548.142s">And</a> you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7549.043s">I've</a> spoken to members up in the State House, and they have basically said the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7555.066s">Judge</a> Sacco set the precedent. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7557.205s">of</a> resigning his position when he decided to run for Attorney General, because that's how committed he was. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7562.53s">He</a> was willing to give up that for which he had to go forward and campaign for that position of Attorney General. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7568.115s">And</a> that's what stuck out in my mind all these years. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7571.057s">And</a> then when I saw the situation taking place here right now, and reading today's press release, I just thought that that would probably be the fair way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7579.225s">And</a> fairness to the person herself, to just leave <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7584.337s">and</a> move forward because you've already committed to a date. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7586.539s">Why</a> did you commit on May 15th? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7588.0s">I</a> don't know if it's to get the budget in order and hands it down to the next president. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7593.344s">Again,</a> totally unfair and big advantage and a big conflict as far as I'm concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7599.469s">Councilor</a> Camuso.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7649.353s">Yes,</a> in response to Councilor Camuso, I didn't challenge her integrity and I didn't challenge her high caliber. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7655.538s">What</a> I'm saying is the potentiality of a conflict of interest existing. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7660.381s">I</a> have, I hear what you're saying and I don't disagree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7664.845s">But</a> I'm more concerned about the appearance of a conflict. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7668.088s">Second</a> highest position in this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7670.63s">That's</a> how I'm looking at it right now.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7858.052s">Councilor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7859.994s">Mr.</a> President and anyone who might be watching, but more importantly, business people in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7864.945s">that</a> have to abide by the rules and regulations set forth by the council, the billing department, and the liquor commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7872.148s">I</a> observed something that's written in the local news food blog issue he made on March 16th, 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7879.291s">It</a> says snappy patties will get a whole lot bigger with the new patio. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7885.914s">And</a> then it goes on to say that snappy patties in West Method is going to expand with 50 more seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7893.202s">And</a> they're going to put an outside, upscale, contemporary American food of world influence, which they'll be putting outside for a service. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7903.385s">And</a> they're going to more than double their capacity with the addition of a 50-plus seat capacity, including an outside bar, according to the job postings for positions on Craigslist. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7916.209s">Now,</a> the unfortunate part about this, I think both for Councilor Caraviello and myself, on two separate occasions, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7922.919s">weeks</a> apart from each other, were informed that Snappy Patty's was serving alcohol, not beer and wine. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7929.503s">And</a> such reports were submitted to the Liquor Commission and for which on both times, the Liquor Commission had to tell the Snappy Patty people they couldn't do that because they wouldn't be in jeopardy of their liquor license. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7941.71s">Well,</a> after the first occasion, they should have been fined because they knew that they wouldn't, they shouldn't be doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7946.833s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7948.145s">I</a> believe last week at some point in time, they were out there in the backyard with the backhoe or whatever, digging up the backyard. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7956.669s">That</a> in and of itself prompted the building department to go down there and tell them that they had to stop, whether cease and desist, or they were going to be fined. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7966.094s">They</a> continuously are just being obstinate to the rules and regulations as to what's going on in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7973.357s">There</a> are many businesses here in this community <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7977.08s">that</a> abide by the liquor license laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7979.261s">As</a> a matter of fact, I think most recently during, I would say early December or thereabouts, there were, I think, eight restaurants in this community that the Liquor Commission went in to make sure that the folks were doing what they were supposed to be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7991.024s">And</a> I think two of them unfortunately got warnings because of the serving of the alcohol. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7996.105s">And</a> I believe in those situations, they were to minors. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7999.326s">But</a> this one here, they brazenly are serving hard alcohol beverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8005.034s">at</a> Snappy Patty's in total violation and total violation of the liquor laws here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8011.559s">Now,</a> if we all remember, we had a discussion most recently regarding Bertucci's wanting to expand and go with an outside dining capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8020.887s">And</a> by doing that, I believe they gave us a demonstration and they gave us a schematic of the tables that were going to be in the restaurant needing to be at least two to three feet apart to allow a wheelchair to get by and also <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8033.31s">to</a> have the accessibility of a handicapped bathroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8036.972s">I</a> strongly suggest that now Snappy Patty's has put themselves into a spotlight. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8041.774s">I</a> think their present location needs to be looked at as it relates to, is there room wide enough for a wheelchair to make an accessibility way in and out of their floor arrangement to a handicapped bathroom? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8054.94s">And</a> at the same time, this sole proposal for this expansion of 50 plus seats <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8061.171s">which</a> I think takes into question, is it even going to go on city property? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8065.213s">And</a> if it is going to go on city property, for which we all know we're still waiting for the results, for the report to come back on the contamination of that particular parking lot that's back there. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8076.279s">So</a> I'm going to ask, Madam President, that the building commissioner report, well, they gave us an initial report here tonight, that they put things down for which Snappy Patty's needs to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8087.785s">I</a> believe what they need to do is first, before they do anything, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8090.888s">They</a> have to commit construction documents to the building department. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8095.472s">They</a> haven't done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8096.653s">They</a> have to apply for a building permit, for which they haven't done. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8099.615s">They</a> have to send in a certified plot plan, for which they haven't done. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8102.938s">They</a> have to submit a floor plan showing the detailed description of the proposed work area, for which they haven't done. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8108.703s">And</a> they haven't applied before the council for an outside permit to have their business. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8113.547s">So</a> how does this business take it upon themselves to go forward, start construction, start digging up, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8120.289s">advertise</a> what they're going to do in total violation of the rules and regulations of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8125.95s">If</a> that's the case, Mr. President, and they continue to go forward, and they don't submit the appropriate paperwork and do what they're supposed to do, then I think the council needs to—and if I—Mr. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8134.112s">Clerk,</a> you can correct me if I'm wrong—do they have a common vigilance license from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8139.653s">They</a> do. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8140.313s">I</a> think the council should have a show cause hearing on their common vigilance license for a violation of how they're operating, and at the same time, the request would go to the Liquor Commission <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8150.275s">as</a> it relates to their violation of the liquor laws of the city of Medford, and it's quite obvious now, dated April 28th, that the building department is well aware of what they're doing and what needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8161.458s">You</a> know, this is absolutely unfair to every other single business person that's had to come into this community to go by the rules and regulations as outlined by the building department and by this council, if in fact they have to come before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8175.401s">But</a> to let this one particular business just do what they want to do <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8179.318s">advertise</a> what they want to do, don't have the right proper documentation, that's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8186.303s">So,</a> Madam President, I'm referring this both back to the building department, to our liquor commission, and to our council waiting for a report back as to what they're going to do resulting from the building commission sending them their notices that they're violating without proper authority.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8441.695s">I</a> forgot. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8442.075s">I</a> mean, and the Craig list announced, uh, it basically says, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8446.059s">They're</a> doubling their capacity with an addition of a 50 foot seating capacity, including an outside bar. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8452.48s">I</a> mean an outside bar. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8455.021s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8455.461s">So</a> put that all together. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8457.761s">And</a> how do you advertise like that on, on March?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8463.122s">March</a> 16th. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8463.803s">It</a> was on Craigslist in the food service blog.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8595.888s">When</a> you say you don't further, we don't know where the city property begins or where the city property ends. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8600.171s">And</a> I think the city's engineers got to get down there and figure out what belongs to us.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8889.511s">Madam</a> President, we all know, and I guess at the beginning, I thought it was to the great betterment of the school department that they got a $2 million increase on their side of the ledger. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8903.864s">for</a> the 2014-2015 budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8908.387s">But</a> after doing some initial investigation, it appears like those monies did not find their way into something that I'm going to revert back to Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8920.355s">When</a> you first came on, I believe it was at the end of your first term, you indicated there was $1.2 million worth of corrections that were needed in the Medford public school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8931.51s">And</a> I don't see any report coming back on that, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8935.652s">Number</a> two, the $1.2 million in corrections, having been talked upon, it's only been talked, if they've done something, it would be nice to get a report. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8946.596s">But</a> approximately 27 positions have been involved or impacted as a result of this $2 million increase, which I believe, if my numbers are correct, is approximately seven new positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8959.785s">And</a> these seven new positions have jobs that are in the $90,000 range, if not more. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8965.368s">And</a> I don't think that's what the people of this community are looking for when they see increases in the school department budget, when there is a lacking of teachers in certain specific classes, in the classroom looking for whether it be books or supplies or things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8984.118s">Just</a> because you haven't had an assistant principal in some school for years, now all of a sudden <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8988.57s">because</a> you got the $2 million, you're going to go back and put an assistant principal in, which could be nothing more than maybe a political job, a favor to give to somebody. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8997.817s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8998.798s">But</a> I just think it's kind of like wrong that these 27 positions or thereabouts that have been impacted, of seven of which are probably brand new or thereabouts are brand new, with $90,000 salaries, if not more, represents the $2 million increase into the school department budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9014.17s">I</a> don't even know if the city can afford another $2 million this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9018.341s">to</a> sustain the $2 million from last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9021.424s">So,</a> what I'd be asking for, Mr. President, is — Mr. President, I'd be asking that the superintendent of the school department — oh, let me tell you another story. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9029.951s">I</a> went up to the high school the other day, and I walked into — walking into that high school in the front. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9035.416s">It's</a> a war zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9036.396s">It</a> looks like that school has gone through a war. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9039.939s">The</a> cement is all broken. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9041.621s">The</a> bricks are — <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9043.258s">The</a> bricks are just shuffled. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9044.999s">There's</a> loose pieces of concrete. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9046.701s">The</a> door's walking into the front entrance. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9049.483s">It's</a> an embarrassment, if you were a taxpayer to this community, to walk up to that school and say, this is my high school, and this is the high school where I want to send my children to. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9058.15s">I</a> don't understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9060.151s">I</a> just can't understand what they don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9064.815s">The</a> young lady who came up here a little while ago, she talked about taking 5% of the budget for each building. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9070.343s">Well,</a> if we remember correctly, on the new school buildings, there was supposed to have been 5% on an annual basis until those buildings were paid off. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9078.146s">But</a> of course, the State Department of Education didn't have auditors to come in to check and see if 5% on an annual basis was being reinvested each and every year on those school buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9087.591s">And</a> now all of a sudden, whether it's a million two, could it be up to a million four? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9091.552s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9092.513s">Maybe</a> we should get a review of that also, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9095.934s">Just</a> what are the damages that need to be corrected in these buildings? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9100.266s">But</a> it's quite obvious that this $2 million has now become a political football in the school department wherewithal for the purposes of jobs and whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9111.976s">I</a> thought and I believed that the $2 million was going to be for educational purposes, teachers, books, supplies, things that are desperately needed, and maybe monies to be used to repair some of the buildings <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9127.505s">that</a> have been so delinquent for so long and not getting repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9131.767s">And</a> that's not happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9133.268s">So</a> I'd like to report back, you know, I don't know where the school committee is on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9137.83s">You</a> know, I think they have an obligation to explain this. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9140.671s">And</a> also, and also, and I don't know where we're going with this, but the scuttlebutt now is, and I'll wait one more week before I put this on the agenda, but the scuttlebutt is now, and it would be nice if we were told about this, that the high school is trying to merge the vocational school <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9156.655s">with</a> the high school and only leave three or four certain classes that are certified and make the other classes nothing more than electives. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9165.077s">The</a> Medford Vocational School has been a wonderful asset to the community of the city of Medford for students who just are not college bound. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9174.879s">There</a> are students that want to be plumbers, auto repair person, auto mechanics, workshop folks, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9184.482s">whatever</a> the trades people are looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9189.205s">And</a> now for the school department to be talking and thinking of merging and only leaving three or four certified positions up there as it relates to these type of work entities and have the rest become nothing more than, you know, electives that kids in the high school can go back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9207.036s">It</a> defeats the whole purpose of a vocational school education. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9210.858s">So</a> I'm going to make this in three counts, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9215.177s">I</a> think maybe we should just meet with the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9217.859s">Maybe</a> we should have a joint meeting with the school committee for the purposes of investigating not only the $2 million, but discuss the $2 million, discuss the problems of the city, and discuss the makeup of that, and also to discuss just what are they trying to do with the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9235.372s">Merge</a> it? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9236.473s">End</a> it? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9238.115s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9239.144s">But</a> you have teachers that are very confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9240.685s">You</a> have students that are really upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9242.326s">You</a> have parents that are upset, because when they talk to me, I have no idea what they're talking about, because apparently this has been going on, and it hasn't been advertised, and nothing's been written about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9252.112s">So</a> this is a major change to our public school education, if the vocational school is now going to be transformed into some type of community school within the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9262.118s">That's</a> not what vocational education is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9265.2s">Absolutely</a> not. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9266.781s">So</a> I'm going to ask, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9268.459s">that</a> over and beyond having a joint meeting with the school committee, I'd like to have a report back as to A, number one, the $2 million that have been spent for this year's budget, names of individuals and salaries attached to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9283.266s">Two,</a> the repairs that Councilor Caraviello brought to the council, I think it was some three years ago of approximately $1.2 million that we get a list of all the repairs and the projected costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9296.353s">Three,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9298.458s">What</a> are they doing about this vocational school as it relates to changing the purpose that it presently operates under as to merging it with the high school? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9310.902s">Fourth,</a> why is the front entrance to Medford High School in such a terrible state of affairs? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9321.385s">And</a> lastly, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9322.682s">to</a> have a joint meeting with the school committee on all these matters.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9561.076s">Well,</a> all you have to do is look up at the ceiling over there and you wonder what's taken so long to get that fixed, whether it's the stairs in front of the police station, the stairs in front of the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9572.442s">This</a> is the whole idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9573.403s">How</a> would the priorities are set? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9574.903s">Just</a> reverting back to Councilor Longo-Curran when she talked about, you know, look at the lunch mothers who haven't received diddly in years for a pay raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9585.009s">And</a> they're there every day taking care of the kids in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9588.443s">And</a> if I understand some of these bumps that the $2 million afforded, they gave people in management positions pay raises or they escalated their pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9599.277s">But</a> I don't understand how you can do that if you've already had a budget that was voted upon, which your salary is supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9605.082s">And</a> I don't know if you can turn around and do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9607.144s">I</a> mean, that's what needs to be explained to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9609.466s">This</a> is kind of like crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9611.188s">If</a> you're getting paid $60,000, $70,000 a year, then how can you turn around and get another $6,000 or $7,000 or $8,000 out of this $2 million? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9618.955s">Whether</a> you're an administrator or rank and file, it doesn't cut the mustard. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9623.299s">This</a> $2 million was supposed to be for education. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9626.998s">not</a> for personal engrangement for certain people that work in that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9632.264s">It</a> should have been for teachers, classrooms, books, supplies, and maybe at the outset it should have been for repairs to the school buildings, because that's what's desperately needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9643.615s">You</a> spent $112 million for new buildings, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9646.783s">And</a> as of two and a half years ago, there were a million two in need of repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9650.426s">God</a> knows what the amount is right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9652.508s">But</a> they know how to feather their own nest, their own pocketbook with their own pay raises without acknowledging this. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9658.293s">I</a> think this is a very crucial matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9660.576s">You</a> have people on the school committee wanting to run for the city council and not acknowledging any of these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9666.961s">These</a> are the issues that are every day that are confronting the city and the taxpayers and the students that go to that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9673.83s">You</a> have whether they're the lunch mothers, who sometimes say they're the lowest ones on the rung because they don't get acknowledged, or you go all the way up to the superintendent, who gets the highest pay of anyone in the entirety. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9684.558s">Something's</a> got to be understood and explained, and not just at the budget time. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9688.821s">And</a> we have asked so many times ahead of time to have these joint meetings between the school department and the council and vice versa. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9695.246s">So</a> you have four separate issues here, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9697.888s">And</a> then you have a fifth issue to have a joint meeting <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9700.189s">with</a> the school department, so it would be great to get all these answers ahead of time so we could have our joint meeting, so we could have some sense of understanding to know where we're going, rather than walk into a meeting and just look at each other like a bunch of dopes. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9713.534s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9714.674s">Councilor</a> Langley-Curran?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9769.516s">Yeah,</a> on the point of information regarding the motion to sever, and Councilor Knight can do whatever he wants as it relates to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9774.978s">Fact</a> of the matter is this city council makes the final vote on the city and the school department budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9779.735s">And</a> this city council was informed that the school department was given a $2 million increase during our budget with absolutely no explanation as to what and how. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9787.54s">And</a> now that this has now been surfacing and people are asking questions and there are some concerns as it relates to how and why the $2 million was spent and now which precipitates all these other issues, whether it be the vocational school, whether they're merging, they're not merging, whether it's people getting raises, schools are getting raises. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9803.413s">whether</a> the entrance to the high school is gonna be, it is our bailiwick, it is our responsibility, and it's the school department's responsibility to talk about it and acknowledge it, and they haven't.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10204.353s">Let's</a> be clear about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10205.714s">When</a> we were presented a budget and we were told that the school department had an increase of $2 million, there was nothing presented in the budget as in the entire other part of the budget of the school department budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10216.599s">Each</a> department was broken down. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10218.403s">with</a> the names and the salaries of each and every individual. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10221.205s">So</a> this is on and after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10223.266s">So</a> this information that's being requested is nowhere to be found in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10227.228s">And</a> I think it's our, I think we're entitled to have it as we were getting everything prior to the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10234.613s">So</a> on that motion, all those in favor.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10321.946s">Yeah,</a> the front main entrance, the front entrance, you know, an update on this, an update as to, you know, how they intend to fix it, when. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10329.133s">and</a> how it's gone into such poor repair.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10484.553s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10486.575s">Yeah,</a> just reflecting back on what Councilor Lungo-Koehn alluded to on this Thursday coming up in the high school on the continuation of the drug issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10494.12s">Today</a> there was a forum that was held publicly outside here in front of the city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10498.7s">at</a> three o'clock with some 50 plus individuals as it related to NACAM and the fact that they're still waiting from the police department and the fire department for coming forward and whether they're going to allow or whether they're going to use NACAM. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10513.924s">Um,</a> the unfortunate part is there's still no response back. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10518.225s">Supposedly</a> it's a union issue that they're waiting to negotiate. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10521.685s">Um,</a> you know, there's nine cities and towns around us that haven't, um, what the negotiation entails or includes, I don't know, but, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10529.008s">We</a> all know from the vigil that took place about a month and a month and a half ago, um, that we were led to believe that by the end of March, um, and this, uh, it was March or April, excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10538.556s">It</a> was going to be, um, set in motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10540.637s">Let's</a> put it this way.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10550.785s">Let</a> me finish. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10551.546s">The</a> gentleman from Armstrong ambulance indicated that they have administered it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10555.867s">but</a> the surrounding, the nine surrounding cities and towns who have police and fire that likewise administered, sometimes they are there before the Armstrong ambulance, and sometimes they're in a position that no one else is in where they could possibly save someone's life. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10569.717s">So</a> what the detail and hanging up is, I don't know, but I think we need to get a report back from both the fire department and the police department on just where are we on allowing them to, or allowing them to have NACOM <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10584.732s">on</a> their persons, so to speak, on their property when they're on duty for the purposes of an overdose. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10591.775s">I</a> guess you can't use that. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10592.795s">Part</a> of the clarification.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11540.622s">We</a> also received a paper that was requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11544.384s">Um,</a> it goes back to, I think council Caraviello's original original request to summer 23rd asking for a report regarding the finances as to what they have taken in, um, for the period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11555.648s">So</a> for the month of January, February, March, they have taken in $223,964. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11562.86s">Um,</a> citations issued in January were 1,035 and February was 1,834. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11567.721s">And</a> in March it was 2,396 expired meters were 41% permitted zones was 19% snow bands is 13% and over time on the meters was 4%. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11584.326s">The</a> one thing that seems to be very telling here in their description notes, it says changes in the meter enforcement hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11591.3s">from</a> 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11592.04s">to</a> 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11593.241s">to</a> 8 to 6, significantly reduced meter and citation revenue potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11599.064s">And</a> unfortunately, that's okay as far as I'm concerned, because these bounty hunters need to leave this town anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11605.227s">Chris</a> Cappe. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11606.268s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Knight.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11618.12s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11619.26s">I</a> believe also, Mr. President, I believe also that, um, Chris Capri, um, who was a hairdresser in Medford square also has in her possession in excess of, I believe over 225 signatures, mostly all method people who come to her shop who are not only opposed to this, but it doesn't serve in the best interest because again, the signage is still yet to be posted, um, as it should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11646.94s">We</a> also know that the chief was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11650.182s">Unfortunately,</a> the mayor or his representative was not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11653.103s">Our</a> budget director, who was also a part of this, was in her office during this whole meeting and left the building after this meeting took place when, you know, she was one of the people that orchestrated this whole parking program. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11665.39s">And</a> this is the problem with this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11668.011s">They</a> don't want to own up to the things that are taking place in this building that they were a part of. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11672.194s">Defend</a> it if you want, or not defend it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11674.375s">But</a> the fact of the matter is, the purpose of this meeting <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11677.23s">was</a> to have an intelligent discussion, hopefully with the people within the administration that could either make the right decision or correct the decisions that need to be corrected. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11686.532s">The</a> unfortunate part to all of this, Mr. President, I don't know where we're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11690.052s">I</a> think the council has been pretty adamant, and they've acknowledged, you know, where they want to go as it relates to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11697.634s">And</a> the clue that doesn't seem to — they didn't tell you, and I believe it's — they have 600. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11706.524s">citations</a> that they had to negate because of the wrongness of the citations being issued. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11712.287s">Over</a> 600 — that's 200 a month, if you average it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11716.99s">That's</a> a phenomenal amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11719.071s">And</a> I believe, also, Mr. Nash acknowledged at the time when I asked him the question, they were supposed to have a job fair, and they didn't have no job fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11725.854s">They</a> were supposed to advertise over the Internet, and they didn't advertise over the Internet. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11729.136s">They</a> were supposed to publicly advertise, and they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11731.037s">The</a> only thing they did was advertise <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11732.708s">and</a> the local press. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11734.49s">So</a> that was amongst other major breaches to this contract that relates to Republican, the city of Medford, for which the council voted five to two, two weeks ago to have them time for them to leave the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11747.621s">And</a> I, and I, and I stick by that, Mr. President, it's time for them to leave the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11752.545s">They're</a> serving no purpose, but to cause aggravation and concern here, the bounty hunters coming in here, sucking off the taxpayers of this city, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11761.203s">to</a> make a 68 to 70% profit on the returns, leaving the city with a diddly amount of money.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11847.96s">Madam</a> President, Ruth Balzer is a State Representative from Newton. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11852.361s">And</a> she filed this bill after consulting with other local <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11856.944s">folks</a> and communities as it relates to local access. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11859.506s">The</a> bill requires that any monies received by municipalities for PEG access cable television be distributed to PEG access cable television. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11867.373s">That's</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11868.153s">If</a> a municipality fails to forward the funds, then it must provide an accounting, and the accounting has to go public. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11874.539s">The</a> bill requires cable TV providers to locate PEG channels in close proximity to broadcast channels. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11880.724s">It</a> requires cable TV providers to provide PEG channels with access <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11885.278s">high-definition</a> or other technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11887.079s">It</a> also requires cable TV providers to provide proper mapping of channels. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11892.802s">Now,</a> this seems to be kind of interesting, because last week, as you know, I introduced some information disclosed by a group of individuals, legally chartered, called Stop the Cap. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11907.97s">And</a> Stop the Cap is a group of people throughout the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11910.931s">It's</a> a <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11912.623s">Broadband</a> Comcast, it's a broadband watchdog group promoting better broadband, it fights data caps, usage-based billing, and other internet overcharging schemes. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11922.666s">That</a> for which Comcast is presently doing here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11926.427s">As</a> a matter of fact, Comcast, if you read it now in the Better Business Bureau, is now being regarded as one of the worst corporations in this country for the purposes of public service and for its charges. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11937.851s">Two</a> weeks ago, I believe, we introduced before the council <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11941.094s">our</a> State's Attorney General going after the community of Lynn for their misappropriation of money, lack of keeping proper records and minutes, and a host of other issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11951.62s">Most</a> recently, as of April 26, the city of Lynn now has asked for a receiver to go in and take over the channel the public access chase in following months of turmoil and alleged financial breaches that have triggered lawsuits and the arrest of the husband on the board <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11968.113s">and</a> a description of the use of the monies that have gone to people working there and the misuse of salaries coming out of the funding from the local access station. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11978.457s">Similar,</a> quite similar to that for which is taking place here in the city of Medford, for which the mayor has been not only dilatory, but he has failed. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11986.68s">He</a> has failed in recognizing that the sham of a filing of a dissolution <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11993.792s">by</a> the Channel 3 board back in, I think it was October or September of 2013, has never been completed, has never taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12003.459s">And</a> as a result of that, what we have here is a combination of now coming up next Thursday, an ascertainment hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12011.766s">Two</a> weeks ago, last week, this council, I asked this council to vote to change, to make the, change the meeting from 2 in the afternoon to 6, 630 at night, because who the heck can go <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12021.585s">at</a> 2 o'clock in the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12023.246s">The</a> mayor re-advertises the hearing for next Thursday to be held at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12028.208s">So</a> nothing has been accomplished as it comes to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12030.85s">But</a> the fact of the matter is, in Somerset, in another locality, like I said, in Belmont, in Somerset, having these ascertainment hearings, these ascertainment hearings are done in advance, well in advance, before the renewal of a contract takes place with the cable provider. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12047.697s">We</a> are operating here in the city of Medford with no contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12050.699s">We</a> have no contract right now because the contract time has come and ended as of April 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12055.822s">And</a> with that being ended yet, we're having an ascertainment hearing well after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12059.885s">So</a> Comcast is nothing more than a tenant at will, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12063.507s">The</a> unfortunate part about all of this is when we were led to believe that for whether we agreed or disagreed, public access was going to find its new home up at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12072.713s">Come</a> to find out that the new home at the high school, for whatever it might be worth, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12076.553s">everything</a> has now been put on hold. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12078.653s">So</a> the monies that allegedly are sitting in the coffers at City Hall in excess of $300,000 that ratepayers have paid to access is now not going to be used for a facility up at the high school, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12091.096s">Number</a> two, the mayor is now not going forward with the public access station for the purposes of saying, you know, we're going to have public access here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12101.458s">This</a> would make two elections in a row that this mayor <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12104.218s">has</a> intentionally denied the taxpayers of this community and people who might be running for office the ability to be on public access and to tell your story for whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12115.022s">And</a> it's also denying taxpayers and rate payers in this community the use of public access for educational and social purposes, because that's what public access is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12124.126s">Now,</a> when Comcast went before, and I think it was this past week, Comcast was denied its merger with Time Warner by the Federal Trading Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12132.602s">because</a> they felt there was too much of a conglomerate, that they would have too much of a control taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12138.164s">But</a> the mayor was one of 52 mayors in this country that signed the letter supporting Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12145.387s">And</a> in the commentary in the Broadband News Journal, the mayor and the 51 other mayors were considered to be shills, shills for Comcast to have this go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12157.432s">And</a> they have a delineated description of what these mayors got as perks <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12162.167s">particular</a> parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12163.348s">From</a> the best of knowledge that we have right now, the mayor got on an annual basis $2,500 for his golf tournament, and he got an annual $10,000 a year for his lights and whatever he wants to do in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12174.735s">No</a> other ratepayer gets that privilege. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12176.836s">They</a> don't get these privileges when they buy their Comcast privilege, or their Comcast, you know, whatever you call it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12187.013s">Internet</a> service or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12190.859s">Why</a> should the mayor get this personal park for himself? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12193.524s">for</a> signing a 10-year contract, a 10-year contract, that now, if you go into it and reading about all the advances that are out there and all the technology that's waiting to be served, Apple started with it, Amazon is into it, and there's a whole host of other ones that are telling you, not only through streaming, but through the way that they can bring cable television into the communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12216.717s">We</a> don't need another 10-year contract getting ourselves locked in. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12220.019s">And</a> the fact of the matter is, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12221.855s">It's</a> the upstreaming of the rates that we're going to be saddled with for another 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12227.201s">It's</a> bad enough you got a 10-year contract that was renegotiated for the waste management. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12231.705s">You</a> got a 10-year contract that was negotiated for this stupid republic from Tennessee. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12236.288s">And</a> now we're looking at possibly another 10-year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12239.009s">And</a> I would hope that this mayor does not sign this contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12242.23s">He</a> is going out of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12244.23s">He</a> is retiring. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12245.33s">He</a> is no longer the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12246.791s">The</a> same way he is holding off hiring a public works director and letting a new person come in, he should likewise do the same thing on this particular issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12255.975s">This</a> ascertainment hearing is nothing more than a dog and pony show. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12259.257s">It's</a> just a sham because the fact of the matter is there is no public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12263.739s">The</a> public access that was recommended by his three-member committee was to have a local front door place where people could actually see it, not to be putting it up in the wildernesses up at the high school where at nighttime when it's dark, you go into the back of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12278.827s">And</a> now God knows what's going on up at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12281.088s">Like</a> I said, I hope we get this answer back if there is some kind of <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12285.483s">Something</a> going on, that there's some kind of a merger between the high school and the vocational school, and this isn't even going to be a part of it, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12293.066s">But</a> the fact of the matter is that needs to be discussed, as we know, as a separate issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12296.888s">But</a> Representative Bowser, I would hope that she gets in touch with Representative Gobley, and Donato, and Christine Barber, and also Senator Jalen. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12313.52s">and</a> seek their support for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12315.481s">Public</a> access is on the throes of being challenged throughout the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12319.443s">There's</a> 1,800 locations throughout the country right now that Comcast and Verizon are challenging whether to accept them or not because they feel it's a cost demand upon them. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12331.41s">They're</a> not realizing what the value that public access has. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12334.872s">The</a> unfortunate part that we have a 5% charge here, this city has a 5% <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12341.585s">inclusion</a> in Comcast payments. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12344.366s">Three</a> percent goes to the city's general funds, one percent goes to public access, and the other one goes to the high school for educational, and the other one goes to the police department, which is the old Channel 16, which is now, I think it's what, Channel 22. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12359.629s">Maybe</a> the review needs to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12361.549s">Get</a> rid of the three percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12363.009s">Keep</a> your public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12364.53s">Give</a> a chance to have the rate payers have a reduction. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12367.357s">and</a> absolutely give no perks to any one individual that signs this contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12371.338s">I</a> don't see any one councilor over here getting a perk, getting a perk as the mayor has for his years of serving with Comcast and the perks that he gets maybe with waste management, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12384.542s">But</a> I know that there is a $5,000 inclusion in the waste management contract that the mayor has to use at his leisure at any part of the city for whatever he wants to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12395.068s">He's</a> only signing that contract because he's supposed to be looking out for the best interest of this community, not for the best interest of him or her or whoever it might be in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12404.31s">That's</a> what these contracts offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12406.09s">These</a> are the inducements that these big guys come in and offer for whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12410.891s">I</a> would hope next week, when we have the ascertainment hearing, folks do come. <a

o'clock in the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12421.112s">And</a> my recommendation is to make the issuing authority the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12425.166s">not</a> the chief executive, because the Medford City Council hears the pulse of the people, they can understand what's going on, and there is a rationale of reason that can take place without having the singular person, he or she, make that singular decision on behalf of 18,000 ratepayers between Comcast and Verizon.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12785.862s">On</a> the motion, the legislation, I think, is very succinct where it gets to the second page. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12790.565s">It</a> basically says, whereas residents across the Commonwealth wish to keep in touch with their local government by viewing their city council or selectmen meetings, school committee and other commission meetings, chamber events, high school sports, regional and statewide legislative affairs shows, groundbreaking ceremonies, retirement dinners, dance recitals, school plays, and much more. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12810.556s">And</a> whereas the culture and definition surrounding <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12814.1s">Cable</a> television is changing rapidly, and community media is only supported through the cable television franchise agreements. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12822.187s">That's</a> in essence what this is, whether it's amended up or down. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12827.491s">Wait</a> a minute, can you let me finish? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12829.533s">What,</a> are you in a rush to go home? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12831.355s">For</a> God's sakes, just slow down. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12834.437s">This</a> is part of the thing before we have our motion to table.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12923.059s">We're</a> going to follow the rules or not, but it's been laid on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12927.162s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12927.422s">A</a> little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12928.763s">We</a> don't never get stopped. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12930.104s">I</a> don't understand this.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=138.486s">On</a> that motion, some years ago before council and I came on the council, this was an issue that was brought up at that point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=148.315s">And</a> I believe one of the concerns we had was that our building department were getting complaints from people who were renting out rooms, if not spaces, within the homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=161.843s">And</a> some of them went to college kids, some of them went to transients, and some of them were just for the purposes of, you know, raising some money. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=168.167s">I</a> believe then, at the time, when Councilor Burke was on the council, she had offered a resolution as it related to the fact of maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=178.24s">going</a> forward in addressing this particular matter so as to make it a revenue-producing part of the real estate that the rental properties were on. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=188.403s">Now,</a> the comment that you made, Councilor Knight, is basically the same thing that came back then when the conversation took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=196.065s">I</a> believe there was a side mechanism that could be involved in that, and that would be through zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=202.747s">If</a> the zoning does not or does allow for it, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=207.113s">then</a> I believe it becomes an issue that you don't need the Department of Revenue to indicate whether it's legal or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=214.396s">We</a> were supposed to then at that point in time get an answer back. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=217.037s">I</a> don't know, we might even have something in our law department on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=220.899s">But</a> I'd like to amend your motion to go one step further to have a report back. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=225.781s">If</a> we were to do this, can we do this through our zoning ordinance change, make a change specifically in the zoning ordinances, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=234.502s">that</a> would either allow or disallow that type of a, of an issue to take place.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=246.39s">I</a> would like to amend counts and nights resolution to look into having a law department look into the legalese, so to speak, of whether to allow or whether we can allow or disallow depending on which way you want to use this mechanism. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=262.072s">to</a> be included within specific or particular zoning areas in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=267.074s">So</a> that way there, let's just say someone has a two-family house, or they want to rent out a room, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=273.576s">I</a> believe if you look at our zoning charts, it'll not be allowed, or it is allowed, or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=279.037s">But</a> if it has to be included in there to make itself regulatory for the purposes of taxation, you can do that through zoning.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=370.004s">One</a> particular addendum to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=371.765s">One</a> of the concerns that were brought up at that point in time when this was discussed <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=375.779s">some</a> years back was if, in fact, you are renting out that room or a particular part of the house, the parking situation as it relates to cars and within the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=384.764s">And</a> I think that's something that, again, through the law department, I think that's one of the things you need to have addressed.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=636.148s">Mr.</a> President, members of the council, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=638.432s">and</a> also our citizen taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=641.253s">I</a> think the resolution goes a little bit deeper than the highlight that's basically saying there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=645.755s">I</a> know tomorrow night we are supposedly having a meeting as it relates to the parking meter system here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=653.518s">And</a> we all know what's been going on as it relates to this mayor's parking program here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=661.501s">Just</a> a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=662.522s">The</a> meeting is going to take place at six o'clock tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=665.283s">Allegedly,</a> our chief of police, the mayor, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=668.374s">The</a> people from Republic, from Tennessee are going to be there, and hopefully any and all interested citizens who have a concern as it relates to what this is all about and how they've been impacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=681.437s">But</a> during this past week, and then once again, I don't know where we begin and where we end with all of this, because it's becoming a nonstop issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=690.658s">I'll</a> jump on to you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=693.499s">On</a> the issue with the meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=695.233s">They</a> still say 7 in the morning to 7 at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=697.975s">OK?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=698.535s">And</a> as a result of them saying 7 in the morning to 7 at night, the fact of the matter is, I still see people trying to put the money in the machine. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=706.74s">They</a> were supposed to correct it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=707.681s">That's</a> nothing more than simple terminology. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=710.643s">They</a> haven't changed the screens, and that's another issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=714.185s">Speaking</a> with the folks down in Riverside Avenue today, just today, because I unfortunately haven't been around for a while, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=722.467s">speaking</a> of the fact, the rudeness of the individuals, the rudeness of the individuals, and how they talk to the patrons utilizing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=730.23s">They</a> finally, from what I understand, just finally highlighted the back of the van that basically says, this truck makes frequent stoppings, and that's all to be included here in the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=742.654s">I</a> want to thank one of our citizen taxpayers, Michael O'Jerry, who comes up here almost every week <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=748.05s">And</a> he's been very insightful, and he's been very helpful to me, because in my discussions back and forth, we have labored over conversations as it relates to contents within the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=758.997s">But</a> the contract has very specific sections as it relates to performance duties and responsibilities that not only the city has, but more importantly, the operator has. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=769.484s">And</a> those duties and responsibilities do come within the first 90 days of the contract, or within the first year, depending on how you want to read this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=777.499s">and</a> take advantage of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=778.939s">But</a> we all know what took place yesterday, which is absolute disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=782.48s">These</a> people, these out-of-town bounty hunters from Tennessee, yesterday were tagging people all across the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=788.822s">City</a> Hall was closed yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=790.623s">There</a> was no rubbish picked up yesterday in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=793.363s">Nowhere</a> in government was there to be operating. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=796.844s">And</a> what do we have? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=797.584s">We</a> have out-of-town bounty hunters going around, tagging people and making their lives miserable here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=804.526s">I</a> think we all received, if not all of you, at least I received, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=807.816s">Three</a> of them, through the email today, would pitch us not only of the tickets, but of the tags, and the people saying, I'm not even going to appeal it, I'm going to pay it, but I am not going back to that place of business again, because it's just absolutely wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=820.582s">If</a> this is what we have denigrated our community to, I just think it's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=827.126s">It's</a> absolutely wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=828.847s">I</a> had made a resolution, I believe some four weeks ago, and then I had brought it up again at another time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=836.476s">And</a> then I was asked not to force the council or put the council in a position to take a vote until we have this meeting tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=844.661s">You</a> folks as Councilors, you can have this meeting all you want tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=848.043s">But</a> I am moving here right now, tonight, as a result of this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=851.965s">And</a> I believe you have my paper up there too, as it talks to under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=856.708s">I</a> am sure you can introduce it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=859.59s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=859.93s">Put</a> it in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=860.991s">Yep.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=876.679s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=877.479s">And</a> this is what we're briefing upon it because right now the briefing upon this is very, very brief as far as I'm concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=885.005s">I</a> am not going to go any further with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=887.246s">And</a> before I go over to my colleague, Councilor Camuso, I just want to <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=893.882s">say</a> to Councilor Marks, I mean, it was his insight dating back some five years ago with the committee that he served on that basically said we should have nothing more than a traffic enforcement program. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=906.093s">Let's</a> start it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=907.194s">Let's</a> see where we're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=908.755s">When</a> my resolution came up, I think it was three weeks ago, and you asked to lay it on the table, which I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=913.92s">I</a> believe at that point in time, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=915.472s">It</a> was your druthers council's marks that said, you know, maybe we should, if we're going to get rid of it, maybe we should think about having a traffic enforcement program, set it small, keep it in house. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=925.054s">And</a> at that point in time, take it to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=927.875s">I</a> am, I want to, I'm going to move on my resolution as I had. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=931.716s">And</a> council Camuso, he can speak on it as well because we've discussed this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=935.977s">I</a> am going to move that the city of Medford drop out whatever the proper terminology might be to cease its operations with Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=945.29s">because</a> of their multiple violations, for which I won't acknowledge here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=949.732s">I'll</a> put it in writing if the clerk wants it or if the city solicitor wants it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=952.953s">The</a> multiple sections of the contract that have been totally violated by the operator and for which the city and for which our own chief of police has publicly acknowledged that he has warned them, advised them what to do, what to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=965.738s">I</a> have brought in here week after week with pictures. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=967.539s">I</a> have brought in the fact that they haven't honored their contract for lettering of their trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=971.421s">They</a> haven't honored their contracts for the kiosk, for the Times, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=974.822s">the</a> collections of the money, and after yesterday, I think that was the ultimate straw. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=979.566s">So</a> I'm moving, Mr. President, that the council take official position to A, terminate its contract with Tennessee, and B, to support the resolution offered by Councilman Marks, which basically says that the city look at and investigate its own traffic enforcement program for the purposes of the parking, the signage, which is two hours, 30 minutes, whatever it might be, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1002.078s">at</a> least take that position and then begin to go forward.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1009.262s">No,</a> I said advising the Mayor to terminate the contract.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1375.397s">Councilor</a> Camuso, it wasn't the people I spoke to. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1377.818s">It</a> was the people working the streets, not the people at the office. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1380.319s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1380.999s">Number</a> two, I believe inclusive of that resolution that you have in there, there is also a request for my resolution for a roll call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1389.342s">And</a> that's the thing that was laid in the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1391.142s">Now</a> we have two of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1392.563s">So</a> if you get to the, if you look at the official minutes and if you look at the record on the resolution, there was a request <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1399.258s">The</a> one that just took off the table, Eddie. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1400.698s">The</a> one that came off the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1401.599s">The</a> one that came off the table had a request for a vote.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1830.196s">Mr.</a> President, I thank my colleagues for their comments, but once again, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1835.567s">One</a> of the issues that were brought up in this thing is the parking spaces in the permit parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1841.011s">And</a> on page two of the contract, one of the things that really, I think, have riled some of the neighborhood folks is, A, maintain and update permit database. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1849.096s">B,</a> redo, hold, revoke, and reinstate, reactivate permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1853.178s">C,</a> update all permit files. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1855.62s">D,</a> inquire into permit data. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1857.691s">and</a> E, billing and payment for permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1859.452s">And</a> all of those issues, those five issues, have been really bones of controversy with the parking program and the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1867.555s">I</a> mean, we have folks from South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1869.675s">We</a> have people from Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1870.736s">We</a> have people on streets that have permit parking that are getting tickets, and they have the stickers right on their cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1877.058s">We</a> also have the fact that into the contract, it basically says that the city has its exclusive right within its initial time period, which I believe is the first three months, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1887.466s">for</a> the purposes of, hey, taking an investigation and looking at and reviewing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1891.528s">And</a> by looking and reviewing, we're not going anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1894.589s">The</a> fact of the matter is, Councilor Marks, you just hit something on the head that probably we should have brought up before, and that's this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1901.151s">People</a> said there are more spaces now available than there was before. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1905.813s">Where</a> those spaces that are available, go to the stores, go to the merchants in front of the stores where those spaces are, and ask them if those spaces are helping or hurting their business. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1915.788s">And</a> I think the answer is very pronouncedly, no, it's not helping their business at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1920.39s">You</a> know, this is, you know, on page four of the contract, in the event that the operator terminates the agreement or, quote, ceases to perform its obligations herein prior to the completion of the initial term, that's the beginning, that's it, they're out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1936.137s">And</a> I think with that being said, and I'm not going to rehash it, I'm moving to terminate it, thank Councilor Camuso for being part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1943.502s">And</a> the resolution, I believe, speaks for itself, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2496.293s">Mr.</a> President, in regards to Councilor Knight's remark, I'd like to refer back to our city clerk, Ed Finn. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2502.357s">I</a> think it was last Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2503.858s">I</a> had called Mr. Finn up and I asked him for something that the council included in the resolution that we brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2509.341s">I</a> think we had asked for all the resolutions that had been sent to the traffic commission for the purposes of their action and those that have not been acted upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2517.306s">Did</a> that ring a bell, Mr. Finn? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2523.33s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2524.51s">And</a> the request was to have it for our packet this weekend so we could review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2529.674s">The</a> chief responded back, said, it's not ready yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2532.596s">Then</a> the second letter went out and asked them if we could have it before or on tonight's meeting so we do not go to tomorrow's meeting ill-prepared. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2541.103s">And</a> that's just symptomatic of what you're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2543.805s">I</a> don't know what it takes for people to respond to resolutions and requests, but every part of this program is just not working. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2551.591s">It's</a> just a disaster from day one.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2743.405s">I,</a> Rick, we've had multiple conversations about the cars not being properly signage, the back of the cars not being properly signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2751.79s">the</a> kiosks themselves not having proper signage, people putting money in the meter after 6 o'clock at night up until this past week, OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2760.217s">These</a> are multiple issues that have been ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2766.542s">Well,</a> that's their problem for not doing it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3446.894s">To</a> clarify the point that Councilor Longo just alluded to is, number one, I believe what we're referring to was Councilor Marks's suggestion, is that if, in fact, we were going to terminate or eliminate, correct me if I'm wrong, if you're going to terminate or eliminate <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3461.072s">the</a> Republic Company, then we should look into having our own in-house with signage and whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3468.256s">If</a> the confusion is taken away and we just stick to the resolution itself to eliminate and terminate the contract, the first one, the second one is offered by Councilor Camuso and myself because of the breach of the contract, I'd be willing to let everything else go. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3480.982s">Because</a> you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3482.202s">One</a> of the things the mayor said in his newspaper editorial is to <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3486.37s">One</a> of the reasons why he is no longer wanting to serve is because of his inability or his lack of getting along with this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3494.933s">He's</a> never sat down with this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3496.834s">He's</a> never discussed our concerns relative to these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3499.955s">He's</a> made the outrageous statement that he's never received one complaint about this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3506.057s">Well,</a> I mean, if he hasn't received one complaint, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3508.913s">Where's</a> everybody, blind in City Hall that they don't know what's going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3513.978s">Of</a> course, of course it's an issue that it's outstanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3517.161s">And</a> if he wants to leave office magnanimously, and he could stand up here and say, you know something, we all make mistakes, and I made a big mistake by bringing this company in, but I'm going to rectify it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3528.351s">I'm</a> going to listen to you, Council, or I'm going to pull the plug, and we're going to sit down. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3532.234s">Because</a> if he said something correctly, Councilman <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3534.553s">Didn't</a> he say that he's been working on this for five years? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3537.715s">He's</a> been working on this program for five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3540.656s">And</a> you people put a report together. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3542.517s">You</a> people put a report together in September of 2009. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3544.799s">This</a> is now 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3547.1s">What</a> did it take him five to six years to put together? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3553.183s">An</a> out-of-state bounty hunter country company to come in here and disrupt our community? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3559.45s">I'd</a> be willing to forego all the amendments to the resolution, stick to my original one, Councilor, Councilor Camuso, if you want to stick to yours, vote on both of those resolutions, and everything else will work itself out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3572.419s">Because</a> whether he's going to sit down with us or not, it's immaterial. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3576.342s">He</a> hasn't even called us up. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3577.843s">He</a> didn't even give us the courtesy that he wasn't even going to run anymore to bring his legislative body in, the council who approves his budget year in and year out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3589.147s">whether</a> we agree or disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3591.368s">We've</a> had many good days. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3593.369s">We've</a> had, I think, more bad days as of late because of the lack of communication, the lack of conversation, the lack of the wherewithal to put eight heads together instead of one. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3603.754s">And</a> that's why we're in the problem that we're in right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3606.595s">And</a> I believe it was you, Councilor Camuso, who said right from the beginning, you would have favored meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3610.717s">And</a> I think if meters were in, people would have absolutely understood a meter, instead of this crazy, outlandish parking kiosk that you can't see at nighttime, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3618.402s">You've</a> confused every single senior citizen in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3621.142s">You've</a> had people falling down in the snow, having to get an emergency ambulance to go to a hospital, and everything else that's been associated with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3628.304s">So</a> if you're willing to do that, I am willing to forego all of my amendments there, stick to my resolution, Mr. Fenn, as it relates to terminating the contract, and then subsequent with Councilor Camusos, for the same reason, and move on the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3642.586s">And</a> let the chips fall where they may.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4323.028s">I'm</a> leaving my original motion on the indeterminate <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4325.842s">in</a> concert with Councilor Camuso's joint resolution with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4334.204s">For</a> the breach of the contract and to, what's my resolution, Mr. Clark? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4339.166s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4351.649s">We're</a> the one that asked to eliminate, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4355.468s">Wait,</a> that's the... No, it's right there.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4398.342s">15-307.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4398.402s">On</a> the tabled paper, take my resolution to terminate the contract, and then take Councilor Camuso and Councilor Penta's resolution for the breach of the contract.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4410.885s">I</a> made that as an offering if everybody's satisfied. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4413.325s">I'll</a> withdraw mine, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4427.806s">What's</a> the resolution that you have there of mine that was tabled?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4508.791s">That</a> can be the substitute language for that resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4512.574s">On</a> the motion of Councilor Penta,
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4551.397s">He</a> already has them.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4554.719s">That's</a> the resolution.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4899.948s">Wait</a> a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4901.249s">Does</a> the word terminate the contract in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4904.952s">Wait</a> a minute, where's the word terminate at? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4906.653s">Wait</a> a minute, where's the word? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4907.493s">Wait</a> a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4916.696s">To</a> remove the kiosk and terminate the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4920.337s">Put</a> that in the end edit.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4928.1s">Fourth</a> with. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4930.04s">Remove</a> the kiosk and terminate the contract fourth with. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4936.97s">That's</a> the key, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4937.911s">That's</a> the key. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4938.631s">That</a> was going to be a key paper or a separate motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4945.375s">Why</a> do you want it to be part of this?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4950.718s">You</a> have it, Eddie? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4951.198s">All</a> right, read it now.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4955.92s">And</a> to terminate the contract forthwith.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4960.323s">No,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4961.283s">After</a> the word, read the last sentence.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5440.764s">Did</a> I hear you correctly? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5441.944s">Did</a> you said that you would want to edit what goes onto the city website rather than getting the actual true content?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5451.401s">What</a> did you say? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5452.762s">Maybe</a> I misunderstood.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6233.732s">I</a> want to thank counsel a night. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6234.973s">You</a> just lead me into my conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6237.575s">This</a> ascertainment hearing that is scheduled for next Wednesday at two o'clock in the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6241.931s">makes</a> absolutely no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6244.173s">Number</a> one, the contract that the city of Medford has with Comcast Cable has already now been terminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6250.237s">It</a> ended on April 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6252.758s">April</a> 20th has now come and gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6255.24s">An</a> ascertainment hearing, if anybody follows it, is for the purposes of gating information that one would have within a community as it relates to a forthcoming renewal to a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6269.81s">For</a> example, in Belmont, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6271.797s">the</a> Board of Selectmen, who happened to be the issuing authority, and I would hope next Wednesday at that hearing, and I'm going to make the request tonight that the hearing take place at 6.30 at night rather than 2 o'clock in the afternoon, making it available for people. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6284.24s">But</a> the ascertainment hearing, which was offered by the Board of Selectmen, because they were the issuing authority, had a whole bunch of people who came forward that explained what they felt was needed in the community, for example, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6297.861s">Some</a> people complained that their reception was poor. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6301.082s">Other</a> people complained, was it possible to get channels without commercials? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6305.003s">Another</a> one complained, can senior citizens have a special break? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6310.905s">Movie</a> channels were also taken into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6313.966s">They</a> also talked about cable subscriptions and the lack of some cable subscriptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6319.728s">Another</a> resident complained about the unavailability of people to respond to their phone calls instead of a voicemail message and requesting people to leave messages. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6328.112s">Another</a> resident complained about the lack of a food channel and the Fox channels. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6331.995s">And</a> another resident complained about continual increases in the cost for cable services. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6337.238s">And</a> another resident complained about... And we can go on and on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6340.5s">The</a> idea, if you're getting it, is the fact that people had an opportunity to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6344.443s">And</a> for the purposes of them having that opportunity to come, they would be able to explain what was wrong within the cable system within their community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6352.648s">Now,</a> hunting all of this down, in some of the contracts that Comcast has, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6357.808s">There</a> are provisos in the contract that says within a 15-year period of time that a contract takes place. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6365.893s">So</a> that would give you a span of either one or two contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6369.936s">A</a> public survey needs to be done or should be done by Comcast, in this particular case, because we're talking about Comcast, within the community for which they are securing their renewal to the license. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6382.764s">And</a> in that survey, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6385.416s">They</a> would be asking all kinds of questions as it relates to the needs within the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6390.68s">What</a> would you like to see? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6392.241s">What</a> do you think that Comcast could do better? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6394.583s">How</a> do you believe that they could be a better provider within the community? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6398.646s">And</a> with that being said, and I don't believe Medford has ever had it, and with that being said, Philadelphia is a perfect example. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6405.772s">The</a> city of Philadelphia did it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6407.093s">They</a> had a great response from the rate payers within that community, and they got a better reception as it relates to <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6414.863s">you</a> know, the services that Comcast was going to give them. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6419.646s">Also,</a> this merger taking place, the proposed merger to take place between Comcast and Time Warner is really a deadly issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6431.755s">There</a> is a group of a non-profit organization of individuals, it's called Stop the Cap, and these are a citizens-activated watchdog group. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6440.681s">They</a> promote better broadband, they fight data caps, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6444.413s">usage-based</a> billings, and other internet overcharging schemes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6448.414s">And</a> in this particular case, only 52 mayors, only 52 mayors throughout the entire United States of America signed off on this merger. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6458.797s">And</a> who do you think one of the two, one of the 52 mayors was? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6463.119s">It's</a> our mayor and the city of Medford, Mayor McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6466.239s">And</a> what he and the other 51 mayors did, they brought together and they signed a letter <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6472.137s">And</a> in this letter that they signed, that they sent to the FCC, they unfortunately made a big mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6478.56s">Because</a> what they did is it was a terribly misleading letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6482.401s">Because</a> what they did is they took facts and figures from the Comcast proposal that was used as part of their press release. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6492.725s">And</a> the letter was signed, and the text was taken almost, quote, almost entirely from Comcast's own talking points, and the letter <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6502.079s">was</a> misleading in the parts because the facts were inaccurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6505.76s">Now,</a> one other thing a lot of people don't know about, that Comcast and Time Warner have what they call cross-marketing agreements with Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6515.343s">And</a> right now, the three of them do work together, and especially in the western part of our country, and California, and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6522.485s">And</a> the 52 mayors, which includes Mayor McGlynn, advocating for this multi-billion dollar cable merger is not good for the cable subscribers. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6530.273s">Because</a> if this merger succeeds, rates will increase, your delivery and your service will increase or decrease, depending on how you're viewed it, and you'll have no place to turn because you're going to be involved with what they call compulsory user allowance. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6549.24s">And</a> what compulsory user allowance means that whatever Comcast decides to make a decision on, and if this decision goes through with Time Warner, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6558.93s">and</a> Verizon, because they're all working together on this, rate changes and rate charges. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6563.433s">And</a> if they get into this term called compulsory usage allowance, that is going to precipitate the rates and the charges that people are going to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6574.999s">Now,</a> we here in the city of Medford have a very unfortunate circumstance. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6579.902s">We're</a> dealing with a contract that's already been signed. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6583.284s">And</a> if I understand the contract that's already been signed, that's presently existing, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6588.81s">not</a> its renewal, it's part of a three year lapse over from the original contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6594.713s">So</a> we're dealing with the contract that is 13 years old here within our city of Medford, 13 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6602.998s">And</a> what have the rate payers gotten out of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6605.96s">Personally,</a> they've gotten rate increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6610.242s">If</a> you notice on the second box and the second, third and fourth box of the rooms, they've now gone up from 199 to 299. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6615.466s">If</a> you look at the building, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6618.207s">They</a> secretly went up. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6619.867s">But</a> what's interesting here, there's only one person who's had a political gain out of all of this, and that's the mayor of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6626.869s">Because</a> each and every year, while this contract has been in effect, he has received $2,500 for his annual golf classic, for the mayor's golf classic. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6637.911s">Now,</a> does anybody in this council, in the school committee, is there any rate payer out there that gets $2,500 from your cable provider for your golf classic or for whatever you want to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6648.382s">And</a> if, according to the records under the Freedom of Information Act, disclosed, he also gets an additional $10,000 a year for his celebrations committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6657.187s">And</a> what he does with that money and how he celebrates, we don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6661.409s">But</a> isn't that interesting? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6662.79s">We</a> pay our cable rates, and this mayor gets $2,500 a year annually for his golf tournament, and he gets an additional $10,000 for his celebrations committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6672.935s">Now,</a> I ask every member of this council and anyone who might be watching at any rate <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6677.758s">Do</a> you have that luxury and do you have that privilege? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6680.88s">Because</a> the mayor of this community under the present contract is the issuing authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6685.803s">Why</a> should he be given that luxury? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6688.124s">And</a> more importantly, how bold and brazen can he be to let a contract be signed and then he now calls for an ascertainment hearing for next Wednesday at 2 o'clock in the afternoon in the dead of day when people are working <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6703.105s">Who</a> are going to be able to come here? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6705.166s">And</a> then what are you going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6706.507s">Have</a> the poor people come and park behind City Hall and not understand that there's a kiosk there, and you're going to give them a ticket for coming to an ascertainment hearing that relates to their cable bills? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6716.674s">I</a> don't think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6718.155s">So,</a> with all due respect, Mr. President, I just think it's — we have two big issues here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6724.72s">We</a> have one of 252 mayors throughout the entire country <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6730.016s">Only</a> 52 mayors signed off on this merger because maybe those 52 mayors, maybe those 52 mayors were getting special privileges like our mayor was. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6739.844s">I</a> don't think he or anyone else deserved to get a special privilege because he signs a contract in behalf of ratepayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6746.87s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6748.252s">And</a> on the other part, Mr. President, the ratepayers have no vantage point here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6753.376s">I</a> think we need to know what does Verizon, what is Verizon giving to the city of Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6758.838s">What</a> special perks, if any, does the mayor derive from Verizon toward any of A, his charities, or whatever his wants need to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6767.702s">Because</a> they're only enhancing his political background and his political career. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6772.585s">And</a> it is an interesting, because this year here, he normally gets this money midway through the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6778.667s">But</a> this year, I believe he got it early on, because he probably knew he was retiring or getting out of office. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6784.99s">And</a> he took that money as a use for his <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6788.728s">you</a> know, for his political wherewithal, wherever he wants to put it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6792.07s">I</a> think it's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6793.39s">I</a> think Mr. Peter Epstein, who's the attorney who represents the city of Medford for cable issues, whose failure to tell this council when asked if there's going to be a hearing, I don't even know if he's going to be here to do the ascertainment hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6808.558s">But</a> how do you ascertain something after the fact? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6813.6s">Can</a> you tell me that? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6815.101s">I</a> don't think you can answer that, because in your profession, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6817.298s">You</a> can never ascertain anything after the fact, because your clients are already, unfortunately, deceased. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6823.161s">But</a> these people, who are alive and well, don't have that ability. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6828.024s">They</a> don't have the ability to know why and how. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6832.266s">I</a> strongly suggest that anyone who wants to come to the meeting next week, and I hope this council votes that it takes place at 6 o'clock at night, not 2 o'clock in the afternoon, but they eliminate any special perks and privileges <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6846.45s">associated</a> to the issuing authority, whether it be the mayor, the city council, whoever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6853.612s">The</a> fact of the matter is, over $300,000 right now is still sitting in the city's coffers because there's been no public access, I believe, since September of 2013 because of the mayor's failure, and I say intentional failure, to do his job to make sure that the board of directors of Channel 3 <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6875.449s">performed</a> what they were supposed to perform in their motion of dissolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6881.394s">I</a> got to give Martha Healy, the new Attorney General, credit because she went right after the town of Lynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6886.458s">And</a> she put together an absolutely beautiful document going after them for failure of records, failure of minutes, inappropriate spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6897.292s">in</a> basically lying about their jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6899.853s">And</a> that's what took place here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6902.114s">And</a> Judge Jackson, who was paid almost $15,000, wrote that in her report, that if those guys and girls did not get their act together, they should be removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6910.158s">And</a> the mayor is yet, and he has never removed them. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6912.959s">He's</a> been afraid to confront them. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6915.06s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6918.241s">The</a> motion is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6919.002s">Relax.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6919.462s">Don't</a> get nervous. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6920.462s">The</a> motion is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6922.183s">The</a> next week's ascertainment hearing be changed from 2 o'clock in the afternoon <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6926.938s">to</a> 6 o'clock at night to give every single Medford taxpayer who was a rate payer to Comcast Cable an opportunity to speak.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7677.338s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7680.328s">Upon</a> reviewing our resolutions that we've had in the past, and I don't know, you know, where you go with this, I don't know who has a sense of priorities around here or not, but going back, I believe it's the first week in March, and this is now almost getting to the last week of April, those lights in Medford Square are still out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7700.461s">That</a> public safety issue still is looming, and I don't know what it is that this administration doesn't see about the issue of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7710.67s">We</a> heard the chief of police say that the biggest sense of priority and security for a business person is to have a light in front of his. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7717.433s">There's</a> eight of them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7718.514s">There's</a> eight of them out and all within the close proximity to each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7722.736s">And</a> it just doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7725.137s">Beside</a> not having any lights on the Route 16 parking lot, for which this is now the 16th time that we're talking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7733.261s">You</a> know, I don't understand why the mayor was getting out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7736.663s">Maybe</a> I do understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7737.703s">He</a> doesn't want to deal with these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7739.348s">because</a> he maybe doesn't know how to handle them. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7741.029s">He</a> doesn't know how to tell people to go down there and change the street light in a matter of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7746.972s">But</a> it's OK for us to talk about it and talk about it and talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7750.694s">As</a> you've acknowledged, Mr. Council President, when you were sitting on there, on the 13th time we talked about the lights on Route 16, and they're still not done. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7760.038s">So</a> I don't know what it's going to take. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7764.892s">And</a> I don't even know if a new administration can make these changes unless there's a completely new attitude where it's directly people-oriented, not me, myself-oriented, people-oriented, taxpayer-oriented. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7779.162s">You</a> know, we just spent—we increased our school—we increased our budget last year by over $2 million for the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7785.526s">And</a> what did they do? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7786.087s">They</a> went out there and hired administrators, more administrators. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7790.442s">You</a> know, you're looking for quality education, sound education. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7797.549s">You're</a> looking at the herculean issue of Common Core, where it's going here in Massachusetts, and how it's affecting families, and the whole educational process. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7807.039s">What</a> are we going to do this year when the budget comes in? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7809.221s">If</a> we don't have that $2 million extra, where's the cut going to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7814.226s">You</a> know? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7815.173s">So,</a> with that being said, Mr. President, you know, lights are a very important issue to me because they signify public safety, you know, at a minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7824.996s">And,</a> you know, this is now going on two months for those eight lights to be out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7828.337s">And</a> maybe the mayor didn't pay the electric bill this month. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7830.958s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7832.038s">He</a> got his $2,500 ahead of time from Comcast, you know, for a golf tournament. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7837.86s">So,</a> I don't know when he's going to have that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7839.9s">You</a> know, I just don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7840.96s">I</a> don't know what goes through that guy's mind anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7843.042s">You</a> know, maybe you do because you talk to him because he doesn't, you know, didn't he make one of the comments, the reason why he's getting out because he can't get along with the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7851.067s">There's</a> no communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7852.328s">Well,</a> the reason why there's no communication, he doesn't want to talk to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7855.51s">I'd</a> be more than happy to talk to him anytime. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7857.752s">If</a> he came before this podium right now and indicated that I'm going to do that, I've been a little bit remiss. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7863.335s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7863.656s">Mr.</a> Mayor, if he acknowledged that he made a mistake with the kiosk, I would be perfectly happy with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7870.706s">If</a> he turned around and says, okay, I've been a little dilatory on having public access, but this is what we're going to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7875.849s">You're</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7876.469s">It's</a> a real need. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7877.649s">I</a> would be okay with that, but we don't have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7880.231s">We</a> don't have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7881.691s">What</a> are you thanking me for? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7882.652s">You</a> thanking me for my comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7883.932s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7884.913s">I</a> know they're good comments, and they're made on behalf of the taxpayers of this community.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_pkk5OxKuY6w/2025-03-21_pkk5OxKuY6w.html">Medford City Council - April 7, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=30.562s">Present.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=62.744s">Mr.</a> President, I move suspension of the fools to allow a citizen to speak as it relates to her concern.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=451.947s">You</a> made a comment that related to the fact that you have a handicap placard and you've been tagged three times?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=459.0s">And</a> you, did you relate that to the chief of police?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=526.12s">This</a> is, Mr. President, and anyone who might be listening, this is just symptomatic as to what's going on with Republic's attitude here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=533.426s">We</a> have a resolution further on into the agenda that will address some of these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=538.271s">But</a> attacking a person, so to speak, with a handicapped spot <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=543.782s">These</a> people, it's obvious that they're not trained properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=547.003s">They're</a> out-of-towners. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=548.243s">As</a> far as I'm concerned, they're bounty hunters. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=550.124s">They're</a> just coming in here to make as much money as they can at the expense of the taxpayers and small business. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=555.185s">So,</a> when we get to this conversation, Mr. President, as I asked you before, when we have our meeting in some two weeks, this is a serious issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=563.107s">Tagging</a> people, especially people that have a handicapped placard, that's just not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=567.187s">And</a> that shows a complete dereliction of somebody's duty to their job, knowing who they should tag and who they shouldn't tag. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=574.114s">So</a> I thank you for bringing that forward.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=851.77s">Just</a> real quick on Councilor Lungo-Koehn's comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=854.03s">I</a> have pictures here of just this past week and as late as yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=858.744s">with</a> these trucks driving around, driving around, unmarked, in particular locations within the city, on the ring road, and designated spots where they're not supposed to be, giving out tickets at 7.38 a.m., which is supposed to not start until 8 o'clock in the morning, and we can continue on and on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=879.721s">This</a> is in complete violation of the contract on page four of the contract that they have with the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=887.257s">You</a> know, I know, Mr. President, you're having the meeting on the 23rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=890.559s">You</a> know, I don't know how much can be resolved by then. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=892.96s">But</a> it's quite obvious. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=893.761s">And</a> I'll just end it by saying this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=895.182s">You</a> know, they had the contract signed on October 10th of 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=899.424s">And</a> they had the luxury from October 10th, 2014, to January 15th, when it was supposed to be implemented, and strike that first day of implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=907.009s">And</a> on February 3rd, it was Councilor Caraviello's resolution offered before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=911.511s">Because</a> at that point in time, from January 15th to February 2nd, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=914.898s">The</a> screens were so light and hard to read. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=917.619s">The</a> resolution was put on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=919.039s">And</a> as we speak today on April 7th, they're still the same way, hard to read, almost illegible, especially if the sun is out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=926.441s">And</a> we can go through a whole litany of other things beside that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=929.022s">So</a> it's just obvious. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=930.022s">And</a> their public relations, it just doesn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=932.703s">And</a> maybe they had no human resource background on teaching the folks that are going to work here in this city how to handle the people, talk to the people, whether it's permit parking, whether it's just giving people out tickets and what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=945.253s">I</a> think this has been a complete disaster, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=948.334s">This</a> is Mayor McGlynn's program. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=950.095s">He</a> owns it lock, stock, and barrel. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=952.156s">And</a> if anyone has a concern, as you continue to have concerns, please call his office and tell him that you're dissatisfied and you want resolution to these problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=960.098s">Because</a> I think the council is speaking up each and every week on behalf of the taxpayers, but the mayor is the one and the only one that can resolve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=966.661s">He</a> signed the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=968.041s">This</a> is his ballgame. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=969.442s">Thank</a> you, councilor.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1358.197s">Lachey</a> Senescar, number 5.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1782.544s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1997.252s">Alan,</a> you indicated that you've done a host of issues as it relates to hopefully remediating the noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2009.032s">at</a> that particular point. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2011.514s">My</a> question to you is this, as I'm talking, I'm looking for your email. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2016.557s">I</a> believe that you sent to one of the residents as it relates to noise being loud enough or disturbing enough that you folks would be offering space in your hospital for her to run her business. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2034.878s">What's</a> the difference between that time till now if the noise issue is still the same?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2210.897s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2212.298s">Mr.</a> President, through you to the chair, I have a letter here dated September 6, 2013, for which you addressed to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2221.682s">And</a> in that letter, you addressed two particular issues, one regarding the positive effects if, in fact, the Lawrence Memorial Hospital does go in effect into a merger. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2229.706s">And</a> then you have an unending paragraph. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2231.467s">It</a> says, on a second matter, which is about the noise emitted into the neighborhood from the Lawrence Memorial Hospital, we have contracted with a firm to install covers over the air intakes at LMH. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2242.212s">The</a> installation is scheduled for next Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2244.213s">It</a> should reduce the sound a great deal, and we hope it will provide relief to the neighbors needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2251.067s">So</a> there is an acknowledgment dating back to 2013 that the hospital acknowledges that there's an issue of noise in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2259.433s">Now,</a> if the state is coming in or the city is coming in, and maybe they're not there on a 24-hour basis, they may be just coming in there and putting up one of those ear monitor machines and seeing if they hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2272.681s">I</a> personally was in the hospital in a doctor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2276.235s">that</a> faces the Lawrence Road side. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2279.998s">And</a> I could hear it in the doctor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2282.22s">Was</a> it consistent? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2283.3s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2283.841s">But</a> it did run in intermittent periods of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2286.763s">Now,</a> I believe it was some two to three weeks ago, the resident, Mrs. Casey, appeared before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2292.327s">And</a> I believe, and I could be wrong because I know she's sitting there, she had what she had, what I believe, which is an independent contractor who would be willing to come in and service, I believe it was a $400 or $500 fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2306.352s">I</a> could be reading this wrong, but my impression was that I believe that she would accept and hopefully the hospital would accept whatever the findings might be that would make resolution to the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2316.938s">And</a> Mrs. Casey is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2319.619s">She</a> can speak for herself, but I think that's the way I understood it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2323.902s">And</a> that should not be at her cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2326.603s">It</a> should be at the hospital's cost because the track record exists that you folks at the hospital before you became CEO, and I wish you good luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2334.301s">Um,</a> but more importantly, you know, the neighborhood right now is an issue and it's, it'll always be an issue as long as that hospital is there.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2377.947s">The</a> only difference is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2379.687s">You</a> make a lot more money than we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2381.528s">That's</a> the difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2383.248s">So</a> you have to do a good job to stay in your position. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2386.669s">The</a> people can throw us out at any time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2389.029s">But</a> you're stuck there with a good salary.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2444.607s">Your</a> own e-mails acknowledge the fact that a noise problem did exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2448.249s">And</a> however they've been resolved, mitigated or whatever they might be, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2452.292s">But</a> can we have Mrs. Casey just answer that question? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2455.294s">I</a> think this will resolve the whole problem.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2458.576s">Sure.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2500.599s">Nobody's</a> saying that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2501.26s">I</a> just, just want this problem resolved and to go away. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2505.782s">So</a> could we just, can we have Mrs. Casey just answer that question?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2713.408s">Well,</a> I don't think it's that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2714.288s">I</a> think it's just getting to a final resolution and maybe this outside independent of both of you can bring <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2720.088s">resolution</a> to the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2721.289s">And</a> I think she would be willing to accept it as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2723.51s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3254.427s">Alan,</a> one of the things that came out of the report from the new Attorney General Maury Healy was not only the concern of maybe lack of competition, but I believe that there were 50 other medical <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3270.077s">senior</a> people, doctors in hospitals, who indicated that there was no belief that those prices were going to go down. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3276.879s">And</a> I think that was one of the major issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3279.66s">Another</a> concern, if I understood it correctly, is the fact that even if this merger is or were to have taken place, the guarantee that the Lawrence Memorial Hospital would become part of the Mass General or the Partners Group did not have a beginning date. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3296.525s">They</a> had that five-year window, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3300.48s">And</a> I think one of the concerns, because in my letter that I addressed to both attorney generals and to the judge, is that if this were to take place, I think that the licensure should become operative immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3314.527s">So</a> that way the city of Medford knows that the Lawrence Memorial Hospital is not in a holding patent, and we're not going to be just shuffled around. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3322.323s">so</a> to speak, because I'll speak for myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3324.924s">My</a> opinion is the Melrose-Wakefield right now seems to have gotten the bigger bite of the apple of what could possibly be had here for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3332.708s">So</a> I don't think the Lawrence Memorial is out of the ballgame at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3336.21s">I</a> think it's still in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3337.67s">But</a> I would strongly, and I would write it again, and I would repeat my letter to whoever the attorney or the judge might be, that the Medford licensure for the Lawrence Memorial Hospital has to become an immediate decision <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3352.127s">Uh,</a> not a decision breaker, an immediate decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3354.929s">So</a> the patients, the administration, the doctors, everybody knows that this hospital is alive and well, and it's not on a holding patent because that was the one thing that you did not read in the decision that was, that was rented by Martha Coakley. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3370.118s">That</a> licensure was not in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3372.319s">And</a> I know Maura Healy has a different, a different position on that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3453.884s">My</a> apologies, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3455.165s">Judge</a> Saunders, in her written opinion, was very specific as it related to the cost containment not being able to be proven by partners, and also, I believe, the competition that the cost containment <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3470.786s">could</a> not prove that it would be able to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3473.188s">I</a> think in the decision that was rendered by the Attorney General, the first one, Coakley, I believe there was a five or a six year gap in there or a window that they said that they wouldn't raise rates.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3490.88s">And</a> I think when Maura Healey, the new Attorney General, was looking for something that would be more of an establishment, that it would be well recognized and it could be amortized out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3499.146s">And</a> I think that was one of the things that was <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3502.103s">That</a> was deficient in the report that Martha Coakley, the original Attorney General, who rendered her opinion on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3510.666s">But</a> the licensure issue is the key.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3519.689s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3520.809s">And</a> I think whatever your negotiations might be right now with partners, I think that should probably be premier right on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3527.432s">We'd</a> like to be a party of this, but we have to have an understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3532.088s">that</a> we have doctors that are well-respected in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3534.99s">You</a> know, we don't want them to leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3536.191s">We</a> certainly don't want the citizens of Medford to leave the Lawrence Memorial Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3540.013s">And</a> for whatever and however, it's going to be left as an established hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3543.535s">But</a> if we don't have our license or our licensure, however you want to term it, in hand, then we have to wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3549.999s">That's</a> just going to prompt these people to leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3551.781s">It's</a> going to prompt your nurses to say, hey, wait a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3554.582s">Where</a> am I going to go?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4313.768s">I</a> know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4314.609s">On</a> that issue with the bushes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4315.87s">There</a> was an agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4317.211s">No,</a> no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4317.871s">The</a> unfortunate part about that, the folks at the nursing home cut the bushes down by mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4322.535s">I</a> understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4323.736s">Or</a> whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4324.777s">And</a> it was at the behest of the residents that forced the issue for which <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4329.788s">the</a> hospital, the nursing home, had to put the bushes back. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4332.509s">So</a> no fault of the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4334.069s">I</a> didn't say that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4337.63s">Well,</a> you indicated through a mutual agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4339.73s">There</a> was no mutual agreement.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4348.192s">But</a> you just said now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4349.313s">We</a> made our point of clarification.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4392.166s">Point</a> of information, Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4393.427s">I</a> believe it was this council that made a request that have either Maura Healy or someone from her office attend a city council meeting to explain that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4401.509s">And</a> I believe also a request to have someone from the hospital to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4405.33s">I</a> don't want to be that presumptuous to say to go ahead and support it because the new plan may not be advantageous to the Lawrence Memorial Hospital.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4579.409s">Uh,</a> and amendment, uh, request from Councilor Penta that the, uh, emotion also be amended to, to read that the, uh, Medford city council supports an immediate licensure approval for the Lawrence Memorial hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4591.159s">Uh,</a> how do we say it? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4593.321s">You</a> know what I'm trying to say rather than having it approved and you have five years to work within it, that the license is effective for the hospital immediately to become interactive with the, um, uh, partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4603.87s">Um,</a> what would the proper terminal? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4605.332s">Oh,</a> that, uh, that,
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4822.144s">The</a> chair recognizes Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4825.105s">Number</a> 2B, the lighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4827.126s">Can</a> you explain where is this lighting going to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4830.708s">Please</a> state your name and address for the record, sir.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4867.19s">Just</a> on that issue right there, you're going to have that shooting off the building or are these going to be individual stanchions shooting down?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4898.842s">So</a> through the chair, if you're saying that you're going to shut the lights off at X amount of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4902.504s">No,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4903.164s">We</a> didn't say we're going to shut the lights off. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4905.951s">Well,</a> I thought the whole idea was to give you the... Go ahead.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4919.394s">That's</a> inside the building, I'm talking about outside.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4922.955s">So</a> then how does that complete the purpose, as Councilor Marks alluded to in the beginning, of people just coming in there and wanting to hang around, because they're going to see the lights on outside.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5954.383s">Um,</a> I'm just a little bit perplexed on, on the motion to be honest with you, because we are now asking to get ourselves involved in a private institutions <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5967.835s">right</a> to do whatever they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5969.275s">And</a> the social justice part of it, for which I understand, is very compelling, not knowing whether the jobs are going to be here or the jobs are not going to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5979.178s">But</a> I've never seen the Medford City Council make the same argument for employees within this building, whether they're going to get laid off or not going to get laid off. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5990.141s">And</a> this is not within our purview. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5992.702s">If</a> you're looking for a vote that basically says it's not right, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5997.738s">I've</a> never seen Tufts University come down to this podium and tell us what to do and how to run our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6003.564s">It's</a> not their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6004.765s">It's</a> not our job to be telling them what to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6007.448s">Do</a> we feel bad about it? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6008.729s">Sure</a> we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6010.351s">But</a> I don't think this belongs within the realm of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6014.695s">If</a> the council individually wants to take it upon themselves and write a letter, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6018.945s">to</a> the school and indicate to the school, to the new president, Barbara Rubell, the public relations lady, that we don't think this is right, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6028.529s">But</a> the fact of the matter is, they are a private institution. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6032.49s">They</a> don't come under any control of this Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6036.032s">And</a> for us to go out of our way to try to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6039.907s">You</a> know, I would hope that they would save whatever their jobs might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6044.628s">So</a> be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6045.108s">But</a> I don't see them coming down here and telling us how to run our government. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6050.37s">Mrs.</a> Beatrice just came up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6051.71s">I</a> don't see them coming down here and telling her how to invest those monies that she has a responsibility and the trust fund for. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6058.532s">I</a> don't see that happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6061.933s">I</a> just think we're going into a territory that's, you know, as far as I'm concerned, it's never been charted before. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6068.395s">I</a> just don't think that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6069.964s">It's</a> going to serve any purpose, other than the fact of Tufts University, they get a resolution from the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6076.988s">Well,</a> I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6077.589s">Is</a> it Somerville City Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6079.03s">Are</a> they doing the same thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6080.05s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6080.37s">April</a> 9th. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6083.432s">With</a> that being said, Mr. President, I just don't think we're going in the right direction on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6088.756s">And</a> while I feel bad, and I don't know whether the jobs are going to be cut or not, I mean, if they're having such a large expansion, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6096.404s">Common</a> sense would tell me if they're going to be expanding more of their footprint, why would they be laying off rather than not hiring more to take care of the buildings of their new footprint? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6105.448s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6106.708s">And</a> with that being said, I just can't support this right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6112.131s">I</a> don't think we have everything in front of us that we really need for the facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6116.492s">I</a> think it's emotional right now as it stands, and I can understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6120.354s">But</a> if you're spending all this kind of money for all this expansion, which is in the multi-millions of dollars, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6126.078s">Well,</a> I mean, why should they even be considered to be losing their jobs? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6129.1s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6129.921s">Maybe</a> we should have somebody from Tufts University come down here and explain it to us, and then maybe the vote will have more of a substance rather than the emotion that it's going to have right now at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6140.57s">Mr.</a> President?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6954.263s">Mr.</a> President, I'm looking at the recommendation, and I will admit that it does have merit. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6959.725s">There's</a> a word in here that I didn't realize was in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6962.246s">I</a> was reading it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6963.047s">Maybe</a> I read it wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6965.192s">I</a> have no problem saying that Medford City Council respectfully recommends, because I think that has a different tone to it, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6972.794s">And</a> the word reassess is not telling them exactly to do it, but I think it's implied. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6977.275s">So</a> with that being said, and I agree with Councilor Marks, you know, I think this is, it's a good resolution, because again, like I said, I don't think we're out to hurt anybody, but the fact of the matter is, you know, we have to look at our own building, what goes on in this entire building here between and amongst ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6993.448s">We</a> have positions that are understaffed and we have positions maybe that are overstaffed, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6998.99s">But</a> as far as that goes, I would like to, after the word Medford City Council, put the word respectfully recommends. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7006.813s">Because</a> usually that's what a Medford City Council resolution does. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7009.334s">They</a> respectfully recommend.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7187.465s">Mr.</a> President, it's another wonderful Medford business person who, through the years, has helped so many individuals in this community make sure they got their tickets to enjoy sporting and community and family events, whether they be at the Boston Garden or other locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7203.978s">So</a> I just think it would be a nice way to say hello, give them a recommendation, and a happy birthday. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7209.122s">The</a> President Great guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7210.323s">And</a> thank you for that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8184.951s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8185.852s">Um,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8186.732s">Counsel</a> Lingo, because I, I, it does, it touches everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8189.594s">Uh,</a> this past Friday, a good friend of the family, 25 years old in New Hampshire doesn't make any difference where it comes from. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8196.617s">Died</a> of an overdose. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8198.298s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8199.118s">It's,</a> it's, it's, it's a sad situation, but I just like to travel back in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8203.881s">And</a> if you remember when we had this mini epidemic that was going on in the schools and the elementary grade, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8210.67s">with</a> the stamps. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8211.971s">Remember</a> when they were licking the stamps and there was drugs in the stamps and the kids got hooked on it? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8217.855s">I</a> think you may have been on the school committee at the time, Councilman LSD, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8222.398s">And</a> they were giving it to the kids for nothing back then to get them hooked on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8226.34s">And</a> that's just so such a, it was a sad state of affairs back then. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8231.063s">And</a> I think parents and the schools, everybody got involved with it and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8236.118s">When</a> you talk about education, Councilor Lingo, I think every teacher, from kindergarten all the way up, needs to be educated on this particular subject matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8245.423s">It's</a> an educational course that's not English or history or social studies. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8249.805s">It's</a> an educational course of everyday life that's taking place in their classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8255.108s">And</a> the child, other than having their parents at home, it's the teacher in the classroom that probably has them more at a confined time and period <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8263.685s">than</a> any other time in their life as they're growing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8266.968s">And</a> the teachers need to recognize all the shortcomings. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8270.29s">Now,</a> the fact of the matter is, and I don't know, somebody out there mentioned the fact about, you know, the criminal aspect of it, and it's true. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8277.136s">There</a> needs to be, that component has to be attacked just as well because there has to be something that destroys the idea of having a seller give these drugs out or kids get themselves addicted to it and what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8292.158s">I</a> believe that there's a law out there right now that says if you have any kind of a drug or you sell it within 1,000 feet or is it 500 feet of a school, it's a mandatory two or three years, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8303.787s">You</a> know, there's been proponents for years going up on Beacon Hill saying that anyone who gets caught selling drugs to a student should have a mandatory five-year sentence. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8311.493s">Then</a> there was some as high as 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8313.894s">Whether</a> that's the issue to stop it or not, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8316.176s">But</a> the fact of the matter is that they're out there selling it, and there are more people using <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8320.785s">harrowing</a> now than ever before. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8322.325s">And</a> I think that day, it couldn't have been any more telling when that lady stood up there at that vigil and told us that she didn't lose one, but she lost two sons. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8330.267s">And</a> she lost a second son after he was four years clean. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8334.968s">This</a> is — it just doesn't go away. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8337.249s">And</a> it's something that a parent has to live with, day in and day out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8341.41s">We're</a> all around this rail subject to — whether it's our own kids, our grandkids, or relatives within our family, or friends outside the family. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8348.792s">You</a> know, it's out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8350.56s">And</a> I think the police department, whether it's local, state, or federal, they have a big job in their hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8355.464s">And</a> what they need to do, and what the judges need to do, they need to step up to the plateau. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8359.887s">Instead</a> of giving them a slap on the wrist, or giving them suspended sentences, they need to send them away and do their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8366.333s">And</a> maybe they should build the jails in Wellesley, and Newton, and Lexington, and the high-priced towns where a lot of these people are doing the selling, and that's where they're coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8374.759s">It</a> affects every single body, and every single life, and every single community, rich, poor, and indifferent. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8379.915s">So</a> I thank you, Councilor Langel. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8381.476s">But</a> you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8382.057s">You</a> know what I'd like to have you do? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8383.358s">I'd</a> like to put an amendment on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8384.659s">I'd</a> like to have you have the superintendent of schools report back to this council, and I'd like to have you give him a time period that what he is doing within his school system with his teachers, so we all have an idea as to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8398.55s">And</a> I think that puts the pressure on that, hey, if you're really serious about addressing this thing within our school system, because this council is serious about it, because we've all affected it, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8408.323s">We've</a> all been affected by a loss by someone, immediate or otherwise, then we're doing something about it, and we want to see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8415.788s">We</a> want to see it in the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8417.41s">We</a> want to see it in the budget of the school department, and we want to have it come and televised and publicized to every single taxpayer in this community what they should be on the lookout for, because the school department's going to do it, and the parents should be apprised of it as well.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8591.365s">And</a> as, strike that, have it amended that the superintendent respond back as <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8603.702s">to</a> what his plan is for each and every one of the teachers in the school system.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8620.795s">Yeah,</a> prevention.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8665.649s">On</a> that particular resolution, can we also have a copy of that resolution sent to the governor's opiate, I can't think of the exact title of his commission, because what they're looking for is input from cities and towns as it relates to their concerns as it relates to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8682.355s">I</a> don't know the exact <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8684.037s">name</a> of the commission, but he has a commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8689.338s">It's</a> the Opium Addition Tax Force, because if we could send a copy of that to them and keep them apprised.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8707.467s">No,</a> no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8707.907s">He's</a> just a co-chairman of a committee, but I don't know what he's doing.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8713.491s">No,</a> no, I'm not on that committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8714.571s">Are</a> you on that committee, Councilor Penter? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8715.612s">Not</a> on that committee, no.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8721.756s">Well,</a> when he gave that comment at the vigil, I think they said they were- Did he dispose of the matter already? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8726.298s">He</a> said he was working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8727.399s">I</a> don't know what he's doing.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9243.72s">The</a> card and shelf, this is probably, I think, maybe the 14th time that this council has addressed this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9250.243s">And</a> I just don't know why the mayor just doesn't want to listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9253.004s">Four</a> months now, I mean, four weeks now into downtown Medford Square, and again, the lights are out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9258.507s">And</a> you can go to all the squares, and it's epidemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9262.229s">You</a> know, National Grid, which has the lights for the city of Medford, used to have a gentleman at nighttime drive around the city, and he would identify all the lights that were out, and they would be repaired. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9271.618s">Now,</a> that stopped some time ago, and since that stopped, the city of Medford has done nothing to pick up the slack as it relates to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9278.0s">I</a> mean, you have to be blind not to realize, when you're driving through Medford Square right now, that there are eight lights out between CVS and going toward the banks and into the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9289.544s">You</a> know, public safety is a big thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9291.344s">If</a> you have to ask the chief of police, as I said today, what is your biggest public safety concern as it relates to breaking and entering? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9298.087s">And</a> he said, it's lighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9299.826s">And</a> in downtown Medford, you go to Haines Square, you go to West Medford, you go to North Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9304.327s">These</a> lights are just out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9305.387s">So</a> I don't know what it's going to take for the mayor to realize that he has a responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9310.528s">He's</a> got to come out of that corner office that he hides in all day long, and he doesn't want to see what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9316.909s">He</a> needs to see what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9318.15s">This</a> is a public safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9320.01s">It's</a> going on each and every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9321.51s">This</a> is four weeks running now that those lights are out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9324.791s">And</a> there's no excuse to say that we don't have personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9327.712s">From</a> my understanding, they just got through hiring <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9329.674s">a</a> new gentleman that's going to be in charge of the electrical department, a former Metro resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9334.335s">So</a> with that being said, it isn't like they don't have anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9337.416s">They</a> don't have the personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9339.076s">And</a> if they need to stagger a person for one day a week at nighttime to drive around to identify the lights that are out and then go out and correct them during the day, then just do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9348.698s">National</a> Grid is not doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9351.099s">We</a> need to do it, again. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9353.057s">This</a> is leadership that is so broken and fallen apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9356.139s">I</a> have no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9357.479s">I</a> have absolutely no idea what's going on and how this city runs on so many of these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9363.062s">But</a> this is a public safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9365.003s">You</a> can speak to the chief of police and every police officer will tell you the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9368.685s">Once</a> those lights go out and as the lights continue to go out, it does present a public safety to a public person walking, driving, and to the value and to the safety of the store. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9381.825s">that</a> these lights are supposedly on there to shine on and to protect people's business investments here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9389.708s">It's</a> bad enough you go down residential streets and some of the lights are out, but when they're in the downtown business working area and the lights are out, you have now multiplied that problem for an incident of crime to take place or an accident to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9403.714s">So</a> that being said, Madam President, I move that the Medford City Council on a roll call vote tell the mayor to <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9410.395s">get</a> these lights on immediately in the interest of public safety.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9861.755s">Real</a> quick, even though, and I appreciate the remarks as it relates to the Route 16, equally as important is the lighting in the downtown area, especially downtown Medford with these lights out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9870.6s">So,</a> you know, these resolutions just don't go on the agenda lightly as all of us do, because, you know, we're believing we're doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9878.624s">But</a> if we can't get our responses, and that's why I said last week, we have a resolution on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9883.046s">I</a> hope the city clerk has upgraded his thing and he inserted the 10-day slot, because that'll really tell us where we're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9889.939s">on</a> a lot of these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9890.86s">We</a> still haven't gotten a response back from upstairs on the MS4, which is right around the corner, which is going to be a big cost to the city if, in fact, we have to follow the EPA guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9900.445s">We</a> haven't gotten anything regarding, you know, our street recovery program. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9903.287s">We</a> could just go on and on and on and a whole bunch of issues, but he's just not responding to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9907.69s">Maybe</a> because he feels that the council is not bothering him, he's not going to respond to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9912.533s">So</a> if that be the case, then maybe what we need to do after Mr. Finn puts that 10-day period in, we just put it on here and we override his veto. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9920.659s">And</a> then from there, it just becomes law. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9923.221s">If</a> I understand the way the rules go, if he doesn't respond within 10 days, it becomes operative. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9928.405s">Is</a> that correct, Mr. Finn? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9933.368s">If</a> he does not respond in 10 days, 10 business working days, the resolution asked becomes operative. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9941.146s">And</a> if he sends it back with a no, we take a two-thirds vote and override the veto. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9945.548s">And</a> if we override the veto, then we figure out what needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9949.11s">And</a> if he wants to challenge this charter as the charter is written, well, then let it begin now because this is really becoming totally unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9957.654s">These</a> resolutions aren't even for ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9960.215s">These</a> are for the taxpayers of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9962.136s">They</a> pay taxes for what we're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9966.429s">And</a> that man over there in the corner who wants to play King Solomon, he can't understand what's going on.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9979.013s">Roll</a> call vote, Madam President, and send it to the mayor.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10031.792s">Madam</a> President, once again today, as late as today, I have pictures here, right here on the infamous ring road. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10038.493s">Then</a> we have, I think it's Benton Street and South Metro, right down the street from you, Councilor Dello Russo, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10044.975s">And</a> then we also have, I had a 42-minute conversation with our chief of police tonight as he relates to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10051.096s">I</a> told him, chief, the resolution's on there, you know what it's saying, you know what it's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10055.178s">I</a> have tickets here that people continuously keep giving me, telling me that they're collecting monies from the meters that they're not supposed to be collecting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10061.584s">If</a> you read the contract, the contract tells you how these vehicles are supposed to be addressed and highlighted. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10068.469s">I</a> know Councilor Dello Russo is calling for a meeting, I believe it's Wednesday the 22nd, I believe, or the 23rd, whatever it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10075.716s">And</a> we're going to have the people from Republic, the Chief of Police, and I believe it's the Traffic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10083.68s">And</a> as the council has asked, Mr. Finn, we've asked prior to that meeting to have a list of all the resolutions that the traffic commission has and is voted upon and what's still outstanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10095.204s">And</a> one of the things that outstanding Councilor Marks is I asked the chief about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10098.785s">Um,</a> I believe that your resolution regarding the 15 minute, um, grace period, I believe today, I, a lady got out of her car in Medford square and she, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10109.612s">walked</a> to the kiosk, and while she walked to the kiosk, the guy from Republic, the bounty hunter from Republic came over, and he gave her a ticket, which is absolutely crazy, because think of this logically, anybody who's out there watching, you go to Bedford Square, you park, and if you're five or six car lengths removed from the kiosk, by the time you go to the kiosk and walk back, how are you supposed to do what you're supposed to do, and the guy is going out there giving these tickets, and today he's holding this handheld thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10137.764s">It's</a> not right, it doesn't make any sense, and it's absolutely not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10141.387s">But</a> the real good issue is going to come in two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10144.85s">Now</a> just think, what's going to happen here in two weeks? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10146.691s">Does</a> anybody know? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10148.632s">We're</a> going to have a carnival, aren't we? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10150.494s">And</a> the carnival is going to be taking up all the parking spaces here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10155.057s">So</a> all these wonderful people who are going to bring their kids and think they're going to go to a carnival and not worry about the parking are going to go park in that parking lot over there with those stupid, stupid little <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10165.152s">kiosks</a> or against the building for which nobody can see at the end of the day, and the tickets are going to be galore. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10171.355s">And</a> then you're going to really see, you're really going to see the people getting upset about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10175.658s">And</a> the police department, because they're not going to want to handle it because it's not in their bailiwick, because that's what they agreed upon by a union vote, not to be involved, to get involved, but anything to do with the ticketing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10186.404s">And</a> unfortunately for this chief of police, for which this wonderful mayor has saddled him with the responsibility of resolving all these problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10194.461s">Well,</a> as I said before, and I said to the chief, unfortunately, this is not your job. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10198.803s">You</a> should be doing police work, not parking work. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10201.425s">The</a> parking work should be done by the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10203.546s">And</a> to have him indicate and say that he's never received a complaint, he's absolutely, I don't know what he's drinking or smoking, but he's on something, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10213.131s">We</a> heard a lady here come up here tonight and tell you from her beauty parlor that she not only wrote him, but she called him. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10220.705s">We</a> had last week, and I have the letter here, from Mystic Valley, the thing for pediatrics. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10229.127s">We</a> got the doctor, we got the employees, and we have people who are seniors who were there, gave the names of the individuals who didn't even know how to use, never mind the kiosk, but getting tagged. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10240.19s">People</a> who have handicapped placards getting tagged. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10246.301s">I</a> spoke to a lady that went to Here's Karen in West Medford during the second storm, the third storm, excuse me, an elderly woman whose daughter was driving her to Here's Karen. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10257.71s">She</a> gets getting out of the car and the Republic guy comes up to her, tells her to hurry up and move the car or you're going to get a ticket while the lady's walking into the store. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10266.277s">Now</a> that's not what you call good business. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10269.699s">And</a> then when you go in all the parking lots, the signs that say two hour parking is still up, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10274.749s">And</a> they're still giving out tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10276.41s">It's</a> supposed to be three-hour parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10279.091s">So</a> we're right back to where we went right from the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10282.692s">The</a> contract was signed October 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10285.193s">I</a> don't even think there's been any human relations interaction between any of these people that work for National Republic and the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10293.776s">I</a> mean, pardon me? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10296.615s">They're</a> ambassadors. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10297.375s">I</a> don't know what they're, yeah, you know, they're ambassadors for bounty hunters. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10300.876s">That's</a> what they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10301.597s">So</a> with that being said, Madam President, I just really think, and I know we're going to have a meeting on the, I think it's the 23rd, but the contract, the violations just keep continuing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10313.081s">The</a> pictures don't lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10314.721s">And</a> I think today, I think we all got, or at least I got an email from folks on Frederick Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10320.342s">who</a> have legitimate parking permits to be parked there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10324.626s">They</a> got tagged yesterday and today. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10326.588s">So</a> where does this begin and where does this begin and end? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10329.811s">It's</a> obvious the republic doesn't know their job or the people that are working for them don't know the territory of their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10336.198s">They're</a> giving out tickets indiscriminately. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10337.88s">Last</a> week, I believe the chief had to go up to Boston Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10340.669s">and</a> resolve tickets for business people up there who are legitimately parked in a 30-minute parking zone, in a loading zone, delivering, making a delivery, and emptying stuff out of their car. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10354.957s">And</a> the response from the Republic, if you don't like it, appeal it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10358.018s">Well,</a> that's not the way it's supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10359.979s">They</a> should go and do their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10362.281s">Madam</a> President, I would hope when the Chief comes in two weeks, and the Traffic Commission comes in two weeks, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10368.625s">Mr.</a> Nash, and whoever he wants to come from in two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10372.227s">It's</a> obvious, all these things need to get resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10374.768s">But</a> Councilor Marks, you came up with a good idea, I think it was a couple of weeks ago, or maybe it was last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10379.691s">For</a> those people who have paid, let's find out how great this electronic system is that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10386.314s">If</a> I paid before eight, and I paid after six, they should have a listing of all of that, because my number plate was supposed to be tied into that system. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10394.979s">And</a> if we all remember correctly, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10396.877s">And</a> I think I do, because the records will reflect. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10399.417s">I</a> think that they said that they keep the records in that machine either for six weeks, if not eight weeks, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10405.619s">And</a> if they keep them in there, pardon me? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10408.079s">No,</a> they don't purge them, they keep them for six, they have to keep them for the appeal period. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10411.28s">They</a> have to keep them for at least the appeal period. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10412.74s">So</a> I think it, yeah, the tickets, okay, in the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10415.38s">So</a> with that being said, I think there should be no reason not to find out, Councilor Marks, there should be no reason not to find out how many people <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10423.778s">and</a> how much money that they took. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10425.498s">That's</a> illegally, they illegally, that's, you know, that's a meat of robbery, if that's what you want to call it, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10431.359s">And</a> that's perpetrating a fraud. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10432.64s">And</a> you know who's getting rich out of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10434.8s">Not</a> only that, the mayor, he's making money on this because it goes to the end of the bottom line. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10439.341s">But</a> it's not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10440.701s">It's</a> bad enough you're taxing the people to death, and now you have this new McGlynn tax that's every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10446.622s">Don't</a> take money that shouldn't be taken.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10879.025s">Real</a> quick, Rick, I'm going to go back to December 23rd of this past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10883.728s">Your</a> resolution, the mayor hasn't even acknowledged it, and you even gave him a grace period. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10887.15s">Your</a> resolution, as it relates to 14-795, basically says, and that we had 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, we had almost 11 people speak that night, amended by Councilor Caraviello, that a 60-day evaluation take place with the mayor and republic with the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10901.06s">And</a> we gave the grace period to begin when it became operative in January 15th, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10906.009s">This</a> is now April 7th. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10907.73s">Never</a> mind not having any meeting, we've got no financials. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10910.672s">So</a> this is what I would like to do in preparation for our meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10913.813s">Since</a> we haven't had our 60-day meeting, I would like to amend and have the council go on record that effective immediately that we meet with the council every 30 days for the purposes of going over its finances and all the complaints and the concerns that we have until this thing gets itself resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10931.923s">Because</a> we're going to be meeting with the traffic commission, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10935.118s">And</a> that's just going to be a one-shot deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10937.379s">And</a> if we can't get them to give us a response after 60 days, and if we follow what you're saying, Councilor Marks, and we now go 30 days after that, forget it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10945.224s">How</a> much more time do you want to give them to get their act together?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10951.748s">The</a> 23rd, Wednesday.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10961.174s">I</a> want to have this resolved before we did once again <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10963.803s">to</a> the concerns that were going to take place on the meeting of the 23rd.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10974.488s">Is</a> it the 23rd or the 22nd, Eddie?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10978.549s">22nd.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10988.133s">Just</a> before we do that, Madam President, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10990.155s">Again,</a> with all these pictures that are there, and the chief knows about it, he's aware about it, he's instructed Republic on more than one occasion to do it, and they haven't done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10999.158s">And</a> once again, I'm just publicly saying to the chief and any police officer out there, you see these cars, tag them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11004.139s">Tag</a> them and tow them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11005.06s">Get</a> them off the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11006.0s">Because</a> you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11007.04s">If</a> a poor guy drives down the street and he doesn't have a sticker on his windshield because he wasn't inspected, that's a $50 fine, and he has the right to have his car impounded. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11014.782s">The</a> same thing without having a registration. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11016.965s">These</a> guys have been around since January. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11019.065s">And</a> from January till now, they still haven't gotten their act together, especially with their vehicles that they go out and they try to enforce the rules that they can't even have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11027.387s">They</a> try to enforce rules that they won't obey, but they want other people to obey. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11031.108s">It's</a> just not right, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11032.749s">That's</a> what happens when you go out of town and you get out-of-towners. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11035.849s">And</a> these people are bounty hunters, and they probably have quotas, and they're going to do everything they can now to make life miserable, to make up for what they lost during the storms.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11070.947s">It's</a> a violation of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11074.008s">They've</a> done it since January.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11076.469s">But</a> my question is, the police aren't the enforcing authority on city contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11081.331s">The</a> Registry of Motor Vehicles has a site and section that says if you make frequent stops, you have to have that on the back of your vehicle that says <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11091.452s">This</a> vehicle makes frequent stops.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11093.313s">And</a> they have not done that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11094.733s">All</a> they have is those stupid flashing yellow lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11096.974s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11097.254s">That's</a> my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11097.954s">I</a> didn't know what was actually wrong with the vehicles, because I still haven't seen them, to be honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11102.575s">You're</a> not going to see them if you don't have them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11104.096s">I</a> see the pictures every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11105.336s">That's</a> it.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11116.239s">Madam</a> President, can we allow suspension of the rules to allow a citizen to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11122.723s">Name</a> and address for the record.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11292.86s">One</a> of the things I think it's kind of like really enlightening to read is the action that's taking place against the city of Lynn where the prosecution really, the prosecutorial process has really gone in depth as it relates to the finances that took place in the city of Lynn that were just not being justified and accountable for. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11316.513s">And</a> we have been asking for a long period of time over here <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11320.748s">the</a> former people that worked for Channel 3 to submit their finances, and it started back at Mark Rumley, when they call it the Rumley Report, and then when we had Judge Thompson, and now we're here, and nothing's taking place, you know, and the mayor owes it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11338.685s">The</a> mayor owes it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11339.852s">to</a> every single TV subscriber. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11341.173s">He</a> owes it to this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11342.273s">We</a> keep talking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11343.754s">He's</a> sitting on $300,000 of subscribers' monies with absolutely no accounting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11349.376s">And</a> this is what precipitated the lawsuit in Lynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11352.397s">And</a> this is how they're all getting sued individually for whatever it might be worth. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11356.358s">Lynn</a> is one of eight communities that, unfortunately, the public access channels just apparently ran amok because nobody was watching over them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11365.802s">Just</a> like this city here, nobody watching over them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11368.603s">And</a> when the voluntary dissolution supposedly took place, I think it was October of 2013 to now, and they said that they were going to submit all these papers, and the Attorney General blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and is just out there in limbo. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11382.071s">But</a> this new Attorney General, Mara Healy, she must mean action. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11386.592s">Well,</a> big difference for Martha Coakley, because this one here at least does something whether you like it or you don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11391.114s">She</a> gets back to you and she responds. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11393.815s">And</a> their in-depth action against the Lynne Cable television should be the groundwork already being done for the city of Medford just to copy the same thing and go after these culprits who just not has done what they're supposed to have done as it relates to, you know, providing the information, the minutes, the finances, you know, the equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11412.664s">It's</a> just, it's just outrageous. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11414.225s">And</a> for the mayor, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11415.738s">And</a> for the man not to have this public hearing, for which is required by just common sense, I mean, just for transparency, even if you don't want to even do anything but have it and let the people come and talk, what is he afraid of? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11430.567s">I</a> don't understand this man. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11432.309s">I</a> just don't understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11435.27s">He</a> doesn't like the council because he doesn't respond to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11438.292s">He</a> tolerates the school committee because he has to go every other Monday when he has to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11443.216s">He</a> never responds to our resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11446.08s">This</a> is not leadership that works anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11448.081s">It</a> might have worked in the beginning for him, but it's absolutely out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11452.404s">It's</a> lazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11453.165s">It's</a> gone asleep. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11454.166s">It's</a> broken. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11455.266s">And</a> I think he's probably thinking about, you know, maybe these bounty hunters have a better job than him. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11460.71s">And</a> who knows, maybe he's going to go join a company like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11463.712s">I</a> have no idea, but this, this is absolutely not working.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11476.063s">do</a> you want to ask also in that FIOS contract the finances as it relates to it how much we get each quarter and you know how does that work into the whole program no no where are those monies that they come together with Comcast and FIOS you know we can find those resolve motion all those in favor all right all those opposed passes
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11589.949s">If</a> anyone knew Joe Conway, you'd realize he was a consummate person that you would want to be a representative of this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11597.391s">He</a> always smiled. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11598.571s">He</a> was never rude. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11599.831s">He</a> was polite. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11600.871s">He</a> knew his job. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11602.092s">He</a> was friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11602.992s">And</a> at the same time, he did his job like he was supposed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11605.912s">And</a> if you needed a break, he would help you out, making sure that you did what you were supposed to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11610.627s">That's</a> what I remember about Joe. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11612.628s">Always</a> had a smile on his face and was always willing to talk and help out people. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11617.109s">And</a> I think I wish I could say that for everybody in this building, but at least we can say that about Joe.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_bfXSmZAO02E/2025-03-21_bfXSmZAO02E.html">Medford City Council - March 31, 2015  (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=48.15s">Suspension</a> of rules to allow a citizen to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=51.912s">Paper</a> 15-5-329.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=245.934s">One</a> of the concerns that I have after speaking with Mrs. Casey is the fact that she's been constantly wanting to get a communication and a dialogue that would be representative <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=258.731s">of</a> the hospital's interest in the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=261.233s">And</a> I believe the e-mails will prove out that at one point in time when the hospital was coming up for a takeover, so to speak, for which Mara Healy, the new Attorney General, did not allow between the Mass General Partners and the Lawrence Memorial, something went askew right after that, even though she was getting some type of correspondence back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=284.988s">The</a> bad part about the whole story is the fellow that used to be the president, Mr. Michael Sack, took a walk as soon as the deal didn't go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=293.031s">And</a> as soon as that deal didn't go through, he was making all kinds of promises. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=296.232s">We</a> were going to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=297.033s">We</a> were going to investigate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=298.893s">We</a> will have people come out there, spoken to Mrs. Casey and other neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=302.995s">And</a> she's not the only one. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=304.055s">There</a> were other letters that were written to the hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=307.177s">And</a> now it just seems like it's just gone nowhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=310.638s">You</a> know, she's a taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=312.319s">She's</a> a citizen. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=313.473s">You</a> know, and unfortunately, however you want to look at it, there is a problem that does exist over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=318.579s">Now,</a> does it pound 24 hours? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=320.882s">I</a> mean, seven days a week? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=322.123s">No,</a> but when it does come on and when it does happen, it's disturbing, disturbing enough that at times, as a matter of fact, correct me if I'm wrong, you have an email that you received from the hospital that says, <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=332.843s">you</a> could bring your office up to the hospital and work out of the hospital.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=336.804s">So</a> for them to put that in writing and to recognize the fact that the problem exists, it does exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=342.246s">And</a> with that being said, um, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=344.786s">Um,</a> Alan McDonald supposedly is the gentleman supposedly in charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=348.847s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=349.247s">This</a> council hasn't even given me given an update as a result of the merger not taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=354.409s">Unfortunately,</a> um, what seems to be going on over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=357.33s">I</a> mean, I'll just say this too. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=358.873s">as</a> far as the hospital goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=360.374s">Michael</a> Sack did a hell of a job moving everything out of the Lawrence Memorial to the Melrose Wakefield. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=364.877s">That</a> hospital is now in such, I don't even know what kind of a state it is in right now, because a lot of people don't even know what's going on at the hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=372.982s">We</a> as citizens and as Councilors don't even know what the hospital's capable of doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=377.745s">They've</a> reduced their emergency, strike that, they've reduced their intensive care unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=382.391s">They've</a> reduced a lot of the other programs that they had there, and a lot of it's been shipped over, because that's where Michael Sack was going to go if this deal went through, and he was going to be independently of this whole problem, this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=395.338s">She's</a> a resident, she's a taxpayer, and she's been before this council numerous times. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=400.301s">Now,</a> the Lawrence Memorial Hospital needs to be, for $400, I mean, this is incredible. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=404.963s">They</a> don't want to, they're talking about a multi-million dollar merger, and for $400 to keep the neighborhood and the neighbors at bay, in peace? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=412.358s">I</a> mean, what is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=413.319s">So,</a> you know, can we force them to do anything? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=417.103s">No,</a> we can't, but we're here to defend and protect our taxpayer and she's living it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=422.89s">So</a> I would suggest, Mr. President, that we get in touch if it's Alan McDonald, whatever it might be, and hopefully that the council supports the request to spend the $400 <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=432.273s">to</a> have this person of this company come in and do the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=435.994s">I</a> mean, what's $400 when you're talking about hundreds and thousands of dollars? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=439.895s">You're</a> talking about a neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=442.575s">But</a> to say, we're going to give you a room up here, and you can run your business out of our hospital, that to me tells the whole story. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=450.277s">And</a> that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=451.337s">So</a> I would hope that my colleagues would be supportive of the fact that we would make the request that the Lawrence Memorial Hospital honors the request of the taxpayer citizen, employs <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=461.92s">pays</a> the $400, and let's just see where we're going with this thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=464.841s">Because</a> it's obvious, it's a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=466.862s">People</a> don't come to this podium if it's not a problem or to receive some kind of recognition. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=472.385s">It's</a> a neither-or thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=473.265s">And</a> unfortunately, tonight she's here because it's a problem.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3215.536s">Quick</a> question. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3216.777s">Has</a> the drive-through issue been resolved? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3220.678s">Yeah,</a> with the charcoal filter. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3222.133s">No,</a> the drive-thru issue, not the charcoal filter. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3224.415s">There</a> was a drive-thru.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3235.127s">So</a> when was that done? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3236.068s">Because</a> we, I haven't seen the modification. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3239.211s">No,</a> the last time there was anything proposed, it was up to the planning board. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3242.695s">We</a> never saw the final, the final result.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3267.294s">I</a> thought it was either you coming in or coming out on Riverside, but you're exiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3271.215s">No,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3272.196s">We're</a> talking inside the parking lot itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3274.209s">No,</a> I'm talking about them coming in or out off of Riverside Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3278.411s">Are</a> you coming in or off of Riverside Avenue? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3281.213s">Out.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3281.693s">Okay,</a> that I can't speak to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3283.314s">That's</a> something that's a lot of hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3284.235s">Because</a> that was the issue, remember? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3285.015s">You</a> brought up the idea, why can't they go back in between the two buildings if they exit and go down Commercial Street?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3327.454s">Is</a> Riverside Avenue an entrance or an exit?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3334.128s">I'm</a> not going to, I don't want to speak to that for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3336.189s">That's</a> what it wasn't supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3337.41s">I</a> don't, I, I've never, I'm speaking out of information.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3352.738s">Can</a> we get a report back on that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3366.702s">I</a> mean, give us the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3367.982s">They</a> give us the final report.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3420.177s">So</a> all those in favor of a copy of the records, you can get a copy of the records.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3563.318s">So</a> did Councilor Fenton wish to speak question? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3566.881s">You,</a> your hours of operation is 7am to 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3569.203s">Are</a> you coming in for extended hours or not?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4342.191s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4343.592s">Mr.</a> President, <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4345.498s">This</a> seems to be an ongoing saga that, well, it goes back many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4349.919s">But</a> just going back to January of this past year, strike that, January of 2014, we had received a public information bulletin that came out of the offices of Representative Donato and Senator Pat Jalen, indicating that after a long delay, and finally, money being put into the transportation bill, that the work on the aquatic bridge would be taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4374.567s">and</a> the work was expected to begin in the spring of 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4377.729s">That</a> was the press release that came out. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4382.952s">Subsequent</a> to that, and I brought up that same question again earlier this year, there was a subsequent report and a story that came out in our local press that basically, from our director of OCD, who basically said, they know what we're expecting, meaning Department of Transportation, <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4403.374s">We</a> want communication with the people in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4406.937s">And</a> at that point in time, DOT had made the comment of the following that the MassDOT project manager, Paul King, said, construction would take place day and night in order to finish the project in about two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4420.128s">Night</a> shifts will run from 10 or 10.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4423.07s">to</a> 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4423.791s">and</a> day shifts from 6.30 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4425.332s">to</a> 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4426.733s">to</a> 3 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4429.812s">Now,</a> with that being said, and that was the report that just came out January 21st, 2015, a year after the fact, we had discussed this on the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4442.516s">Then</a> there was a letter here dated February 24th, 2015, just about a month after the January notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4450.559s">It</a> says that the project is expected to complete within 1,300 calendar days from the receipt of the notice to proceed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4459.478s">and</a> it states further, I encourage you to take advantage of this opportunity to reacquaint yourself with the project and ask that you share this invitation with the community's emergency service division and any other local officials or departments who may have any interest in this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4476.943s">That</a> was a letter sent out on February 24th. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4480.364s">We</a> never got that letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4482.524s">Mr.</a> President, your name is on the letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4485.365s">You</a> were C.C.'d. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4486.385s">Paul</a> Gere, Cassandra Cugliatos, <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4490.151s">Pat</a> Jalen, Paul Donato, Sean Copley, and Christine Barber. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4494.554s">Five</a> elected officials got this letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4498.076s">And</a> we have yet to see it or hear or discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4501.198s">And</a> something is radically wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4504.059s">Absolutely</a> radically wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4505.46s">I</a> just cannot believe this council had this discussion in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4509.243s">It</a> was reported out. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4510.664s">And</a> then on February 24th, an official letter from DET in Boston with your name and four other elected representatives got this letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4518.75s">indicating</a> that the project is going to be complete within 1,300 calendar days from the receipt of the notice to proceed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4527.914s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4530.895s">1,300</a> calendar days. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4532.136s">There's</a> 365 days in a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4535.277s">That</a> comes out to three years and 56 days, if that's around the clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4541.48s">And</a> if you want to make it around the clock and double it up, it comes out to <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4546.367s">One</a> year and 78 days, for which they won't do, because they've already told you what they're giving you for time schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4553.15s">Mr.</a> President, I don't know why you didn't send it to us or get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4557.771s">You're</a> on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4558.492s">You</a> were CC'd. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4560.232s">City</a> administration was CC'd. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4562.913s">The</a> mayor was addressed to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4565.274s">We</a> haven't received it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4567.795s">Yeah,</a> the start date. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4568.695s">And</a> the start date is as soon as the intent to do, do, do, do. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4574.618s">I</a> will give you a copy of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4578.34s">Here's</a> a copy for yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4579.32s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4581.161s">You're</a> welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4582.801s">I</a> just think that the business community in this city is getting shot change so bad, so bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4590.563s">We</a> as councils have been on top of this issue for months, if not years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4594.465s">This</a> started off as less than a $3 million project, and now they want to build a $13 million Taj Mahal bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4600.446s">It's</a> only nothing more than 121 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4603.427s">And</a> to tie up the business community in this city of Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4607.098s">to</a> tie them up for well in excess of, never mind one year, two years, or three years, whatever it might be, to do what? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4613.863s">What</a> are they building here? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4615.384s">We're</a> not asking for anything outrageous. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4617.766s">Just</a> go in there and take care of the bridge the way it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4620.868s">This</a> isn't the Longfellow Bridge that they're spending millions and millions of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4625.731s">It's</a> a simple little bridge of 121 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4629.614s">And</a> with the technology that's out there today, <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4633.355s">But</a> the technology that's out there today, and to say that it would take at least a year, at least a year if they wanted to even think about changing the conduits for the electric, the telephone, the gas, that's preposterous. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4646.294s">We</a> can go to the moon and back with a simple little phone and you can talk to someone. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4650.649s">You</a> did the FAST-14. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4652.37s">Sure,</a> the bridges were built ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4654.612s">But</a> this isn't a FAST-14. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4655.873s">And</a> if you read the whole thing, and it basically tells you, if you want to acquaint yourself with, what's there to be acquainted with? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4663.54s">Shutting</a> down businesses? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4666.042s">The</a> mayor of this community got this letter on February 24th. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4669.765s">This</a> council discussed it in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4672.508s">The</a> director of OCD said there has to be communication between all parties involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4678.131s">All</a> three things have taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4680.013s">Councilor</a> De La Ruza, whether you got the letter or not, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4682.936s">But</a> five other elected officials got it, and none of us, not one of us, have been informed about this change in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4691.397s">1300</a> calendar days. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4693.278s">Figure</a> it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4694.339s">Around</a> the clock, 24 hours a day, divided by 365, comes up to three years and 56 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4700.422s">And</a> if you want to double up the days and you give them good measure, it comes out to one year and seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4705.945s">It</a> will never happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4706.925s">The</a> cost of the overtime will be a killer for this bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4711.007s">Mr.</a> Mayor, I'm asking you, Mr. President, I'm asking you to call for the Department of Transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4716.63s">The</a> fellow's name is Paul Stedman. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4719.499s">He's</a> the acting district highway director to appear before this council and explain, one, why we were never apprised of the letter and the information enclosed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4731.764s">And</a> I want him to tell the people in this community when, in fact, that bridge construction is going to take place so every single business merchant that might be affected will know about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4742.689s">And</a> also, I don't want to hear the excuse that no mitigation is going to be provided for in this construction period. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4749.101s">Those</a> are his three tasks, those are the three things, Councilor, Mr. President, and I would have hoped that my council colleagues would vote unanimously on a roll call vote and send that to him because this is just completely out of control, out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4763.132s">You</a> have elected people coming in here telling you one thing, having press releases go out. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4767.616s">You</a> have newspaper articles dating back to January of 2014 telling you it's going to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4773.001s">We've</a> been hearing this for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4775.343s">I</a> think it's since 2000. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4776.564s">I</a> think it was you, counsel, a long ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4778.686s">I</a> think I brought it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4779.346s">It</a> was you, 2007. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4781.048s">We</a> talked about the Craddock Bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4783.112s">and</a> you brought up, you just wanted an update as it related to the structure and the safety and the concern of the bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4789.018s">That</a> bridge has been there for well in excess of over 100 plus years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4793.562s">It's</a> sitting on solid granite. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4795.243s">It</a> hasn't sunk. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4796.404s">It</a> doesn't intend to sink. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4798.065s">Why</a> are we building a $13 million edifice? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4801.088s">What</a> all we need is the road to be fixed so people can come and go to work and the business community in downtown does not have to be put aside or put out of business because I think that's exactly what would happen once this bridge closes.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4853.9s">But</a> it was, Mr. Clerk, it was addressed to our Council President, State Senator Jalen, Representative Donato, Representative Garibaldi, and Representative Barber. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4863.067s">And</a> not one of them ever responded to the content of this notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4868.571s">We</a> had our conversation in January on the Council floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4871.252s">It</a> was reported out. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4872.894s">Nothing,</a> nothing like this was reported to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4875.235s">And</a> this came out on February 24th.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4879.5s">if</a> I received his letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4881.48s">You</a> wouldn't receive his letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4882.461s">You're</a> not Fred Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4883.561s">He's</a> Fred Dello Russo.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4891.523s">You</a> call that guy tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4893.643s">You</a> just tell him.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5144.917s">We</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5145.317s">It</a> started at $3 million, went to $13 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5147.739s">Now</a> they're saying it's $10 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5150.221s">Who</a> knows what this bridge is going to look like? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5151.953s">And</a> there was talk of them working 24 hours a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5154.255s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5154.795s">Yeah,</a> absolutely.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5500.951s">Mr.</a> President, I don't know if you were on the council at the time, but it goes back some years ago that the mayor got himself in this <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5507.615s">where</a> I think it was in a December of a particular year. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5511.496s">And</a> as a result of the council resolution coming forward, and I think there was a newspaper story, I don't know what, one of the Boston newspapers, all of a sudden we started getting council resolutions responded to, something like 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5523.82s">Okay,</a> here we have tonight another page with some 20 plus resolutions not being responded to timely. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5530.862s">Ones</a> that I consider to be important are <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5535.814s">We</a> sent a resolution upstairs to our city engineer regarding the MS4 program and what the involvement might be as it relates to the city of Medford, our needs and the cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5547.619s">And</a> I believe I made a notation of a letter that was sent as it related what the EPA was going to be doing and to relate to the charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5555.502s">It</a> was going to be almost like an $800, $900,000 hit to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5559.624s">And</a> it would have been nice if she jumped on board or at least the city of Medford jumped on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5564.796s">for</a> the purposes of saying it would be a nutcracker at the particular time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5568.859s">We've</a> had multiple issues regarding the water and sewer issues here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5572.882s">Also,</a> as it relates to expenditures for programs yet to be decided upon, and sitting on a $7.5 million surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5581.749s">We've</a> constantly have been talking over the past, I think since the mayor decided to bring in the kiosk issues, constantly, again, with the mayor, making no responses other than saying within the purview of the council, <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5593.911s">Well,</a> if all these things are within the purview of the council, then maybe we should just take the action that needs to be taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5598.814s">Also,</a> we had a street revitalization program. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5603.957s">Where's</a> his response to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5605.398s">Where's</a> his response to Councilman Longo's 3-1-1 program? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5608.821s">We've</a> had cable issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5610.762s">The</a> dog park. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5611.522s">Five</a> months. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5613.804s">3-1-1.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5614.004s">3-1-1.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5614.364s">The</a> dog park. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5615.585s">Constantly</a> on the cable issues in this community, where he's sitting on approximately $300 million of taxpayers' money <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5624.073s">strike</a> that, $300,000 of taxpayers' money, of ratepayers' money on cable issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5629.996s">You</a> know, we have asked and we've asked for where is that public hearing on public access, the whole Comcast 10-year contract, which is coming up April 18th, and once again, no response. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5642.483s">And</a> I know that will be coming up at another time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5644.885s">I</a> just think it's terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5647.066s">You</a> know, <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5648.022s">Again,</a> we as a council, we've had our issues between and amongst ourselves, but at least we were able to discuss them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5654.604s">We</a> were able to get them out on the floor and talk on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5657.004s">You</a> vote them up, you vote them down, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5659.205s">This</a> mayor, if it doesn't fit his agenda in any way, he just will not respond. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5664.786s">And</a> I think what happened back then was a motion and a movement for, I think it was a motion of, what was it? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5674.949s">Not</a> non-support. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5677.38s">What</a> the hell was the motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5678.441s">What</a> was the motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5679.101s">Do</a> you remember, Councilman Max? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5681.603s">Because</a> the mayor was refusing to respond to a vote of no confidence. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5685.766s">That's</a> what it was, a vote of no confidence, because he wasn't responding to our council resolutions, which basically, they're not for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5692.871s">They're</a> for the taxpayers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5694.892s">And</a> then all of a sudden, immediately, you saw 25 of them come at you, and everything went good for a while, and now we're right back to the same old thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5701.857s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, we do have a rule that talks about 10 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5706.94s">that</a> I believe it's 10 working days subsequent to any resolution that takes place. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5713.004s">So,</a> Mr. Clark, I'm going to ask you to do the following on your sheet, just to put one additional line in here, and that's the 10-day line, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5722.75s">If</a> the response hasn't come in in 10 days, you have department respondent, date respondent, I would like to have you another line in there to put the 10-day notice, that the 10 days has come and gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5734.377s">That</a> way there, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5736.733s">It's</a> fair and it's open for everyone, and that way people aren't going to try to figure out what the hell are all these lines supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5743.556s">So,</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I just think it's about that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5747.518s">Craddock</a> Bridge, another perfect example. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5749.879s">You</a> know, you get the letter, no information coming back, forthcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5753.101s">You</a> have to find out all this stuff on your own. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5755.61s">It's</a> almost like you have to be your own detective to do your own work, because the city administration just doesn't want to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5762.115s">But</a> then all of a sudden, when they want something, they're on top of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5766.899s">You've</a> got to vote for this, and if you don't vote for this, you're anti-this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5770.422s">Councilman</a> Marks, perfect example. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5772.303s">He</a> and a group of people started because the mayor wouldn't do anything with a dog park, because the mayor said it was going to be over $200,000 to do a dog park. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5779.889s">Council</a> Marks and a group of people get together, they figure out a place, they put something together, and what's the mayor do? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5785.714s">The</a> mayor tries to, you know, grandstand and take it away. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5788.437s">With</a> all due respect, Councilor Camuso, it was your issue that brought up the thing on the opiates and the drugs and the addictions in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5794.763s">And</a> the mayor pulled not only an end run, he tried to pull the rug right from under you to try to make it look like it's his deal now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5800.228s">And</a> that's not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5800.988s">Councilor</a> Longo, you had the thing on 311. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5803.951s">Nothing,</a> no response to that at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5806.668s">It's</a> just, we could go on to each council and what they were here for. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5810.13s">He's</a> just not responding. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5811.631s">And</a> these resolutions are too important. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5813.693s">So</a> Mr. Clerk, my council colleagues, I'm asking that the clerk change his tracking system to include one extra column and that's the 10 day. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5822.919s">Once</a> the 10 days are up, at least we know it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5825.0s">And</a> then the council at that point in time can either take its vote to override them or do what needs to be done.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6240.024s">On</a> this matter, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6242.14s">There</a> are six street lights that are out in the heart of Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6245.301s">I</a> mean, you have to be blind, or maybe you will be because... Visually impaired. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6251.822s">Visually</a> impaired, or whatever you want to call it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6254.382s">I</a> don't know what the mayor doesn't see that everyone else can see. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6258.003s">Maybe</a> he doesn't go out at nighttime, or maybe he doesn't go through Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6261.943s">Problem</a> being, everyone that does go to the square, it's a public safety hazard, it's a public safety risk. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6269.245s">Once</a> again, this past week, <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6271.307s">Electricity</a> went out in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6273.669s">Many</a> businesses were affected by this, affected to the point that it's not the first time that this has happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6279.573s">And</a> as a result of the businesses being out and lost employee time and loss of product, again, the employees were not notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6286.918s">There</a> has been no updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6288.719s">You</a> just have to figure this out. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6290.1s">And</a> I think when you hear all the sirens going around on a particular morning trying to figure out what it is, was it a bank robbery or was it something? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6297.625s">It</a> was the lights that were out. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6299.346s">Also,</a> those lights that were out <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6301.837s">I</a> believe the same situation happened again today when the electricity went down at the McGlynn School. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6307.159s">And</a> as a result of the electricity going down, I don't know if it was an extended period of time or what have you, I was led to believe and I thought that these schools all had backup generators for the purposes of if they lost the electricity. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6319.304s">No,</a> I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6320.564s">This</a> is a couple of parents called up and they were upset over the fact of the matter is that, you know, this took place today. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6326.847s">Why</a> and how it happened, I don't know, but apparently it did. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6331.146s">Back</a> in, I think it was 2001 or 2003, if the city remembers correctly, I think it was in June or July, there was an extreme power outage in the city, and it was down for an extensive period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6342.594s">And</a> National Grid came in, and I believe that it had something to do somewhere off of, I can't think of the name of the street, where they have their transmission lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6353.182s">And</a> they came in there and they put a brand new electrical service into the city of Medford, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6358.766s">And</a> what they did, <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6359.884s">And</a> I believe they put a corollary line that was next to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6363.486s">So</a> just in case, the outage because of the use of electricity, I believe it was a hot summer, this would not happen again. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6370.951s">It</a> would just jump to this other line. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6373.132s">Now,</a> whether this happened at the school today or not, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6376.654s">Whether</a> all the businesses or how many businesses got affected in Medford Square, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6381.117s">But</a> it's apparently, you know, when people call and express their concern as to why this is happening, and they can't get an answer, and it's going to be corrected, <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6389.027s">You</a> have to deal with the business in and of itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6390.908s">Was</a> there a loss of product, loss of employee time, a loss of business? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6396.091s">And</a> the overtime that the police department had to pay to go over there now is direct to traffic and to move people around. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6402.214s">Now,</a> you take all of that, and you just add on one more effect, one more effect that's affecting the people here, and that's the kiosk and the square once again. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6411.299s">And</a> what's going on, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6413.62s">But</a> this was one heck of a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6415.621s">Because</a> no sooner did we meet this past Tuesday night, <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6418.295s">Last</a> Tuesday night, the very next day I'm in Medford Square and there's a gentleman at 634 trying to put money into a meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6426.88s">And</a> I was there with my wife and we said to him, listen sir, you don't have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6430.943s">It</a> stops at six o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6432.744s">He</a> says, I don't know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6433.925s">No</a> sign said that, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6437.007s">Six</a> o'clock, eight to six. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6438.848s">No</a> sign said that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6439.728s">This</a> was 634. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6441.75s">I</a> have another one. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6443.871s">I</a> have another one here. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6444.851s">This</a> one here is dated on 324. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6450.303s">738,</a> supposed to start at 8 o'clock in the morning, 738 AM, giving out tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6456.986s">Now,</a> people who are paying, anyone who might be paying right now, you have to realize something. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6462.009s">It's</a> 8 to 6 in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6463.269s">It</a> became effective March 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6465.21s">That's</a> when the Traffic Commission voted upon it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6467.191s">That's</a> when our city solicitor said it was legal and we could do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6470.252s">And</a> that's when the bounty hunters from Tennessee said it's OK, then we're going to go with these new laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6476.475s">So</a> every dime and every quarter that they're collecting <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6479.132s">is</a> I would say it's right now it's illegal. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6481.914s">They</a> are wrongly collecting and taking money out of that, out of those meters from people that are going there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6490.138s">Councilor</a> Caraviello, you said on December 23rd in your resolution that you wanted a 60-day report, a financial report as to what they were doing, effective when it becomes operative. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6500.084s">Councilor</a> Knight, that was your term, when it becomes operative. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6504.162s">And</a> we agreed to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6505.382s">January</a> 15th is when they went online. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6507.923s">March</a> 15th has come and gone, and we have received absolutely nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6511.223s">Today</a> is March 31st, nothing, zero. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6516.164s">Mr.</a> President, again, this past week on Riverside Avenue, not Riverside Avenue, the ring road, excuse me, where the ring road is, once again, that truck that they own, those bounty hunters from Tennessee, <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6533.407s">who</a> park their truck illegally, illegally on the ring road, and they have the audacity to go out there and give tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6540.87s">It's</a> not marked like it's supposed to be in the back. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6543.831s">They're</a> giving out tickets erroneously, because if people are getting there before 7, strike that, before 8, and after 6 at night, they're still tagging them and giving them tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6554.894s">Councilor</a> Camuso, they want to go back. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6558.104s">Remember</a> what we talked about? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6559.565s">They</a> thought it was going to be a great idea, putting the $5 thing down there and place that road by Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6565.651s">Now</a> we're down to one, with a main plate. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6567.713s">A</a> main plate, okay, the other guy's on vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6571.256s">A</a> main plate of a guy sitting down there, okay, and that's all that they're getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6576.24s">Those</a> cars that were parking there have now filtered their way into the West Mefford area. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6580.985s">Go</a> to the downtown West Mefford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6585.067s">Warren</a> Street and all the side street. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6586.847s">That's</a> where the cars are parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6588.588s">Go</a> to West Medford and strike that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6590.468s">You</a> go to Medford Square, the people, they say, oh yeah, the spots are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6595.629s">The</a> spots are there because people don't want to pay to put their money into the quarter. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6599.15s">Go</a> into CVS and talk to the people there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6601.571s">They're</a> actually having fights with people who are in the armory parking in the CVS parking lot, which that's not their parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6609.292s">Because</a> people don't want to pay to put that quarter in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6612.713s">I</a> was talking to a dentist's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6614.435s">These</a> two women that were in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6615.676s">I</a> was in the eye doctor today. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6618.459s">Four</a> people in the last two days basically saying, you know, we're not coming back to the square because, you know, it's bad enough you can't figure out where the kiosk goes and where it's supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6628.929s">Five</a> or six cars up, five or six cars back. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6631.631s">But</a> how do you go there and put the money in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6634.153s">How</a> do you know when you go to a doctor or a dentist you're not going to be longer than what they expect it to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6638.561s">The</a> stupidest thing of this whole thing, Councilor Camoso, I'm going to go back to what you originally said in the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6643.745s">If</a> in fact the mayor had meters put in, people would understand what a meter looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6648.148s">They</a> would know how to put the money in the meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6650.01s">These</a> kiosks are just doing damage. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6651.871s">Go</a> to the gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6654.943s">Pardon</a> me? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6655.963s">Boston's</a> doing 1,000 new meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6657.464s">But</a> remember the new meters that Boston is doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6660.024s">Don't</a> give them any compliments, because they have figured this thing out. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6662.725s">If</a> it's prime time of the day, and that metered spot is something that they need, they can raise the price on those meters mechanically, technology, from where they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6672.006s">So</a> you could pay a quarter or one minute for 15 minutes, and you could pay a quarter for five minutes if they decide that that's the route that they want to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6680.066s">Mr.</a> President, I have a resolution on here, as you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6684.467s">What</a> I would like to do is to take my other resolution that is, it was from last week, 15-307, take that off the table, and I would like to make a motion, take the motion from that, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7363.839s">The</a> sign here, Councilor Caraviello, the sign says 30-minute limit parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7368.623s">Yeah,</a> but is that free? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7369.544s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7369.964s">Well,</a> those are the two- It says pay META. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7372.546s">Thanks</a> to Councilor Marks, those are the two free 30-minute parking that at the last, I think it was March 3rd or March 15th at the Traffic Commission, they now put them in all four squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7382.415s">So</a> you see the signs there.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7385.677s">No,</a> this says 30-minute parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7389.279s">And</a> then it says Monday through Saturday, 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7391.401s">to</a> 7 p.m.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7398.106s">That's</a> what a bounty hunter does. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7399.568s">Gets</a> as much as they can when they can.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=8074.014s">Last</a> week when we were discussing 15-307, there was a bunch of resolutions and amendments that were on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=8083.121s">One</a> of the amendments reads as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=8084.843s">It's</a> offered by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=8086.104s">It</a> says, amended by Councilor Knight, that a meeting be called with all the parties concerned as previously requested in 30 days and prior to that meeting within 14 days, the Council meeting to share their concerns, complaints, and recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=8097.014s">But</a> if I understand it correctly, you, Mr. President, are going to be calling <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=8100.964s">this</a> meeting for next Tuesday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=8102.505s">Is</a> that true?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=8171.802s">I</a> just want to make sure everybody has enough time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=8173.583s">So</a> they can't say that they can't be here next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=8176.024s">They've</a> got other commitments and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=8178.144s">So,</a> um, with that being said, <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=8181.007s">I'll</a> be willing at this point in time to hold off on my resolution to opt out of the contract until that meeting takes place, but subsequent to that meeting, that resolution, Mr. President, I will once again reinduce that the city of Medford opt out of the, where's the wording here that says the following? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=8203.896s">It</a> says, put it back on the table for the purposes of a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=8208.858s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=8210.754s">motion</a> to table. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=8212.274s">Well,</a> I think it would be maybe just to leave this in the, we just took it off the table and we're going to put it back on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=8219.596s">So</a> that way there are parties that you want to put together at least have more than enough ample time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=8225.277s">Everything</a> that councilor Caraviello was talking about these reports and everything, you know, and that, and that's it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=8246.651s">But</a> you also have constant violations in the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=8248.932s">And</a> Mr. Leggero was correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=8250.053s">The</a> two sites and sections that he announced. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=8252.874s">The</a> fact that the cars aren't even. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=8261.738s">But</a> we asked for them.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=8999.529s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9001.071s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9002.412s">I</a> don't think it's a matter of getting a non-profit person to run it or a for-profit person to run it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9020.791s">Maybe</a> I said it wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9021.912s">What</a> I'm saying, whether you have a non-profit or a for-profit company come in here, not to run public, to run an access channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9030.218s">With</a> that being said, I mean, there's absolutely no transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9036.162s">This</a> council just got through voting last week, and we all agreed to it, that they may not go forward and sign any contract with Comcast until a public hearing takes place. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9044.407s">Now,</a> if I heard the gentleman correctly today, he was told that a fellow by the name of Peter Epstein is the only person that deals with this on behalf of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9051.648s">No,</a> it's been three, it's going on three weeks, three and a half weeks now since the last time I spoke to Mr. Epstein and he called me back. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9058.529s">He</a> said he has not heard anything from anybody here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9062.25s">Well,</a> today's March 31st. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9064.05s">We're</a> dealing with 18 days because according to, from the letter from Xfinity Comcast, they want this thing signed on it before the 18th of April. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9073.502s">How</a> it got into the building, and nobody knows how it got here. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9076.724s">It's</a> not time-stamped or anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9079.046s">Pardon</a> me? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9081.728s">No,</a> no, no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9084.29s">Oh,</a> it could be. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9085.47s">But</a> this letter was dated December 18, and it was hand-delivered by UPS to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9092.455s">So</a> I'm quite sure if somebody wanted to go to UPS, if they'd be willing, they'd be willing to tell you who signed for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9098.86s">But</a> that's not the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9099.76s">The</a> fact of the matter is we just found this out last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9104.008s">This</a> is absolutely crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9105.609s">You</a> know, we haven't had public access in the city, I think, since December or November of 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9110.571s">And</a> that means the last quarter of 2013, all of 14, now coming into 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9117.454s">And</a> during that period of time, that's when Verizon came into the picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9120.795s">So</a> not only do we have Verizon, we have Xfinity. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9123.516s">But</a> unfortunately, just think about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9127.318s">Who</a> in their right mind would want to make a bid to put a public access station up at the high school in the back? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9133.037s">in</a> the back end of the building where it's not on a main street. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9136.06s">The</a> mayor didn't even listen to his own three-member person that he had a panel and powered from February to March of this past year, February to Memorial Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9146.608s">And</a> the first thing, it has to be in a centrally located position. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9151.773s">Well,</a> behind the high school, up in the high school is not a centrally located position, especially if you have to get off the bus and it's dark at night, there's no protection there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9160.662s">But</a> that's not the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9161.703s">The</a> fact of the matter is this, that we as a council do have a voice, and the voice is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9168.067s">It's</a> unfortunate, but maybe it's the only voice that you can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9171.248s">You</a> have injunctive relief. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9172.469s">This</a> council can go into a mode of injunctive relief. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9175.631s">This</a> council can get a hold of 10 rate payers and ask them to go into a mode of injunctive relief. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9181.255s">This</a> council can stop the mayor in his tracks at budget time because he has not listened to the biggest issues that this council has been able to talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9189.012s">The</a> priority of this council 2014 was a new police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9192.875s">That</a> was his number one priority and all seven of us agreed upon it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9196.297s">And</a> you haven't seen one thing from that guy across the hall to respond back to a new police station by this council or any citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9203.723s">His</a> only comment was through Mrs. Burke when she was down here, maybe in seven years, in seven years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9211.405s">I</a> mean, we'll all be out of here, gone someplace, and who knows what the financial condition of the community is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9218.288s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9219.408s">None</a> of us know. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9220.228s">But</a> you have $7.5 million sitting in a Water and Sewer account, but no indication of where that money is going. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9225.93s">If</a> you get $300,000 in this particular account, no indication where that money is going. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9231.312s">And</a> if the gentleman at the podium is correct, <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9233.609s">that</a> you can't find somebody who's reputable to build this station, then all we've done is absolutely nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9240.813s">And</a> if I understand correctly, if Comcast has the availability through the contract that the mayor does sign to take that channel away from the city, well, where is the 5% worth of revenues that the city basically would have as it relates to the contract? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9262.03s">That's</a> the agreement, it's 5%. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9264.811s">3%</a> goes to the city, 2% goes between public access, channel 16 and channel 15, which is the educational channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9274.313s">This</a> has been floundering way, way, way too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9277.554s">The</a> mayor has just been a constant refuser to participate with this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9282.516s">He's</a> been a constant refuser to be transparent with this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9287.357s">He's</a> been a constant refuser to want to be part <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9290.628s">of</a> Medford's city government. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9292.93s">This</a> is not a dictatorship, this is not an emperorship. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9296.372s">This</a> is a group of elected officials that have to answer to the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9301.196s">Every</a> one of us have to answer to the people, including him. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9304.739s">But</a> so far, he's got a free ride because nobody wants the job maybe anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9308.922s">Because</a> maybe everybody realizes that it's decent, that the job isn't worth it because of what they're gonna have to go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9316.487s">The</a> guy has never woke up in the morning, ever had to open a door, <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9320.572s">turn</a> the key, hire employees, pay workman's comp, pay for the electric, pay for the gas, pay for everything that makes a business have to run. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9330.117s">And</a> then, at the same time, tries to tell the taxpayers of this community what they have to pay for and how they should be taxed continuously and continuously and without a voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9340.523s">It's</a> not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9341.744s">It's</a> not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9343.245s">Mr.</a> President, I don't know where we can go with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9346.406s">The</a> council was as clear as a bell not to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9349.873s">requesting</a> the mayor not to go forward with a 10-year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9353.156s">You</a> know, if he does go forward with a 10-year contract, again, the people of this community have been snickered. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9359.121s">And,</a> you know, where do we go? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9360.522s">What</a> do we tell the ratepayers of this community? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9362.924s">What</a> do we tell the citizens? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9364.585s">What</a> are we here for? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9366.09s">if</a> we can't do anything that makes any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9369.051s">This</a> doesn't mean you have to be against him on everything, but it seems to be that way because he just doesn't want to talk to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9375.272s">He</a> just wants to talk to the newspaper. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9377.512s">You</a> have to find things out through the newspaper. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9380.093s">Like</a> today, he had to find out through the newspaper about the dog park that supposedly now looks like it's coming out of his grand scheme of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9387.274s">That</a> became a genesis of people that had dogs who were so upset not being able to have a dog park in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9393.773s">And</a> every time they came up with the idea, oh, no, it's going to cost too much, $200,000, $300,000, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9399.656s">Well,</a> if you do some work, as Councilor Marks and the committee did, and shop around, you will see that not only you can build a decent dog park, there are monies out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9407.7s">And</a> so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9409.501s">You</a> know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9410.902s">We</a> talk about this stuff each and every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9413.303s">I</a> think the coup d'etat's going to come when we have that meeting toward the end of the month as it relates to the kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9419.566s">We'll</a> find out what this is all about, because businesses and the folks <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9423.591s">They're</a> going to start to tell you that they're hurting. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9425.632s">They're</a> going to tell you that business is off and customers are leaving because of the craziness of the kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9430.395s">And</a> you're right, Councilor Caraviello, when you turned around and you said, you put the money in the kiosk, you don't know where you're supposed to go, left, right, up or down, five or six spots, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9439.74s">But</a> if they think they're going to go out of their way to mock and spot off the kiosk when the streets are in deplorable condition, the crosswalks don't even exist anymore, the potholes are beyond help, then there will be a problem around here. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9452.788s">And</a> that gentleman who's here, I don't think he's gone now, he's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9456.49s">He's</a> right on the RFP as it's being an amendment to the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9461.252s">They</a> have obligations. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9462.613s">And</a> I think it was the lady who appeared here some two or three weeks ago who made the comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9466.515s">She</a> made the comment as clear as a bell. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9468.596s">We</a> can sue them, or we can get out of the contract, but there is an offset. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9471.798s">And</a> there are offsets to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9473.359s">And</a> the offsets to that whole contract are the failures and the intentional neglect and the results <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9482.362s">I</a> call them the bounty hunters from Tennessee, them taking our money, running around and not adhering to the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9488.467s">They</a> can't even get their cars straight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9490.549s">They</a> can't even get the details straight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9493.271s">And</a> the police should be all over them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9494.712s">They</a> should be out there towing their cars because they're supposed to be mocked. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9498.235s">This</a> week they're mocked on the ring road over there in a spot that they're not supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9503.079s">They've</a> been in front of hydrants. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9505.34s">They've</a> been in front of handicapped spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9509.515s">Mr.</a> President, I don't know where we're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9510.916s">You</a> know, this is frustration talking here right now, as you can tell. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9513.979s">You</a> got a new haircut, I can tell. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9515.38s">But</a> that's beside the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9516.801s">The</a> fact of the matter is... Thank you, and thank you to John DeVito.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9862.03s">I</a> don't think you can, because the way this new contract is written or being amended, if it's not used for public access, then they have the right to take the channel back. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9869.655s">It</a> cannot be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9871.977s">It's</a> only to be used one of two ways, public access, or they take it back.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=967.883s">I</a> think one of the concerns before, just one council member just resurrected this in my head, on the lighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=974.826s">And</a> they wanted to make sure it was not going to be intrusive to the apartment buildings to the immediate left of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=980.108s">I</a> just don't know how the lighting is going to affect the apartments that are going to be behind you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=984.189s">And</a> can we get some kind of a lighting scheme as to what's going to go in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=988.571s">Because</a> if it's going to be intrusive to the new development in the back, I think we're going to have to address that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2025.239s">It</a> will not be lit?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2027.92s">So</a> this outside seating area will have no lights at all at any time during the day or night?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2038.822s">So</a> maybe, Councilor Mack, you can make a request that there be no lighting there after 11 o'clock at night? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2046.488s">No,</a> he said there is some along the side. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2050.771s">Nothing</a> near the patio at all.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3229.05s">I</a> do not believe you can waive a public hearing, Mr. Clark. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3232.011s">Can</a> you or can you not? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3232.971s">Do</a> it quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3233.851s">It's</a> for the public.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3239.392s">No,</a> it's a public hearing because you're asking to waive one of the ingredients of the hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3243.073s">Can't</a> the Council... The Chair will... The Chair will... Wait a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3247.973s">If</a> the Council votes for this right now and then for next week have a motion of reconsideration on the time sequence on that, can we do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3255.195s">On</a> the license. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3255.975s">You</a> would have to reconsider. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3258.077s">Tomorrow,</a> but we wouldn't have to go to the whole public hearing process and advertising or anything like that, correct?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3311.506s">No,</a> he just said no. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3312.426s">You</a> have to have the hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3313.146s">You</a> have to go through the whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3314.427s">He</a> has to read the paper.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3507.793s">I</a> forgot your name. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3508.374s">What</a> is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3509.255s">Tony.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3509.615s">Tony?</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3511.256s">Why</a> do you want three o'clock? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3512.958s">Have</a> you done some kind of analysis that says you're going to make a lot of money up to three o'clock?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3551.824s">One</a> of my concerns, I want to go back to Councilor Marks, and you talked about the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3554.806s">And</a> it's true, in a hot summer's night, air conditioning's in a whole bunch of nine yards. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3559.41s">Are</a> you comfortable, John Edwards, are you comfortable with 3 o'clock as compared to 2?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3577.624s">That's</a> open 24 hours? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3579.546s">The</a> Dunkin' Donuts on the mall?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3629.965s">The</a> three o'clock is not going to be every night?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3639.172s">So</a> when we review this thing in six months, it's possible that you may not even be open until three, you may only be open until two or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3645.117s">Correct.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3902.568s">All</a> set, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3903.969s">Quick</a> question.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3906.851s">You</a> have a note here from Diane as it relates to everything looking good, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3910.692s">One</a> of your entrances having two feet, three inches, has that been corrected?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3949.863s">She</a> makes something here, which I've never seen before. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3951.624s">It</a> says, do you have people who will seat them, or will they seat themselves? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3955.367s">And</a> do you have an accessible seating policy? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3957.568s">Is</a> that something new?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3969.434s">But</a> will the person seat these people in this area?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3975.757s">I've</a> just never seen that before.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4796.063s">Real</a> quick, I'd like to just insert one question, where you have five dollars, it should be for a citizen copy. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4804.948s">Okay,</a> so that way you're there because governmental agencies <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4808.194s">would</a> be entitled to it anyway.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5724.091s">Mr.</a> President, after I put this resolution on board, if anybody saw it, Apple, the Apple industry, Apple Computer Company, came out with their newest and latest of technologies for which they even allege it will be a challenge to Comcast customers. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5739.869s">as</a> it relates to not only their streaming, but also as it relates to the technology of being able to get that for which Comcast is offering its subscribers, as well as other internet providers. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5753.275s">Also,</a> Mr. President, unfortunately or fortunately, however you want to look at it, we got this letter dated December 18th that was delivered by UPS to this building over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5765.08s">Unfortunately,</a> it wasn't timestamped, so whoever had it and sat on it, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5769.637s">and</a> didn't relay it to the council as they should have, or to the city clerk's office as they should have, it just really presents a big issue because the 10 years is just about expiring, which is right around the corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5782.782s">There's</a> been no talk of having a public hearing, for which the mayor apparently is refusing to have because you're less than a month away, a little bit more than a month away to do this advertising. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5794.367s">Also,</a> there's an obligation, I believe under the contract, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5798.617s">Even</a> according to the folks from Xfinity, which is Mr. Kelly, and he writes in his letter of December 18th, that we didn't get until just last week, that the city has an obligation under the formal renewal process to either accept or deny Comcast's proposal within four months, or no later than April 18th. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5818.267s">And</a> this was hand-delivered by UPS on December 18th, and we received it last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5824.11s">Taking</a> that into consideration, and now seeing what's out there, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5828.314s">We</a> know what's happened with 10-year contracts here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5831.736s">The</a> first one is the rubbish contract for 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5834.417s">The</a> latest one is the outrageous kiosks that are operating here in the city of Medford, causing all kinds of problems, not only to our residents, but also to the small business people in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5844.421s">And</a> now the mayor wants to saddle us again with another 10-year contract, and this time giving absolutely no public access for the purposes of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5854.605s">The</a> unfortunate part about all of this, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5857.51s">The</a> technologies are so far advanced out there that if you traverse yourself out to the states of California and in that particular territory, those folks that had even public access on the peg stations are now moving to get rid of them because they are basically alleging that they're serving no purpose other than making a huge cost and a dent in the cost of cable subscription. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5879.714s">I</a> believe Comcast and Verizon, as it relates to both of their service people, have merged in many of those cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5886.409s">as</a> far as the service goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5888.01s">And</a> there is some movement that maybe Xfinity and Verizon might even merge in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5892.374s">But</a> that's just another issue right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5894.435s">Right</a> now we're dealing with the 10-year issue that the city should not go forward and sign this contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5898.999s">And</a> anyone who has Comcast out there right now, send a letter, call the mayor's office, and just tell them not to sign this contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5906.585s">What's</a> Comcast going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5907.666s">Just</a> pick up and walk out of the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5909.047s">I</a> don't think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5910.127s">But</a> the fact of the matter is the technology is so far advanced right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5913.27s">It's</a> out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5913.99s">It's</a> happening right in front of our faces, and Apple, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5916.527s">Couldn't</a> have proved it anymore, as they did last Thursday when they came out online. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5920.05s">They</a> did a seven and a half minute demo of showing how advanced, not only are they over cable television, but the new technologies that are out there, plus their merging and interaction with other subsidiaries that are into this particular type of a situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5935.381s">We've</a> seen also what's happened with the PEG access stations, when communities around us got themselves in trouble by misappropriating the funds, who went to jail for eight years, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5946.693s">Who's</a> being subject to an attorney general investigation? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5949.174s">And</a> it's just not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5952.214s">We</a> have here in our own city of Medford an investigation that's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5955.875s">We</a> were led to believe at some point in time that the public access channel was going to file dissolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5962.137s">And</a> they said they were, and they haven't. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5964.438s">We</a> have papers here tonight that come from the attorney general's office, especially the charitable affairs division, which are basically saying it is still under investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5974.53s">I</a> don't know how much more investigation it can be when there's hundreds of thousands of dollars missing and unaccounted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5980.052s">But</a> when they're missing and unaccounted for, and the mayor of this community sits by and does absolutely nothing about it, and then he wants to even entertain possibly thinking of signing a new 10-year contract with a company that does nothing more than raise the rates each and every time they have a chance. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5998.598s">And</a> it's the same mayor in this community who happens to have a pretty good deal <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6002.908s">Concast,</a> who recently gave him $5,000 for whatever he wanted to use within the community, and I believe there's a $30,000 or thereabout in account that he has used to do whatever he's wanted, unbeknownst to this council as it relates to whatever he feels a charitable event needs to take place here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6020.302s">You</a> know, Mr. Kelly, who's the Director of Governmental Affairs and Regulations, has never offered that to the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6026.807s">He's</a> never made that away to the taxpayers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6029.738s">I'm</a> not so sure the mayor would want to sign this because he has a particular perk that he gets out of this for himself to use whatever he wants to use. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6037.065s">I'm</a> not so sure, Mr. President, that public access here in the city of Medford, for which the city has in its coffers in excess of $300,000, if not more, that have been taken from subscribers to Comcast, who have had no public access for well over a year and a half or thereabouts, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6054.237s">is</a> the right way to go now in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6056.398s">The</a> mayor wants to put this new public access channel up at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6060.0s">It</a> is not readily available, it's not easily accessible, it's not on a bus route that way you get off, it's an easily walking distance, and especially at nighttime, it presents itself with a handicap and a public safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6073.008s">So</a> with that being said, and recognizing that there was a three-member commission that the mayor empowered earlier this year, whether he agreed or disagreed with the folks that were on there, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6082.678s">They</a> did make recommendations that basically talked about keeping this thing centrally located, easily accessible, and something that could work. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6089.72s">And</a> to this day, the mayor still doesn't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6093.181s">He's</a> quoted a saying back in 2014, excuse me, before the election, that public access would be made available and it would be in the city of Medford and it would be operational. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6103.023s">Well,</a> where is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6104.223s">It</a> doesn't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6105.864s">The</a> mayor has taken personal advantage on the public access of Channel 15, the educational channel for his own, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6112.095s">personal</a> use for which he uses personnel from the high school for his own personal public affairs to have him televised anytime he wants on their dime while they should be teaching in school, not doing, they shouldn't be taking care of him. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6127.04s">You</a> know, we just heard tonight from the subcommittee of the council that was on relative to having our council meetings put on the government access. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6134.022s">I</a> mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6134.505s">to</a> be put on the city's website. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6137.045s">That</a> would be a great way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6138.626s">But</a> I doubt it, if the mayor would allow that, because if there's anything that's controversial that doesn't speak well of the mayor, it's not gonna go. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6144.867s">It's</a> not gonna show. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6146.467s">You</a> know, Comcast, they may have been good at one point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6150.828s">I</a> know Councilor Camuso, you had made comment, I think it was last week or two weeks ago, that maybe we should go back and just rescind the order that the council voted on, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6158.769s">We</a> never got an answer back from the city clerk on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6161.25s">So,</a> pardon me?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6171.8s">Okay,</a> so with that being said, be it a homeroom petition or what have you, I don't think it's fair, especially to the ratepayers, who keep paying each and every month, each and every month, each and every month, and getting nothing forward, you know, and that's the problem with society today. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6185.108s">People</a> become so inundated with all these nuances, they just let it go by, and while they let it go by, the city keeps generating money, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6193.311s">In</a> an account that serves no purpose for the rate payers, and at the same time, the mayor has an extreme advantage of taking those monies to be used that he has going with Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6204.518s">And</a> one final comment, Mr. President, you know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6218.326s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6227.576s">The</a> issue of the 5% is the franchise fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6229.978s">That</a> was a home rule which is broken down to 3, 1, and 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6232.2s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6233.021s">With</a> that being said, Mr. President, I just don't think it's fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6236.425s">I</a> don't think the city should go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6238.467s">I</a> think the mayor should be getting, the council should direct them not to sign this contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6243.554s">especially</a> not having a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6246.036s">And</a> more importantly, what are we getting? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6248.017s">If</a> we lock ourselves into another 10-year deal, God knows what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6252.339s">The</a> rates, Councilor Caraviello, you just said it, what are we getting? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6255.061s">All</a> we're getting is the rates just keep going up and up and up, and you're getting nothing forward in return. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6259.444s">And</a> it's just not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6261.545s">And</a> with that being said, I'll open it up to anybody, other questions, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6375.283s">Well,</a> a point of, just a point of further clarification.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6378.784s">The</a> peg access is very specific by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6380.965s">It</a> has to be used for public access, educational, government channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6383.786s">And</a> the other thing that nobody has talked about, why does it have to be for a non-profit? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6387.767s">Why</a> can't it not be for a for-profit? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6390.088s">And</a> if it was a for-profit, you might have a different attitude of people coming in here and saying, hey, not only can we do it and raise money for the community, you don't have to worry about public access because the for-profit will take care of the whole situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6403.45s">And</a> you know, and that's something that the mayor is not even entertained. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6407.074s">He</a> doesn't even, he doesn't have the ability to figure this thing out. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6410.457s">We</a> were paying a guy named Peter Epstein, something like $325 an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6414.741s">And</a> that was the gentleman who did the last hearing 10 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6418.385s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6419.046s">And</a> he has yet to be contacted the last time I spoke to him, which is probably within the past three weeks to a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6424.771s">And</a> so if the mayor has no intention of having this public hearing, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6427.964s">and</a> he intends to have a 10-year contract signed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6431.326s">That's</a> absolutely unfair to every single ratepayer, subscriber in this community, to know what's going on, and at the same time, it doesn't serve the taxpayer any benefit at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6440.752s">They're</a> getting nothing out of this 10-year contract, except the mayor is the one that becomes the beneficiary.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7365.185s">I</a> believe through the years it's been approximately $30,000 that the Mayor's been able to use. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7370.14s">For</a> whatever he feels he wants to use it for.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7477.861s">Councilor</a> Penta was waiting for the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7481.284s">I'd</a> be willing to amend it that reads the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7483.685s">Be</a> it resolved that the Medford City Council go on record <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7486.55s">advising</a> the mayor on behalf of Comcast subscribers not to enter into any contract agreement until a public hearing takes place with Comcast to be effective as of August 20th since, in fact, and I think that's what you were leading to. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7500.637s">Why</a> sign a contract at all? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7502.157s">We</a> haven't even had our public hearing.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7511.299s">Well,</a> that's a separate issue, because right now the contract is—the public vendor's going to have nothing to do with the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7517.36s">Because</a> the contract is— The contract's the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7520.481s">The</a> contract is having a 10-year deal with Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7522.941s">That's</a> where he's going. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7524.101s">Inclusive</a> of the contract is going to be having public access in whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7528.462s">The</a> key here is, if you don't want him to sign a 10-year contract, and you want the public hearing to get input from the community, you do that, or you just tell him not to sign a 10-year contract.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7556.163s">I'll</a> read it again.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7559.464s">Be</a> it resolved that the Medford City Council go on record advising the Mayor on behalf of Comcast subscribers not to enter into any contract agreement <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7568.409s">Hold</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7569.669s">Slow,</a> slow, slow. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7571.41s">All</a> he has to do after the word to, where it says not to, just insert the words enter into any contract agreement until a public hearing takes place with Comcast to be effective as of April 20th and then continue on. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7585.673s">You</a> get it?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7591.494s">After</a> the word to, enter into any contract agreement until a public hearing takes place. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7597.635s">because</a> that is so important. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7599.416s">People</a> don't realize that that public hearing talks about exactly what's going on in this city and what Comcast is offering other than work. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7607.401s">Would</a> you be the rates just keep going up and up and up and nobody's got a chance to talk about this.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7657.345s">They</a> have profit public.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7734.798s">–</a> You can have for-profit that does not have to go through Comcast, because they're not going to come under those regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7740.88s">You</a> will have a legitimate for-profit company come in here and run a cable company. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7746.362s">Well,</a> it'll be a public access, but they won't follow the same guidelines as if you're going to have it under Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7751.363s">That's</a> the difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7753.504s">They</a> have guidelines that they're going to have to follow, but it won't come under the Comcast contract.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7854.956s">I'll</a> somewhat disagree with that, only for one reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7857.057s">The</a> idea of having the public hearing is to get information from the ratepayers that are going to tell you what they like, what they don't like, or what they would like to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7865.022s">Then</a> they take that information and go back and negotiate. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7867.364s">If</a> you don't have any public hearing and you don't have any public information, what are you negotiating?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8107.14s">Mr.</a> President, once again, this week is another one of these weeks relative to the whole parking thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8112.844s">Having</a> discussions with the Chief of Police <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8115.056s">and</a> small business people, people who are getting tickets, machines that just aren't working, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8120.719s">So</a> let me start off with the first one right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8123.481s">Here</a> is a picture of a poll that says 30-minute parking Monday through Saturday, 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8131.225s">to</a> 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8133.606s">On</a> March 10th of this year, that law was changed to 8 to 6. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8139.009s">These</a> signs are still up and people are still getting tickets for which now the chief is getting phone calls <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8145.018s">as</a> it relates to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8146.959s">I</a> have here a ticket that's issued on the 18th of March, where somebody put the money in the meter, and the meter stopped collecting it and collecting it, for which they shouldn't have collected the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8161.943s">Now,</a> Councilor Caraviello, you made a resolution back on December 23rd as it relates to having the city come forward <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8171.334s">and</a> present to the council a 60-day evaluation take place by the mayor and Republican. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8176.638s">The</a> 60 days has come and gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8179.02s">Then</a> on January 2nd of this past year, you also had a resolution as it related to the kiosks on the face of the kiosk being legible so you could read it, and you still can't read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8190.069s">Again</a> this past week, we have the truck, once again, in downtown Medford, in other parts of the city, again in violation of the contract <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8201.134s">Nothing</a> to be seen on the back saying that this truck makes frequent stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8205.738s">The</a> mayor has just intentionally allowed, allowed this company from Republic from Tennessee to go forward and continuously keep breaking and breaking the laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8216.487s">Now,</a> the other part of the contract basically says the following that, you know, we are supposed to be getting some kind of information forthcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8224.854s">I</a> believe today, again, speaking to the chief outside, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8228.439s">He</a> had to go down and speak to some folks next to, I believe, Mystic Valley Pediatrics. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8236.184s">Next</a> to there, there's a beauty shop over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8238.406s">The</a> women over there are up in arms and they're all afraid because they think they're going to get tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8242.689s">Who's</a> parked in the parking lot? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8244.19s">The</a> two kiosks are against the wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8246.912s">The</a> records reflect, as we just get, that in January of this past year before the city council, Republic was supposed to go over and meet with the senior citizens <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8256.786s">to</a> explain to them the whole kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8259.247s">And</a> here we have here a letter dated March 19th, addressed to you, Council President Dello Russo, that on April 3rd, they're going to go over there and discuss how to use a kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8269.792s">From</a> January to April 3rd, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8274.055s">Huge.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8274.695s">I</a> mean, they're right on the ball with all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8277.196s">The</a> fact of the matter is that the machines are still taking the money, and where does that extra money go to? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8282.619s">Is</a> it coming to the city of Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8284.079s">Is</a> it going into Republic? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8285.98s">We</a> talk about the people getting tickets, full-scale observation. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8292.365s">West</a> Method, on Playstead Road, where Playstead Road and Winthrop Street meets, there were 15 to 17 cars on any one given day that used to be parked there, and they never got a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8303.713s">Now</a> you're lucky if you see one, if not two, cars at the very most. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8307.566s">And</a> you know where those cars are parking? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8309.467s">Those</a> cars are parking all on the side streets, and they're going into the neighborhoods, and the complaints are starting to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8316.572s">Go</a> to the parking lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8318.693s">Supposed</a> to be three-hour parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8321.054s">The</a> sign's still up there for two hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8323.857s">So</a> how do you turn around and give somebody a ticket? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8326.578s">Today,</a> someone who was a business merchant in West Medford and a business merchant in Medford Square who paid their $100 for the pass got themselves tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8336.082s">They</a> got themselves tickets today with the permit because they were parked in the municipal parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8342.585s">On</a> Boston Avenue, in front of this sign over here, where a legitimate delivery was being made, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8349.402s">and</a> the trunk was open and the merchandise was coming out, the guy in the truck goes up there and gives them a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8356.949s">How</a> do you give someone a ticket when you're in a legitimate spot? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8359.571s">Tell</a> me. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8360.532s">Councilor</a> Marks, you made a comment a little while ago when this thing was going on, that once this thing started to get going, you gotta be careful because they're gonna be taking aggressive action. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8370.34s">They're</a> doing more than taking aggressive action. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8372.822s">Look</a> at the tickets that they're giving out. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8374.564s">You'd</a> think they would at least put the courtesy, like every other city in town, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8377.388s">from</a> the back of the ticket that at least gives you the telephone number. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8380.711s">You</a> have to figure out where 557 Main Street is. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8383.293s">A</a> lot of people don't know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8385.174s">A</a> senior citizen, a senior citizen in Medford Square trying to figure out how to put money in the machine when they didn't have any change and they didn't have a credit card and trying to figure it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8397.083s">It</a> just doesn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8398.164s">Medford</a> is not that type of a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8400.586s">Why</a> the mayor is doing this, I have absolutely no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8403.928s">But</a> again, he's in complete violation <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8406.905s">The</a> contract has been in complete violation, you know, since this thing operated. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8412.751s">It's</a> beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8414.232s">What</a> about the credit cards that you're putting in? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8416.875s">And</a> they're reading the wrong numbers for the license plate. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8420.078s">Last</a> week we got a complete description. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8421.599s">I</a> have a complete description here from a nurse, a doctor, and the patients that just couldn't negotiate what's going on in Riverside Avenue in that big, huge parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8432.852s">Imagine,</a> we came here, had a big discussion with the people from Republic who stood at that podium that night and said, we are going to go over because the seniors were having a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8441.259s">We'll</a> probably give them 25 pocket spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8443.341s">That</a> was in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8444.602s">And</a> now they're going to go there on April 3rd, which isn't even here yet, April 3rd, to show and discuss with them how to put the money in the machine, which is almost 400 feet away from <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8454.55s">from</a> where they park their cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8456.111s">It</a> makes absolutely no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8457.552s">Go</a> outside and sit in front of City Hall over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8459.693s">They</a> have a stupid little meter on the corner of the road over there, so if you park all the way in the parking lot over here, you're gonna figure out I gotta walk all the way over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8468.117s">It</a> doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8470.178s">Mr.</a> President, page four of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8476.461s">I</a> am going to suggest tonight that the city exercises its right, as it states here, to fully terminate this contract <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8484.666s">with</a> Republic before it gets any worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8487.528s">We</a> haven't even seen, we haven't even seen, as we've been told, the next phase of where these kiosks are going to go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8495.913s">There</a> are business districts and streets and locations that don't even have them yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8500.896s">Once</a> they have them, this is just going to accelerate and multiply. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8505.099s">I'm</a> going to make an offer here for the mayor tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8508.241s">He</a> can go out of this thing being a hero, rather than having the council come after him. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8512.964s">Mr.</a> Mayor, this is what I'm saying to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8515.311s">You</a> came to the council a few years ago, and you asked us to take a million point two out of our water and sewer surplus account. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8522.133s">Councilman</a> Marks was the only one that voted against it, and looking back, he did the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8526.195s">Probably</a> the worst mistake I ever made, but I gave it to you at that point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8529.636s">Never</a> a thank you in return, because that's what we needed to balance the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8534.197s">I'm</a> asking you to take whatever it is <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8537.245s">You</a> take the cost of what the contract says, of what it cost them to put this thing together, you amortize that over the minus the deductions of what we're being paid, and we'll pay the difference, seven, eight, nine hundred thousand dollars, let these people leave this community, let the people go back to their normal way of owning and operating their small little business, not being afraid of getting tagged and towed and ticketed wrongly, not being afraid to know that I'm going to lose a customer, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8565.416s">because</a> they didn't put the money in the meter, not to be afraid of a lady falling down and the snow that's going to be taken by an ambulance to the hospital because she was trying to put her money into the kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8575.24s">Go</a> out a hero and admit that we made a mistake and we're going to go back to the original idea of having traffic enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8583.924s">We</a> will do this in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8585.484s">We</a> will get local people and we'll move ourselves forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8589.386s">And</a> I think everybody at that point in time would say thank you, Mr. Mayor, for understanding <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8594.775s">the</a> impact that this is going to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8596.717s">You</a> know, Councilor Camuslo, you said something in one of the very first meetings a long time ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8600.68s">You</a> turned around and said that you were in favor of putting parking meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8604.484s">And</a> if parking meters were going to be the issue then, like it would be now, I don't think anybody would have, I think they would have understood it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8611.069s">But</a> this has turned out to be a major, major disaster. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8614.953s">With</a> that being said, Mr. President, I get pictures, I get more and more stories, I get more and more people. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8620.999s">giving</a> me the authority to use their names. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8622.879s">I</a> think it's obvious. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8624.12s">And</a> you know the thing that's really funny about all this? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8626.16s">Can</a> you imagine the mayor having the audacity, and that's the word I would use, the audacity to say, he hasn't received one complaint. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8631.801s">He</a> hasn't received one complaint on this traffic program. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8636.443s">Go</a> walk the streets, Mr. Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8639.543s">Go</a> walk the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8640.964s">Look</a> at these people. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8641.844s">Ask</a> them what they say. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8644.444s">Unbelievable.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8646.065s">That</a> being said, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8647.853s">I</a> know it could be a tough vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8648.994s">Maybe</a> people will want to vote for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8650.276s">Maybe</a> they won't. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8650.896s">But</a> the message goes back to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8653.058s">You</a> can do it one of two ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8654.54s">You</a> can voluntarily get out of it or the council is going to make a suggestion that you go out of it and terminate this contract with Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8662.228s">And</a> I don't think there's anybody in this room and any businesses in this community that would turn around and say, OK, we can do that, you know, and if we have a problem, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8670.541s">If</a> we have a problem with enforcement, we will address it, but we will address it in-house, and we will start very slow. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8676.504s">We</a> don't have to have an out-of-town company called Republic from Tennessee, who takes almost 68% of the net profit before the city of Medford sees a dime. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8686.59s">And</a> now we're going to be dealing with this type of aggressive taxation on the people of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8693.894s">Plus,</a> it's a 10-year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8695.515s">How</a> many of these 10-year contracts does this mayor think the people in this community <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8700.879s">should</a> stomach. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8701.52s">It's</a> wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8702.401s">There's</a> no need for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8703.762s">So,</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I move that the city of Medford remove itself, terminate its contract with the Republic of Tennessee—I think that's the name—Republic Parking of Tennessee in the best interests of the taxpayers, the small business people, and the city of Medford as a whole.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8896.171s">Resolution</a> is 14795, December 3rd, 60-day review.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9135.984s">Mr.</a> President, you know, a lot of the times when the Republic was here for a couple of meetings and the chief was here, we gave a whole bunch of concerns that we had, and, you know, we got some of our responses back. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9146.974s">I</a> think the main one was changing the hours from 7 to 7 to 8 to 6. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9152.513s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9152.953s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9166.03s">Also</a> with single head meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9167.291s">Now</a> how do you justify putting up the signs and telling you, you have 30 minute parking, but tagging people? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9174.814s">And</a> then having the audacity, as Councilor Caraviello says, being arrogant, well if you don't like it, appeal it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9179.796s">Why</a> should somebody have to appeal something if they're parked in a spot that's legitimately for 30 minutes, and take some time off from work, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9187.159s">And</a> we don't even have our hearing officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9189.16s">Our</a> hearing officer, unfortunately, she's not in right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9192.56s">And</a> now there's some concern that maybe, that Republic is doing some of these hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9197.982s">I</a> don't know if that's true or false. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9199.302s">Maybe</a> we should make that as another paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9201.182s">Because</a> if they're doing that, that's, again, outside the scope of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9204.903s">You</a> know, you have parking meters taking money after 7 o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9210.264s">Councilor</a> Caraviello, it was your resolution that said <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9214.606s">No</a> charge for the parking period after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9218.187s">You</a> can delay this thing all you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9220.108s">The</a> fact of the matter is they've had more than enough time. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9223.029s">You</a> can't be driving around since January not having the proper signage on the truck. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9228.011s">It</a> took these to get the signage on the side of the truck and they were still doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9232.698s">I</a> spoke to the chief tonight, and the chief turned around and said, I told Dan Nash, you know, this is unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9237.822s">Well,</a> that's not the point of being unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9239.543s">It's</a> a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9240.524s">If</a> you're in violation of the contract, then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9243.366s">We</a> put that guy tonight through the torches of hell, the poor guy at Wendy's over an outside thing, and here a multi-million dollar company comes in, and they can walk around and do anything they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9253.093s">Take</a> the money after six o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9255.654s">Tag</a> people improperly. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9257.956s">I</a> won't say illegally, improperly. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9259.817s">Another</a> guy was in the loading zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9262.218s">Tag</a> a guy who's legitimate in a loading zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9265.119s">It's</a> wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9265.9s">It's</a> wrong, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9268.521s">It's</a> just plain wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9273.244s">You</a> guys can do whatever you want, ladies, but all I know is, I'm moving on the question, strongly suggesting to the mayor to terminate the contract ASAP, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9282.202s">and</a> behalf of the taxpayers of this community, because of their failure to abide by the contract as amended, and that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9288.547s">You</a> know, another thing, you know, and I think it was you, Adam, who came up with, and rightfully so, the suggestion about the signs, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9298.015s">It</a> was a violation of the contract and the signs and this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9300.397s">And</a> now because of that, you don't see any of these signs up. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9303.459s">If</a> you go and you talk to them and they say, well, it's the city's fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9306.702s">The</a> city's fault for what? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9308.523s">That</a> you've got the wrong signs up and you're not, and you've not been putting <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9312.086s">the</a> proper signs up, and you haven't changed the two hours to three hours in certain parts of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9318.147s">And</a> you have certain parts of residential neighborhoods that have kiosks in front of them that don't belong there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9323.069s">And</a> don't buy it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9324.669s">With</a> all due respect, Mr. President, I'm going to move the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9327.41s">MR.</a> PICARDY.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9360.772s">Whatever</a> the cost is, yes.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9379.83s">Well,</a> there are violations in the contract that have to have offsets to it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9390.789s">I'd</a> rather give him the direction rather than sitting down, but again, I've had enough direction, but before this group, as I say to you, I get I get these calls all day long.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9506.871s">For</a> the contract, I think it's a 90-day clause, and then they have to work it out.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11161.542s">I</a> heard what you said. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11162.462s">I</a> heard what everybody said. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11164.563s">That</a> this is what I get every single day between phone calls and dealing with people. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11168.564s">And</a> the fact of the matter is that that guy over there says nobody's complained. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11172.846s">Well,</a> if nobody's complained to him and we've all heard the complaints, either by phone calls, letters, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11178.53s">people</a> getting tagged signs going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11181.615s">There</a> was nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11182.356s">There's</a> no honoring that for which the contract says they were supposed to be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11187.598s">I'm</a> not going to continue to go on. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11189.179s">There</a> are more important things to do out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11190.761s">We</a> have a resolution coming up talking about potholes in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11194.403s">That's</a> going to be huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11195.464s">It's</a> going to be so huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11197.666s">That's</a> just one of many things. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11200.028s">And</a> the mayor's worried about having his community day, having this and having that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11203.61s">I'm</a> more concerned about how this city should run according to every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11209.275s">You</a> know, you can talk about the snowstorm all you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11212.177s">What's</a> a snowstorm have to do with somebody doing their job? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11215.57s">So</a> if there's an embargo on there because of a snowstorm, okay, nobody got your tickets?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11223.735s">I'm</a> saying, no tickets on the snow emergency, we understand, they gave tickets, whatever it is.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11725.41s">Mr.</a> President, it's quite obvious the Baker administration has done something a little bit different than the prior administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11731.934s">They're</a> holding cities and towns accountable, they're giving them deadlines, and they're indicating it's a use it or lose it program. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11738.118s">And</a> at the same time, with our council making the request <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11741.915s">the</a> administration take a million dollars out of free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11745.497s">This,</a> I think, works hand-in-glove with the street restoration program that I offered here some weeks back, that every single taxpayer in this community should identify their particular street, either by phone, by taking a picture, sending it in, and hopefully getting something that's time-stamped and dated, either from the clerk's office or from the Department of Public Works. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11765.528s">That</a> way, they are showing some authenticity as to what they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11769.787s">Again,</a> anyone who might be watching, news media that's out there, anyone that has a problem on their street, a crack, a road depression, a sidewalk or a curbing or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11782.853s">If</a> some damage took place during this past winter, take the picture, make a request, put it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11789.015s">And</a> I think that needs to be something that the city council should get a handle on as to how many requests came in and how is the city going to make its determination. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11798.433s">The</a> $143,000 is a limited amount, as we can tell, but I think it would be something that gets the ball rolling, knowing that we have that to start off with. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11806.156s">And</a> I know we have another million dollars, hopefully, that the mayor will go forward and expend for the purpose of the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11811.758s">There</a> isn't one street you can't go down that there is not a depression, a pothole, a sinkhole, or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11817.74s">Front</a> ends, cars, tires, and everything under the sun has been attacked this winter, unfortunately because of the storm. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11825.703s">It</a> is what it is, and that being the case, Mr. President, I move forward on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11830.306s">And</a> I like—we haven't gotten a report back, and I think we deserve a report back on the request that the Council made and to have an idea just what this administration intends to do over and beyond the $143,000, since, in fact, we asked for a million dollars to be taken out of free cash to be used for something that's desperately needed on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11850.26s">And</a> this is like a subject matter that I was talking about, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11854.056s">The</a> parking enforcement, you know, you could talk about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11857.878s">The</a> problems are still going to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11859.238s">But</a> this is something that's happening every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11861.339s">It's</a> in the face of the single taxpayer in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11864.501s">And</a> they don't deserve to have their streets turned into a battleground territory, unfortunately, because of what happened during the winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11872.784s">We</a> have a responsibility to these ratepayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11874.945s">They</a> pay taxes in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11876.626s">They</a> pay the salaries of everybody in this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11878.887s">And</a> they deserve their streets to be repaired.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12283.668s">This</a> one was jam-packed. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12285.309s">In</a> all the years that I've served, I've never seen so many people attend <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12291.502s">That</a> was really a heart-throbbing particular day. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12296.703s">But</a> I couldn't help but think when I looked up into that ceiling and I was hoping that that ceiling did not fall down. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12301.745s">That's</a> a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12303.425s">That's</a> been like that for almost two years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12306.706s">It's</a> patched. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12309.767s">You're</a> right, Councilor Dello Russo, the whole building is a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12312.428s">The</a> unfortunate part about it, this place was marred. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12315.589s">Mr.</a> President, will you get an answer on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12318.609s">Find</a> out, are they going to repair this or not? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12321.716s">You</a> know, this is the city, this is the people's chambers, and this has been two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12328.562s">The</a> top of the roof, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12330.884s">God,</a> I don't know what he's thinking on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12332.325s">Maybe</a> he just doesn't care what's going on, but there were people here that do care. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12335.688s">Madam</a> Vice President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12627.421s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12630.243s">Councilor</a> Penta wishes the records to be recorded as speaking as a member of the Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12635.665s">Municipal</a> Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12637.218s">Board</a> of Directors and not as a city councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12639.525s">If</a> you go to 17.22 on the tape, that's exactly what I said.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12649.902s">Well,</a> I want to be as exact as can be.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12718.61s">And</a> all I added on is was as a member of the Massachusetts Board of Directors and not as a city councilor, because that's exactly what I said. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12726.811s">17.22</a> into the minutes.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12748.401s">No,</a> no, no, no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12750.041s">No,</a> the action on the paper was actually to be to be advised <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12754.788s">And</a> to report back from the administration any plans to increase the charge of the plan for the employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12759.891s">So</a> there was action? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12761.351s">It</a> was a request, yeah, to get information.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12778.82s">You</a> know what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12784.924s">I</a> understand that, but my speaking, I wanted to be recorded as speaking as a member of the Mass Municipal Board of Directors and not as a city councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12792.889s">My</a> vote might have been a city councilor, but my speaking was not. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12797.612s">Whatever.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12823.717s">–</a> They support G.I.C., yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12825.359s">This</a> goes back to 2009, when this council voted on it, they talked about it, and they discussed it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12868.858s">If</a> it's an accurate reflection, then you get to watch the minutes of the meeting.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12873.58s">There's</a> a motion for approval on the record.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12938.206s">Not</a> asked to be recorded. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12940.267s">Wishes</a> to be recorded.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12958.956s">And</a> I said that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12959.516s">That's</a> exactly what I said that day.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12970.64s">You</a> have to read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12972.261s">Read</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12972.661s">Nobody's</a> reading the words. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12974.122s">You</a> have it, Mr. Clark. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12975.303s">What</a> are the words?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12988.971s">I'm</a> going by what you had last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12990.873s">It</a> says Councilor Penta wishes to be recorded. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12993.387s">speaking</a> as a member of the Mass Municipal Association.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1729.344s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1730.285s">Mr.</a> President and council colleagues, but more importantly, our subscribers within our community, we're dealing with the end of a 10 year contract that Comcast has had here with the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1742.091s">And</a> as everyone knows for the past few months, if not for the past, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1746.003s">a</a> couple of years in particular, this Medford City Council has been actively requesting more information, not only on Comcast, but also as it relates to our public access channels here in the city of Medford as to what's been going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1760.928s">Most</a> recently, and it's kind of like disturbing, there have been accounts coming out of the courthouses and all across the Commonwealth, but as it relates to public access channels. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1772.451s">For</a> example, there was a judge <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1774.733s">regarding</a> the Saugus Community Cable Television. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1777.455s">It</a> was now put a stop order against the Saugus Community Cable Television because of their refusal to allow the local board of selectmen to discuss certain aspects of public access and telecasting over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1794.084s">The</a> Attorney General's Office, just this past week, is now suing the Lynn Community Access Channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1800.307s">And</a> they're alleging that these defendants abused their positions of power <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1804.059s">and</a> were responsible for the misappropriation of charitable funds from this non-profit, said Attorney General Healy. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1810.523s">Actions</a> such as the ones alleged here cause financial harm to the charity and its mission and undermine the public's trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1817.267s">We</a> hope that through this action we can recover the money rightfully owed back to the charity, which is the non-profit, which happens to be the public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1824.852s">We</a> have here in the city of Medford, dating back to, I believe, July of last year, a multiple request of the Medford's TV3 public access channel <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1834.465s">who</a> supposedly filed a resolution of dissolution just past September. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1839.709s">But</a> it was our city solicitor who, at that point in time, sent us a huge packet of information demanding certain documents to be coming forward from the people who were managing the public access channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1852.38s">And</a> he gave them a time deadline for which they did not respond. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1855.662s">I</a> believe also, too, our city solicitor indicated that, I think it was either July or August of this past year, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1861.953s">that,</a> in fact, that if they did not respond, that he would pursue other legal avenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1868.058s">I</a> don't know what those avenues have been. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1869.699s">I</a> don't know if any of those avenues have taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1872.701s">But</a> we are now here in March of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1878.125s">I've</a> just received on my desk here right now tonight, I think we all did, a letter dated December 18, 2014, delivered to the Honorable Michael J. McGlynn from Thomas Kelly, director from Xfinity. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1892.555s">Last</a> paragraph, sentence in the last paragraph, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1895.897s">We</a> believe this renewal proposal substantially meets the community cable related needs while taking into account the cost to individual subscribers in accordance with section 626 B and C of the cable. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1907.203s">Best</a> part, the city has an obligation under the formal renewal process to either accept or deny Comcast proposal within four months or no later than April 18th. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1918.75s">We,</a> this has been in city hall since December 18th. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1922.62s">This</a> is now March 17th, with less than a month and a day to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1928.225s">And</a> we're just finding this out now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1931.427s">The</a> mayor, I believe, has a responsibility, as he did some 10 years ago, to have a public hearing allowing ratepayers, citizens, anybody who are proponents or opponents to the renewal of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1945.719s">We</a> have asked, I believe intimately, over the past few months, when is this contract renewal <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1951.58s">public</a> hearing going to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1953.861s">We</a> received no responses on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1955.461s">If</a> you go to page 26, and this is just a quick perusal to this thing, on the top it says, in the event that the issuing authority or other PEG access user elects not to fully program its channels with original PEG access programming, the licensee may reclaim any unused time on those channels. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1975.394s">Now,</a> I don't know where we're going with all of that, but that tells me that if the mayor of this community refuses or so chooses not to engage public access anymore in this community, that in fact, Comcast can take over that Channel 3 and do whatever it wants, and the city would not be able to get monies that they have in the past on public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1998.462s">Looking</a> at this real quick, I could be wrong, but I think that's the way it reads. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2002.104s">Also,</a> and more importantly, why would we even want to engage in another 10-year contract? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2007.446s">Look</a> what's happened with our rubbish contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2009.808s">We're</a> engaged with them for 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2011.568s">We</a> just got embroiled with a ridiculous 10-year kiosk program here in the city, you know, a meter program. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2017.992s">And</a> now we're looking at a renewal to a <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2021.213s">public</a> acts strike that to a cable contract for 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2025.175s">But</a> the difference on this cable contract from the last one is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2028.496s">The</a> technology has become so advanced out there right now that we really don't know within the next 10 years if new technology can supersede that for which Comcast is giving to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2040.401s">My</a> advice would be, and since the mayor is obviously not having his public hearing, I have no idea why. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2045.743s">He</a> has got one month and one day to pull this off, which is a <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2049.303s">period</a> of time to get intelligent people down here to talk about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2052.926s">But</a> rather than go forward with a 10-year contract, I would probably make a recommendation that we have a three-year contract, with a two-year contract possible for renewal, at that point in time, just to see where we're going with all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2065.897s">It</a> makes no sense to say, yes, we're going forward for 10 years, when you're not having a public meeting and a public forum, for which I believe—I'm not—don't hold me to it, but I believe that that was part of the licensing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2078.217s">and</a> the relicensing process. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2080.537s">And,</a> you know, unfortunately, just getting this tonight and trying to peruse it, I mean, that's one part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2085.918s">The</a> other part of it is we haven't still gotten any accounting of monies allegedly not found or misappropriated or what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2095.2s">We</a> haven't gotten a full accounting of the inventory that was down there, if it's been sold, if it's been used or what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2104.261s">And</a> here we are engaging ourselves, if this be the case, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2107.738s">with</a> a potential 10-year contract, and then looking at surrounding cities and towns where not only the attorney general has stepped in, but you also have it with Lynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2116.582s">You</a> have it in Saugus. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2117.862s">You</a> have it in Bolton. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2119.363s">And</a> you have it in Rehoboth, where the guy got eight years, eight years in jail for misappropriating funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2126.066s">You</a> have problems with Wincambe and Winchester. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2129.598s">These</a> are things that are just surrounding us. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2131.241s">And</a> we're living right in the middle of all of this right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2134.306s">And</a> we can't get answers to satisfy what we have, never mind going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2138.953s">So</a> I look at this as a three-pronged approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2140.776s">Number</a> one. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2141.86s">We</a> have no public hearing for which I think we should have. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2144.341s">Number</a> two, we still don't even have anything resolved as TV3 and the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2149.762s">Accountability</a> not only from inventory, accountability from records and for tax filings, for bank accounts and who's on them and who's allowed to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2161.505s">And</a> also, getting involved with a 10-year contract that's right around the corner, I don't think it would serve the rate payers of this community well. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2169.387s">I</a> think it would serve them a lot better <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2171.144s">if</a> they had an opportunity to maybe have a three-year contract with a two-year renewal, if that be the case, to see where we're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2176.849s">The</a> state and the art of technology is so advanced today that who knows where we're going to be able to be at that point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2182.653s">And</a> if we get locked into something that we can't get out of, it might cost subscribers more money in the years 7, 8, 9, and 10, or 6, or whatever it might be, than what they could possibly get with a more advanced contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2195.424s">It</a> shocks me how this city just runs itself with these 10-year contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2199.828s">And</a> nobody is looking for a 10-year contract other than Comcast and the mayor of this community who is allowing this to go forward without even having a public hearing to have any kind of a discussion on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2211.074s">Some</a> two weeks, I think it was two weeks ago this past Monday, going two and a half weeks ago, I spoke with the attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2216.056s">He</a> was representing the city of Medford on their public access information and legalese stuff, whatever it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2225.241s">He</a> told me as of two, two and a half weeks ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2227.315s">He</a> has had absolutely no contact with the City of Medford on its renewal with Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2232.337s">So</a> I don't know where we're going with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2234.157s">I</a> don't think anyone behind this reel knows where we're going with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2236.918s">But</a> I really think that we need to send a message to the mayor and behalf of the subscribers that something needs to stop on the tracks and we don't need another 10-year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2246.001s">I</a> think we need to have a real look and see, a public hearing, and have some open and public discussion.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2346.896s">In</a> the second paragraph, it says that the city is getting $350,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2349.738s">I</a> believe the prior contract, the city got $450,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2353.741s">Rick?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2354.522s">So</a> we're going down $75,000 on what they're going to give us. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2360.826s">They're</a> looking for another 10-year contract, and we don't even know what the hell we're getting.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2494.18s">Rick,</a> I think the question that you're really wanting to ask, by what law are we required to sign to approve a 10-year contract? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2503.963s">That,</a> I think, needs to be the question rather than— Let me say, because what happens after April 18th?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4175.343s">Just</a> rescind the renewal period until such time... No, we can't rescind the renewal.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4225.442s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4227.303s">To</a> you, Councilor Camuso, I hear what you want to do, and it sounds like it's a good idea, but this is a renewal, and I don't have anything in front of me that says that a renewal becomes automatic by the mayor, because if that's the case, what are we even discussing anything? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4240.513s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4241.593s">Also,</a> in one of the pages that we were received here, you know, there's a whole list of <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4246.921s">what</a> the peg access provider needs to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4249.403s">It's</a> different than the original contract, or it's an addendum to the original contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4253.446s">So</a> that in and of itself talks about being different. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4256.628s">Mr.</a> Clerk, not to put you on the hot seat, but the only thing that disturbs me with this whole thing is it says CC here, City Clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4263.894s">Do</a> you ever remember getting this, December 18th?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4307.47s">Let</a> me finish my comment, please.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4310.69s">So</a> wait a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4311.11s">It</a> goes to the same point. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4312.571s">So</a> we heard the clerk say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4314.531s">But</a> if this has been sitting there since December 18th, because it definitely went to the mayor, and it did go by UPS, and somebody upstairs in his office, and now we're a month and a day away from the four months. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4324.853s">Something's</a> going on because there's no public hearing being held or anything.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4346.592s">Well,</a> point of clarification, Mr. President, the city clerk is aware of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4349.835s">He</a> just got through explaining to you how and why it got there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4352.71s">It's</a> a document that CCs the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4355.331s">It's</a> addressed to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4356.692s">It's</a> regarding a renewal process for which we're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4359.894s">So</a> this is a very important issue.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4439.485s">Now,</a> wait a minute.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4468.727s">Also,</a> can we amend that for it?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4474.19s">Can</a> I move to Councilor, I want to amend his paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4477.753s">Councilor</a> Camuso.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4481.615s">Councilor</a> Camuso, on your paper, can we amend that one step further as it relates to, you want the city solicitor, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4489.789s">likewise</a> to report back. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4491.269s">But</a> at the same time, remember, Comcast used to be Time Warner, and before Time Warner was another one. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4497.89s">So</a> we have an interloping of three different cable providers here in the city during that period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4505.012s">And</a> I think when you change from A to B, that's going to cut the thing to Time Warner. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4510.733s">Also,</a> I'd like to amend it to ask the question, when and if the public hearing is going to take place on this renewal? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4519.526s">So</a> amended by Councilor Penta.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4730.072s">Well,</a> I'm sorry.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4732.213s">Move</a> to rescind, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4733.353s">Last</a> vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4733.793s">He</a> can move to rescind all he wants.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4741.016s">So</a> you're going to tell me I can't speak on the motion now?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4780.37s">Well,</a> you didn't even let me finish the reason why I just said before that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4787.072s">No,</a> no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4787.652s">He's</a> so quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4788.192s">He</a> thinks he can read my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4789.393s">Let</a> him take his vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4793.074s">I'm</a> not out after you at all.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4848.922s">No,</a> listen, no, because he thought he was so smart. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4851.383s">He</a> knew what he was going to do.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4889.793s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4892.174s">Since</a> last week, I received, I think it was 14 phone calls from folks who thought this was a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4897.176s">I</a> believe that they have spoken to some folks in the highway department who also thought it was a good idea, which would be helpful to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4904.282s">Subsequent</a> to last week, and I want to thank our city clerk, Mr. Finn, he sent me in a direction that brought me to a town in Florida, Jacksonville, Florida, that engaged in something quite similar, not exactly the same, but quite similar as it relates to groups of citizens getting together within the community, finding storefronts, vacant spots, spots that need to be rehabilitated, going to the landowners and to the city and working out deals as it relates to, once again, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4933.972s">bringing</a> their streets back to life. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4936.835s">This</a> whole idea of the street recovery program includes curbing, the lights, paneled sidewalks, and parts of the city and parts of the sections of the business districts that are just not getting any life at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4952.628s">It's</a> a master plan that I believe should work hand in hand with the new Department of Public Works building that we're having built for $15 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4961.634s">Also,</a> at the same time, it's, I won't call it an adjunct, but it runs itself similar to the Mass Department of Public Transportation on their new Mass Highway Street Identifying Program, where I think they're up to over 300 folks who either sent in pitches or sent in locations where there are potholes on the major highways here of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4982.191s">So</a> I think it's a catch that we can take advantage of. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4986.534s">Like</a> I said, it's something that seems to be getting good response. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4993.474s">On</a> another issue, liking to this, in downtown Medford Square, in the heart of your business district, you have five lights out within, five street lights out, in the major part of your downtown area, and they've been out for almost three to four weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5008.96s">I</a> mean, you're not gonna have people come in, I don't know what the mayor can't see on a daily basis, but when you let your street lights out, you're losing visibility, number one, but you're presenting a public safety matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5020.304s">And</a> this is something that it's inherent in this whole idea <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5023.441s">of</a> the Street Recovery Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5025.423s">And</a> bringing it up for the 14th time, I will bring it up, and that's the parking lot behind St. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5029.926s">Joseph's</a> Church on Route 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5031.968s">No</a> lights, a definite public safety problem, and it doesn't offer anything for the people of this community after five o'clock at night when it gets dark. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5039.534s">Now</a> it's a little bit lighter, but all winter long, and as I explained before, we had a couple of incidences over the year where there was a drug deal that went on in one situation, another lady got afraid to go to her car because there were people in the parking lot, and still nothing has taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5053.084s">We've</a> been told by the city that they're responsible for it for the five years that they have the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5057.747s">I</a> believe the contract is up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5059.288s">I</a> don't know what's going on after that, but again, it's a public safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5062.55s">But</a> I just want to bring attention to the fact that again, I want to thank Mr. Finn. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5067.533s">Uh,</a> you sent me in a direction that sent me in a further direction, uh, which has been very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5071.636s">I'll</a> just continue to bring on more and more information. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5074.098s">And</a> I would hope that the mayor takes advantage of this and jumps on board with this because the citizen road recovery program, you can go down any street in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5081.511s">every</a> major pothole that's taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5084.912s">And</a> Department of Public Works folks, I mean, they can't see every pothole because it's obvious, there's a lot of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5089.993s">But</a> the people of this community, there's 57, 58,000 of you, you could be the eyes and ears of every street, every corner, every sidewalk, every light, every manhole cover, whatever it might be out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5099.755s">It</a> would make a great inventory to start with for the Department of Public Works to go forward and take back and rejuvenate these city streets and sidewalks that are just in desperate need of repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5110.138s">So</a> I just wanted to, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5111.488s">bring</a> that to the attention of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5116.051s">Well,</a> that's part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5116.991s">The</a> other thing is the mayor going to respond back on this, because if he's not going to do it, I think it's another issue that the council needs to address.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5140.817s">Mr.</a> President, not since I believe, I think it was, I see somebody from the audience sitting over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5145.881s">I</a> think it was in either January or February last year when we met, is the last time we had any discussion on this issue of the Craddock Bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5153.727s">We've</a> received no updates from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5159.511s">And</a> now from what the reference, and I have a whole folder here, and from what I understand, and this is just scuttlebutt because I haven't gotten it from anybody, what was supposed to have been started last fall is not happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5170.666s">was</a> supposed to be starting this spring, and it's right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5173.908s">It's</a> not happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5175.108s">And</a> nobody has any idea when this Kratik Bridge is going to see any kind of resurrection or what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5180.871s">But</a> taking that also into consideration, this idea that it would take over a year to remove or to move all the underground conduits that represent telephone lines, electricity, and everything, that's kind of hard to believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5195.458s">Because</a> when you speak to other engineers in other cities and towns, and you explain this to them, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5199.93s">They</a> just can't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5201.23s">I</a> mean, with the technology that's out there today, why does it have to take a year? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5205.332s">But</a> not only that, this bridge has been there for well over 100 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5208.453s">It's</a> not sinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5210.174s">So</a> I guess the better question is, why do we have to get ourselves even involved? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5214.035s">And</a> it's now up to over a $13 million bridge as of last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5218.737s">For</a> maybe the bridge just needs a pavement, a reconstruction on the top portion of it, rather than going through this multi-million dollar extravaganza. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5227.639s">The</a> businesses in Medford Square cannot handle another setback and an opportunity to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5233.644s">Bad</a> enough, there's no reason for anyone to want to come to Medford Square at nighttime, other than two restaurants. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5241.111s">Name</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5242.012s">There's</a> no bookstore, that's gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5243.353s">There's</a> no movie theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5244.374s">There's</a> nothing there for the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5246.336s">There's</a> no arts and crafts that are taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5249.279s">It's</a> a professional office community in downtown Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5253.805s">And</a> banks, and banks, excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5255.787s">Banks,</a> pizza parlors, and hairdressers. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5257.509s">But</a> they all close at nighttime. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5259.893s">So,</a> you know, we talk about rejuvenating Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5262.835s">Under</a> this administration, he's talked about it three times, and three times, this is what you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5268.058s">Stores</a> that are continuously being empty, nothing that fosters good growth and good development, and there's absolutely no diversity in the type of businesses that are in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5277.103s">And</a> now we're still dealing with the bridge that have people still concerned that if the bridge goes in, what happens to their business, or how is it going to affect traffic, the public safety, and the bridge that's on the Route 9. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5288.69s">You</a> know, here's another thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5289.939s">When</a> you go to Medford Square on Main Street, the overpass there, the lights are all out. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5294.401s">They're</a> down to one light. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5296.542s">There</a> used to be six lights, and they're all out. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5298.883s">You</a> call up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5299.783s">It's</a> not us. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5300.463s">Call</a> the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5301.044s">The</a> city says it's the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5302.424s">The</a> state says it's DCR. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5304.085s">I</a> don't know whose responsibility it is, but it's a public safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5307.326s">And</a> as this continues to go on, the Craddock Bridge seems to be the culprit, so to speak, because everything revolves around what's going to come out of the Craddock Bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5315.89s">All</a> kinds of monies are supposedly tied into the Craddock Bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5319.658s">Mr.</a> President, I think we need a response back from the Commonwealth of Mass, not from the mayor, not from any other politician, from the Commonwealth of Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5328.505s">It's</a> on their agenda to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5330.486s">We</a> need to know, and I think all the businesses need to know, when they're coming into the city and they're going to begin business.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5413.509s">Mr.</a> President, I guess it's now starting to escalate to the point that people are willing to acknowledge what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5424.059s">Today,</a> having an at length conversation with Medford Pediatrics and Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5429.057s">and</a> with a three and a half page memo that was sent to me by the employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5433.359s">And</a> I have the names that they are acknowledged and are willing to have made public. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5438.541s">These</a> are people who come there with their children. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5440.941s">These</a> are senior citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5442.062s">This</a> is the doctor that runs the place that's in charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5444.983s">Excuse</a> me, this is the nurse who's in charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5447.984s">It's</a> just an ongoing saga that just took place over the past couple of days, starting off with a senior citizen, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5456.4s">A</a> husband and a wife went there and they were just so upset as to how to handle the kiosk that they had to come into the office of Medford Pediatrics to get some help as it relates to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5468.683s">Also,</a> I believe somebody from Medford Pediatrics made a request to the mayor concerning some of the concerns that they had and they never got a response back from the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5478.569s">Also,</a> parents having to go back. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5480.53s">We</a> have a situation here where a lady came in with a stroller and with her kids, not realizing that the kiosks were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5486.754s">We</a> have pictures here that the kiosks were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5489.756s">And</a> recognizing that the kiosks were there, she had to go back out and she had to leave her kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5494.44s">And</a> while the kid was in the, as everybody knows, if you have a little child, especially at a young age, the kid was screaming and yelling. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5500.243s">The</a> kid didn't want the mother to leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5502.445s">And</a> unfortunately she winds up getting a ticket, not knowing that she had to go back out there and put the money into the kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5507.74s">Then</a> we have another situation where the people who put the change in didn't have an exchange, and they had no credit card. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5516.706s">They</a> always came paid by a check, not knowing that the kiosks were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5521.569s">So</a> having no money to put either change or whatever, they had to go, once again, ask the people in the method pediatrics if we could have some change to go out there for which they were <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5535.51s">gracious</a> enough to do, but at the same time, unfortunately, once again, they got a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5540.152s">And</a> by the way, the gentleman in the little white car that goes into that pocket, and by all of these people, have been represented as being very rude to the people and their concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5550.255s">Also,</a> today, I believe, mother's name is Kim Ruane, not accepting coins, and that was giving out the wrong receipts. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5558.878s">So</a> as she went in and put her money in, another lady came in, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5563.886s">not</a> realizing that she had to put the money in, and then she did put the money in, but the receipt was not the right receipt with the right registration for the right person.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5585.076s">Mystic</a> Valley, I'm sorry, Mystic Valley Pediatrics. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5587.297s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5587.637s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5590.263s">They</a> were given the wrong receipts after they put in the right number. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5593.564s">Then</a> there was a lady who parked her car on, where is this one here? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5598.565s">Okay,</a> here was a car, she pulled up to the spot, and once she pulled up to the spot, she was going to get out of the car and to go to the kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5607.186s">And</a> the guy was giving her a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5610.367s">Okay,</a> and she said, I'm going to the kiosk to put the money in, and she got the ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5616.288s">And</a> not only did she get the ticket, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5620.09s">She</a> put the money in the ticket, and she came back, and she says, look it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5623.473s">He</a> grabbed the receipt from her and gave her another ticket because there was no money. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5628.056s">Because</a> look it, that's the wrong registration on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5630.618s">Because</a> he probably thought, for whatever it might be, she was lying, or whatever it could be. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5635.262s">So</a> she winds up getting two tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5637.103s">And</a> this seems to be symptomatic for three people. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5639.525s">Then</a> another lady in Mystic Valley Pediatrics went in after her, showed her receipt, and the receipt had her registration number on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5648.152s">This</a> is not making any sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5650.068s">There's</a> a dentist in Medford Square where a person went in to have some work done in the dentist shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5654.271s">And</a> while they're in the dentist shop, one of the ladies that were in there said, I have to leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5658.535s">What</a> do you mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5659.135s">I</a> was an employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5660.356s">I</a> have to leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5661.157s">I</a> have to go put money in the meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5662.718s">It</a> was just around lunchtime. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5663.859s">I</a> have to go put money in the meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5665.7s">She</a> goes out putting money in the meter, and she left the poor dentist in the shop with a lady sitting on the chair that she had to get another secretary to come in and help her out. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5676.22s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5678.222s">This</a> is not making any sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5680.163s">It's</a> a whole bunch of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5683.446s">No,</a> these people are coming forward, and what they're upset about is that they addressed this to the mayor's office with absolutely no response, and that's just plain rudeness, whether you agree to disagree to the whole nine yards. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5696.857s">I</a> just don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5699.219s">As</a> we continue to go, and here's the pictures of the parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5704.634s">against</a> the wall where Mystic Valley Pediatric Center, you have these two kiosks, and you have people parked almost 250 feet away who are basically coming here maybe for the first time, not even knowing what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5717.517s">We</a> do have a sighting section. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5719.258s">Again,</a> another violation of the contract on page 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5723.79s">It</a> says, operators' vehicles, the rear of all vehicles shall have a sign warning of frequent vehicle stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5732.016s">Here</a> we are again this week with the location, same truck, same vehicle, in the square, and no sign on the back making stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5743.304s">This</a> is a clear violation of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5745.405s">We've</a> got it now three weeks in a row with pitches. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5748.627s">I</a> don't know what the mayor thinks that <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5750.089s">This</a> is great that he thinks this Republic company from Tennessee is doing a wonderful job, but I don't think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5755.452s">And</a> if you're starting to get people like this from Mystic Valley Pediatrics willing to come forward and use their names and they're not afraid of it because they're upset and they're really PO'd that the mayor would be disrespectful not even to respond, that's starting to tell the story and it's starting to escalate throughout this entire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5771.839s">And</a> I would hope that anyone who has a concern about this keeps on bringing them in, keeps on expressing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5778.189s">You</a> know, how do you put your money into the machine, and how do you get the wrong number to come out? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5782.53s">And</a> I think it was a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday, somebody put money in the machine, and they got more money back than what they put in. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5790.392s">So</a> where's that meter at, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5800.435s">Well,</a> you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5803.257s">Whether</a> you're for it or against it, it's that one lady who wanted to do what she thought was the right thing to do—it's probably going on three weeks now—went to Medford Square, went to go put the money in the meter, fell on the bank, and got rushed to the emergency room in the Lawrence Memorial by ambulance because she didn't want to get the ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5819.85s">To</a> me, that, to me, is the whole story. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5822.432s">This</a> is more than the whole story, but this is just symptomatic as to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5827.135s">Councilor</a> Caraviello, you said 60 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5828.977s">The</a> 60 days, I believe, is up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5830.963s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5831.823s">I</a> don't know where the report is, but I can tell you this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5834.684s">I</a> know what I'm going to do once that 60 days comes in. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5837.504s">So,</a> apparently, they have no respect for the resolution of the Council ER request. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5841.945s">This</a> is now the 17th, and, you know, this isn't me talking. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5847.407s">This</a> is all information that can be backed up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5849.427s">I</a> mean, it's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5853.068s">What</a> can I tell you? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5855.515s">It's</a> anti-business, and if this is what Mayor McGlynn wants, to tax the people to death with another bogus tax the people, beside everything else, that's a damn shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5869.259s">Yeah,</a> my resolution is that, number one, I would like to have Councilor Caraviello's resolution of the first 60 days reported back as to revenues, and I think also, I think they need to come back and reappear before us, Republic, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5884.16s">As</a> to what all these inconsistencies and these happenings, I mean, how are they going to address them?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5898.614s">Yeah,</a> I got no problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5900.196s">And</a> also the fact that you have a violation of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5902.825s">The</a> cars are still not properly identified, as the contract says it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5907.549s">Also,</a> I believe you have people that will call up and tell you that they're getting tickets for parking on permit streets that still haven't even been identified by Republic as being updated and corrected.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_EHumvCHQbJg/2025-03-21_EHumvCHQbJg.html">Medford City Council - March 10, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=81.22s">Mr.</a> President, um, I think during this past winter season, we've all seen, um, the problems that exist not only here in the city of Medford, but out throughout the entire Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=93.409s">And</a> as a result of that, and after speaking with the folks at the, uh, Massachusetts department of transportation and going online and reviewing some things across the country, as it relates to <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=105.038s">streets</a> and neighborhoods, sidewalks, curbs, and a whole host of things, where the money might be coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=115.422s">And</a> after noticing that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts just had this new identification program implemented, asking people on any state roadways, if you see something that's dangerous, please take a picture, send it in, and identify a particular location. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=131.188s">It</a> gave me the idea that here in the city of Medford, it doesn't take a genius to figure this out. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=135.611s">Just</a> drive down any street in the city of Medford and you have potholes all over the place and desperate need to be filled, you know, potential damage just waiting to happen on any car or truck that may be driving down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=149.72s">But</a> that also leads to another host of issues as it relates to the good weather and the good times and how are we going to handle certain things such as <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=159.896s">Um,</a> viruses that seem to be emanating, um, from certain drains and soil systems, um, as the West Nile virus has presented itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=170.338s">Um,</a> the Commonwealth of Massachusetts ran a survey last year of the 351 cities and towns, um, for which 229 of them responded on a major road survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=183.181s">And</a> unfortunately, and I don't know why the city of Medford did not respond to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=187.965s">And</a> this was in regards to Chapter 90 roadway funds that could be used for local communities had they sent in a description of what their needs might be for Chapter 90 roadway needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=202.558s">And</a> it comes especially in light of the fact that this administration, Governor's administration, Charlie Baker, has made a commitment to Chapter 90 roadway funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=211.866s">But</a> unfortunately, where the city of Medford falls in this, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=216.114s">They</a> didn't do the survey, and the survey methodology wasn't complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=220.798s">It</a> was complete for 229 cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=224.56s">We</a> have here in the city of Medford a brand new building for which we are spending approximately $15 million for a new Department of Public Works building. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=232.987s">And</a> in that Department of Public Works building, it would be hoped that we would have the men, the equipment, and the wherewithal to handle all the things necessary to look at our streets here in the city of Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=246.084s">and</a> as we continue to go forward and into the future, making our city better than what it has been and what it could be. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=254.167s">As</a> a result of that, I'm going to be asking in a two-part layered program that if anybody out there, whether you're on your own street or you see a city street, private way, and you have a concern because of a pothole, take the picture of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=272.513s">Take</a> the picture of it, ID it, <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=274.653s">send</a> it in to the city clerk's office or the Department of Public Works, where you would at least get a, hopefully a system would be set up. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=286.179s">You</a> would get something that would be timed, dated and stamped and identified as to where the location might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=292.423s">This</a> could also be representative of if your street is in desperate need of repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=297.906s">This</a> is also in regards to when NSTAR and any other utility comes into the community, digs up a street, <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=304.36s">And</a> six months or a year after the fact, there's a big concave in the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=307.421s">There's</a> a hole in the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=308.882s">And</a> that hasn't been addressed, and it doesn't take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=311.242s">And</a> that turns out to be a hole in the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=315.084s">I</a> think when you're asking the taxpayers of this community to recognize $15 million is now being put into a new public works building, I think you should also be asking that issues such as this need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=327.708s">And</a> they shouldn't be put on a burner saying, we don't have enough money to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=330.769s">We</a> don't have the equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=332.036s">or</a> we don't have the men to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=333.736s">I</a> think we need to stop looking at where we're going with this type of rehabilitation that's needed here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=341.358s">A</a> most recent law passed by the state legislature will now allow sewer systems and drainage systems to have lava sides be placed into their drainage systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=354.061s">Lava</a> sides would be something that will be able to address Westphalia <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=358.323s">West</a> Nile virus and any other potential that might be out there that has been out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=362.706s">In</a> the past, um, that has not been allowed because of, I believe the pesticide content that might be, have an environmental impact, but because of this inbreeding and the extension or the acceleration of, of West Nile virus and other, and other issues related to that, um, this year, um, department of public works, um, and city engineers, um, will be allowed to use lavisides into these particular locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=387.943s">We</a> have in excess of $6.5 million in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=391.665s">I</a> would hope that approximately $1 million of that money would be used to get into this city restoration street program. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=400.23s">We</a> all know that some monies may not be all, but some monies will be coming back from the federal government because of these storms. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=407.134s">I</a> believe it's a two-phase application from MEMA. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=412.097s">And</a> as a result of that, I believe <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=414.99s">The</a> state administration feels comfortable approximately 35% of that, if not more, will be forthcoming on the first round, not knowing if they're going to accept the second round, having it to be identified as an emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=427.293s">And</a> hopefully it will be identified. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=429.034s">This</a> is the first time in many, many years the weather has done what it has to the Northeast region in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=434.735s">So</a> taking that into consideration and also recognizing that the new MS-4 permit that we talked about last week <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=441.19s">is</a> now a real bone of contention. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=443.672s">I</a> went to a meeting last week up on Beacon Hill, where the Mass Water Resource, not MWRA, the Mass Water Resource Association, which comprised about six individuals that deal with water and sewage and drainage and EPA requirements, are on board with this because they know that the cost, which is going to be anywhere from $800,000 plus per each community to implement an MS4 system, <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=469.568s">is</a> also going to have an impact on roadways and sidewalks and streets, curbings and machinery. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=476.03s">They're</a> asking not only for a delay to this, but they're also asking, as we had asked last week, our city engineer, to ask a pushback in an educational program for educating not only our community, but all the communities, of what this is going to entail and the cost impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=491.395s">We</a> know also on an annual basis that we have approximately a million dollars or thereabouts that comes back each and every year <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=498.723s">on</a> our budget because of expenditures that don't take place, excise tax revenues, and a whole host of other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=505.185s">So</a> I think our commitment should be upfront relative to doing the streets and the potholes and doing them correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=513.627s">There</a> are ways of doing it rather than just getting a shovel and taking it off the back of the truck and throwing it into a hole and let somebody drive over it, as compared to taking the time, putting it down, pounding it in, and making sure it's going to stay there for a reasonable period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=528.527s">Some</a> streets are going to just need to be done completely all over. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=531.47s">And</a> I think one of the things, and I think this council has addressed it on numerous occasions, we keep giving licenses to NSTAR for whether it's gas or electric, whatever the diggings of the streets might be up. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=542.077s">And</a> I believe we have a $10,000, I think that's it, Mr. Clark, isn't it a $10,000 bond that they have to put up? <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=547.521s">I</a> think we really need to start holding these accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=550.403s">I</a> believe the last time that one of the utilities came here, we asked that it go back in six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=555.687s">And</a> if not, we were going to take that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=557.57s">So</a> we have the mechanisms, we have the avenues to do this, but I think this not only bodes well for our community, I think it puts ourselves in the right direction, because all the streets in our city are in desperate need of repair, and some shape, manner, and form. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=571.019s">So</a> in essence, in a nutshell, it basically is asking any person in the community to go out there, whatever you see that you might think is a hazard, take the picture of it, or if you don't wanna take the picture and you can't, make a phone call, either to the clerk's office or the highway department, and hopefully they'll set up some kind of <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=587.223s">a</a> situation where you call on a particular day, you get a number, and that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=591.265s">It</a> goes to the highway department, and they start addressing that this spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=594.846s">It</a> would be a shame to have the city administration say, we don't either have the equipment or the personnel to handle this, because that's not what they voted for when they voted for a $15 million building to upgrade the Department of Public Works, who claimed, or the city claimed, hasn't been upgraded in years, and they were working in a substandard building. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=612.913s">We</a> need to understand that if we're going to be paying monies to upgrade buildings <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=617.288s">and</a> refurbish them or whatever we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=619.149s">We</a> need to have the equipment, the men and the tools to go with it, to handle what our city needs might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=623.891s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I move the question, ask for a roll call vote

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=962.518s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=965.08s">On</a> that matter, from my understanding, the first — Point of information, counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=969.443s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=969.823s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=970.824s">There</a> were four snowstorms that we're dealing with. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=972.626s">I</a> think what the state is trying to do is put the first three in together because of its closeness in time and calling that the major storm. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=979.941s">If,</a> in fact, that goes through, a larger portion of federal monies will come back to the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=984.743s">If</a> they take them separately or individually, it'll be a lesser portion, and each will have to be argued. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=989.845s">There</a> are two avenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=991.146s">You're</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=991.746s">One</a> is for snow, and one is for potholes. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=994.467s">It's</a> a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=995.187s">It's</a> the second priority on the agenda of the Baker administration, so I'm quite sure you're going to see something come out of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1000.57s">We'll</a> see some action. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1001.47s">Councilor</a> Marks.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1469.559s">Councilor</a> Naylor, maybe I'm confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1472.179s">Are</a> you talking about side streets or off main streets?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1505.873s">I've</a> got no problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1506.874s">I</a> think I'd like to just divide that into two parts. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1509.516s">The</a> first one, we've had construction companies and utility companies dig up our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1514.74s">And</a> if the cost has to be attributed to them, and maybe we should, again, getting back to, as compared to the legitimate cost of a city street, maybe just break it down in two ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1523.38s">That</a> which and how the city's been dug up, it's caused the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1526.783s">And</a> if it's a legitimate city street that we own outright with no other interference from an outside vendor, be it an instar or a contractor, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1534.29s">And</a> I think we'll get a better handle of what the true cost would be.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1568.885s">That's</a> part of the key. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1569.545s">And</a> the other part of the key is going back to a council of marks of literature, <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1572.45s">I</a> mean, if we're building this new building, and we don't have the equipment, and we don't have the men, or whatever it might be, we probably need to be looking at something that's going to cost us a few more dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1582.495s">And</a> that's what our free cash is for. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1584.316s">You</a> know, they have a special machine that's called a pothole pounder. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1587.338s">I</a> don't know if anyone's ever seen it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1588.859s">It</a> comes out of the Midwestern part of the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1590.96s">And</a> what they do is they go up and down the streets, and in the middle of the truck, where <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1597.583s">where</a> the hot tub is, it's hot, it goes into the ground, and then the pound, it just goes down, ba-boom, ba-boom, like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1603.166s">And</a> it's perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1604.246s">And</a> it goes ba-boom, ba-boom. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1606.788s">It</a> pounds itself right in. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1608.468s">And</a> it might cost a few thousand, $100,000, a couple of hundred thousand, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1612.91s">But</a> you're looking at the long-term effect of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1616.352s">And</a> that's what the whole thing is. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1617.813s">We're</a> not looking for 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1618.573s">Yeah,</a> right, we could borrow it to see how it works.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2051.215s">I'd</a> like to make a point of, just a point of correction. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2057.539s">I</a> believe in, and when I gave my comments regarding the street recovery program, it was the Mass Municipal Association that ran <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2065.146s">the</a> survey for the Commonwealth of Mass of the 229 cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2069.527s">I</a> may have missaid that wrong, but that's, that's who did it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2073.127s">So</a> I just want to let you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2074.848s">And</a> that's how they presented their chapter 90 budget because of the input that mass municipal gave to the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2079.789s">And</a> that's how they presented it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2081.189s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2623.977s">On</a> that subject matter, I believe it was one of the topics that was brought up today at the Traffic Commission meeting this afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2630.66s">I'm</a> going to make a request on these boards and these commission meetings, just as an aside. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2635.282s">There</a> are a lot of people who would have liked to have attended, but they can't go at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2639.453s">you</a> know, either that or televise it or what have you, but to have it in an afternoon and knowing how important of an issue this is, and now as it is escalating into another part of the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2652.301s">Also,</a> from last week to this week, once again, I happened to, again, have contact with people, especially in the West Method area, and I think they were the majority of the people at the meeting today, voicing not only their concerns but their objections to this whole kiosk program and how it's hurting their business. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2669.936s">Um,</a> and they can say whatever they want when the mayor makes the comment, he hasn't received one complaint. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2675.158s">Well,</a> they know that that's not true because either they've either called or they couldn't get through or that's nothing but good PR for what he wants to believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2684.02s">Um,</a> as of March 5th of this week, and once again, we have pitches of this wonderful Republic truck from Tennessee going out and according to page 11 of the contract, it states in <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2699.962s">Operator's</a> Vehicles Part B, the rear of all vehicles shall have a sign warning of frequent stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2705.446s">There's</a> no sign indicating frequent stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2710.209s">I</a> don't know, each and every week, this has been going on since January, what does it take for this company, more importantly, what does it take for this man to understand that this company from Tennessee is just not doing what it's supposed to be doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2721.856s">It's</a> not honoring the contract, and it's not working out to the best of abilities for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2728.536s">Councilor</a> Marks, you asked, I think it was two weeks ago, when does 8-6 start? <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2733.28s">Has</a> anybody gotten that answer yet? <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2735.861s">They</a> passed it today. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2737.142s">So</a> 8-6 becomes effective when? <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2740.965s">So</a> if that's the case, then when does the three-hour parking in the municipal lots go up? <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2745.569s">And</a> when do all the signs that are bolted to the trees around the city, when do those things change? <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2751.873s">You</a> know, there's a whole host of issues that revolve around this, and I'm not so <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2756.371s">I'll</a> say it again, and as I said it before, I just think the whole thing is anti-business. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2759.954s">I</a> don't think it serves any purpose of doing anything to enhance business here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2766.04s">The</a> complaints are just too numerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2768.222s">One</a> lady in particular, unfortunately, two weeks ago or thereabouts, if not longer, falling down, trying to put money in a kiosk, getting rushed to a hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2776.309s">They</a> parking in front of meters and hydrants, they can violate the law and they have to be told not to. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2781.768s">And</a> once again, you're right, Gene, you have to tell the chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2783.829s">The</a> chief has to go and tell them. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2785.21s">These</a> people know what the rules are and whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2788.052s">And</a> I think we're getting pretty close to the point that I think I probably would be moving pretty soon that we just end this contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2794.936s">It'll</a> be the best approximately $900,000 this city could spend to get rid of this company and then stick your head to the grindstone and figure out an enforcement program that makes sense here in the city of Medford, hiring people on a part-time basis, <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2808.952s">And</a> I think people would acknowledge that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2810.672s">Or,</a> and the alternative, as Councilor Camuso, you alluded to it in the beginning, if they put meters out there in the beginning, people would have understood it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2817.674s">They</a> would understand seeing a meter, putting the money in the meter, and so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2820.695s">But</a> it's too discombobulated. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2822.235s">There</a> is no uniformity. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2824.255s">When</a> they thought they were going to make a clean killing on Playstead Road from people from Winchester parking all day there for $5 a day, <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2831.507s">There's</a> nobody there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2832.267s">Not</a> one car. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2833.708s">There's</a> nobody there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2834.949s">So</a> whatever they thought they were going to accomplish, they're not accomplishing. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2838.23s">And</a> changing from 7 to 7 to 8 to 6, it's 12 hours a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2842.032s">That's</a> 48 hours a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2844.213s">Think</a> about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2844.833s">I</a> mean, if I was Republican, I'd be running out of town and saying, hey, this isn't worth it for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2849.315s">And</a> that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2851.416s">So</a> that's my comment as an aside to what you folks talked about right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2856.219s">And</a> it's obvious. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2857.439s">Again,</a> the problems continue to exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2859.891s">with</a> the McGlynn Traffic Enforcement Program, it's just not working. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2863.892s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2864.892s">Councilor</a> Knight.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3216.659s">Quick.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3218.38s">You</a> just alluded to the word consensus, and I just want to highlight the fact that I thank you for bringing that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3224.364s">I</a> think the Mayor of Boston should be complimented. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3226.793s">for</a> him asking the citizens of Boston and anyone what their thoughts might be for the expansion or the upgrading of the City Hall Plaza down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3236.081s">And</a> that's just a great way to get people involved when you do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3240.224s">What</a> a shame that that doesn't take place in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3243.147s">And</a> this administration is so close-knit on everything that they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3246.329s">There's</a> been nothing that talks about, nothing that talks about complete community interaction. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3251.433s">So</a> I thank you for bringing that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3252.855s">And</a> I would hope, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3255.067s">Wouldn't</a> that be interesting if we put a budget item, a line item in the budget for community expansion by way of advertising. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3262.493s">So</a> when something comes up of a great magnitude, the people of this community, everyone will be notified in advance and they'll have a chance to participate rather than the clothes shop that apparently operates right now in a vacuum. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3275.144s">It's</a> a vacuum. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3276.105s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3276.446s">Councilor.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3598.075s">Quick</a> question. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3604.689s">Yes,</a> sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3605.649s">You</a> used the term, if we could do it and put it on Maiden Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3609.151s">What</a> is Maiden Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3610.271s">What</a> is that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3967.351s">Well,</a> I would like to discuss the minutes of 224 if they're relative to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3971.854s">If</a> they're relative to something else, that's a different story.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_vNUWiKdVZmw/2025-03-21_vNUWiKdVZmw.html">Medford City Council - March 3, 2015</a></h2>

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1086.081s">The</a> question I would have, where are they going to park their cars? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1088.702s">Where</a> are they going to park their cars? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1090.323s">Are</a> they going to infringe upon the neighborhood?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1134.976s">And</a> is this a reintroduction of the old Italian club that used to be on Up and South? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1138.438s">Pardon</a> me? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1138.918s">Is</a> this a reintroduction of the Italian club that used to be up on South Method? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1143.401s">No,</a> not at all.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1208.165s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1208.585s">If</a> that is all Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1209.985s">And</a> one last thing, John, uh, on your page that you have coming back from the department of revenue and the letter of compliance, I'm sorry, on the letter that came back from the department of revenue that was submitted, the indicate you have no withholding, no sales and no room occupancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1225.789s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1233.691s">But</a> in that pipe that you filed, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1235.658s">you're</a> not being responsible for withholding sales in room and room.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1240.301s">But</a> what are you going to do if, in fact, in the future you said you folks are going to be applying possibly for a liquor license? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1246.405s">Now,</a> somebody has to pay for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1248.706s">So</a> are the members going to pay for that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1267.09s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1267.931s">If</a> you were to get a liquor license from the City and your members go there for an event, are they going to charge for the alcohol that they are going to be serving? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1276.097s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1276.618s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1277.058s">Then</a> you would have to come back and reapply for a sales tax provision as far as that part goes.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3860.618s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3863.279s">This</a> is one of the very few times that I guess I'm lost for words because it's maybe Councilor Camuso, maybe you hit it right in the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3870.503s">The</a> fact of the matter is, I look at this as the evil empire of a disease that apparently has come into our community and it's been neglected. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3880.988s">And</a> it's roared its ugly head to such a point that this demon of a disease now <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3888.307s">has</a> brought folks who are dealing with this on a daily basis to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3895.292s">And</a> I think we all are. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3896.953s">I'll</a> speak for myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3899.714s">In</a> the family, yes, there is. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3901.356s">So</a> I'll just leave it at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3903.137s">I</a> have an understanding as to what's being said. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3906.479s">But</a> my opinion would be this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3909.361s">I</a> think the city needs to make a full-fledged financial, educational, and social, and a budgetary commitment <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3916.587s">that</a> if we're really going to be serious, we're going to take this right down to the lowest level of education, starting with the kids who are in nursery school, not nursery, what's the next level? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3925.956s">First</a> grade, and all the way up, and let them understand the danger of what this disease is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3932.883s">You</a> know, Councilor Caraviello talked about his friend, 61 years old, Councilor Camuso, his age just a little bit younger. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3939.317s">There's</a> other folks even younger, and there are adults, mothers and fathers who sometimes become addicted. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3945.323s">For</a> why it happens, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3948.506s">But</a> if this city has the good fortune to go out of its way to raise over a million dollars for a brand new peace garden, they can go out of its way to find the necessary tools to have a budget appropriation that's going to deal with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3964.76s">as</a> part of the medical justification why the city of Medford does care about its inhabitants, its students, its families, its mothers, its fathers, and anyone who might have an addiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3976.83s">I</a> think tonight is a big wake-up call for this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3980.052s">For</a> the folks that came up there and spoke, was it hard to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3983.495s">It</a> certainly was hard, but I think you're really relieved that you came up here and said it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3988.075s">because</a> you've now got the entire council, I'll leave Councilor De La Ruza to himself, you've got at least six councilors speaking right now, and I think we're all in your court. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3997.923s">New</a> Governor Baker, his second commitment was the opiate problem here in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4004.348s">So</a> right from the governor's office all the way down, there is going to be nexus as to how this city and where this city should be going. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4011.493s">I</a> not only concur with you, Councilor Marks, I just think it's, you know, it's been laid under the rug for so long <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4018.503s">And</a> how do you say it other than the fact, you know, enough is enough? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4024.086s">The</a> police department, I'm quite sure, can come up here and tell you case after case, story after story, arrest after arrest. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4030.509s">It</a> does have an impact in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4032.891s">And</a> why should anybody be afraid to say that particular house or that particular part of the city, you know, there's drugs over there more than another part. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4039.514s">There</a> should be no drugs at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4041.627s">There</a> should be no drugs at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4042.968s">And</a> to get to no drugs at all, friends like Janelle, if you know someone that's on it, you've got to just turn them in and that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4050.054s">It's</a> the only way you're going to save their life because no one else is either going to do it or they want to get involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4056.178s">You</a> know, we're seven adults here behind this rail. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4059.921s">And</a> I'm quite sure they will all agree on this one here. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4062.383s">Do</a> we want to see this continue on? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4063.804s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4064.004s">Do</a> we want to see it corrected? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4065.245s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4066.326s">And</a> the first step is, as Councilman Marks has his resolution going forward, but I honestly think it should be <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4071.791s">stepped</a> up even further. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4073.272s">I</a> think a dollar amount should be put into the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4075.393s">I</a> think there should be a social, educational, and a financial commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4082.616s">And</a> you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4083.216s">The</a> newspaper is here right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4085.437s">And</a> I'd like to have the newspaper report and make this its headline story as it relates to the Medford City Council recognizes the drug problem in the city of Medford, and they're going to demand from the city administration that action takes place <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4097.273s">to</a> protect those that are either in the program or having drugs, and to protect the families that have children, unfortunately, who are addicted to this, because they need help just as much as the person that's addicted in the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4110.581s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I would hope that you, as leader of our council, conclude by offering not only your support to Councilor Marks' resolution, but let's have the folks walk out of this audience here tonight and recognize they came here <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4123.862s">with</a> a true and honest and a just purpose, and they did get results tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4128.325s">They</a> didn't get lip service, they didn't get a press conference, and I thank you for Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4132.408s">You</a> did bring that up a few weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4134.25s">The</a> mayor tried a jump shot, but he didn't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4136.572s">You</a> beat him to the punch because you were legitimate. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4138.673s">The</a> issue was legitimate, and that's where it belongs. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4141.215s">It</a> has a smack of legitimacy that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4144.438s">It's</a> not a phony, come on. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4145.959s">It's</a> a true reality in life here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4148.721s">And</a> if drugs are out there, then the first thing to do is you have to recognize it, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4153.265s">Address</a> it and work to get rid of it slowly. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4156.047s">And</a> the only way you're going to do that is you're going to have to bring it to the attention of every single person, and starting with just your children at the youngest of age, to let them know that this is not good for their health, their mind, their body, and their spirit. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4167.855s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4832.501s">A</a> question. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4832.861s">I</a> want to go back to Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4834.702s">You</a> talked about the D.A. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4835.603s">program.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4835.823s">Where</a> did you want the D.A. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4836.644s">program</a> to go? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4837.564s">Every</a> school. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4838.905s">Starting</a> from kindergarten up?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5435.256s">I</a> believe also, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5442.16s">Over</a> and beyond the moving violation, there's another one in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5446.302s">Unpaid</a> parking tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5448.764s">What</a> about them?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5477.581s">Sir,</a> you made your application out on December 4th of 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5481.203s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5481.463s">And</a> the question was asked, do you owe money for any parking fines? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5486.186s">And</a> the answer is yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5488.227s">And</a> do you owe money for parking tickets? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5489.788s">And</a> the answer is yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5491.91s">I</a> don't owe. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5494.391s">No,</a> but he's trying to, this was in December. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5497.573s">You</a> haven't paid since December. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5499.574s">This</a> is now March. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5502.87s">And</a> what is the traffic violation for?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5541.805s">Did</a> you pay that fine?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5556.399s">Which</a> city was that, sir?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5561.761s">So</a> you made your appeal to the city of Boston? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5563.502s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5564.002s">Did</a> you have your hearing? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5565.563s">Please?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5566.023s">Did</a> you have your hearing? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5567.224s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5569.245s">Next</a> week?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5570.745s">Next</a> week.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5576.828s">And</a> what about the parking tickets? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5577.929s">What</a> about those? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5579.329s">How</a> many parking tickets do you have? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5586.251s">I</a> think I have two. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5587.892s">Mr.</a> Chairman, before the license is granted, tickets, and if he's going next week for the hearing, can we hold that off until we get the results?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5833.247s">The</a> Corey check is basically for criminal background check. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5835.507s">It's</a> not for licenses and it's not for a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5838.468s">So</a> what the chief is saying is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5840.828s">And</a> I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5841.628s">as</a> a city clerk has questioned seven and eight strike that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5846.509s">Well,</a> six really wouldn't come up under the query, but seven and eight definitely would not come up under the query. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5852.11s">And</a> I think those need to be, uh, as council max alluded to, I think they need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5856.21s">And</a> I agree with council Caraviello, um, to hold us in the dance until both of these are resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5861.631s">But</a> don't forget this application was made getting everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5865.672s">The</a> chief responded on February 19th and this fellow made his application on January 16th. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5873.448s">This</a> is what I don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5875.449s">He</a> filed on January 16th, 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5878.149s">The</a> last fellow that was up here put his application on December 4th, 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5884.831s">Why</a> is there such a spread in time before these things get approved?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5894.533s">No,</a> December 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5895.833s">December</a> 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5897.154s">The</a> last gentleman applied December 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5899.914s">This</a> gentleman applied January 16th.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5958.799s">I</a> understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5959.439s">But</a> I don't understand the, both of them came back at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5962.65s">to</a> be presented before the council, and there's almost a month and a half spread between both applicants.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6037.567s">A</a> vote of five in the affirmative, two in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6039.828s">Let</a> the record reflect the reason why I, and I believe my council colleague, voted no was because of the impending review of the traffic law, I mean the tax.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6248.477s">When</a> was that supposed to become effective? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6251.418s">Because</a> that's the calls I'm getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6253.339s">When</a> does the 8 to 6 become effective?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6488.802s">Councilor</a> Penta real quick on the convenience fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6490.723s">I</a> think it was, um, uh, mighty Walsh, the mayor of Boston who was trying to, um, and I believe they have the same system that we have there. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6498.149s">They're</a> negotiating for 12 and a half cents. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6499.811s">I</a> believe rather than 35 cents that's presently out there, but that's neither here or there. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6504.767s">I</a> believe we're dating back to January 16th of this past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6507.988s">One</a> of the members on the commission, um, Mrs. DeLorenzo, I, you know, I think it was subsequent to the council's request to change this to eight to six. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6517.39s">And</a> that was sent to, um, uh, council, you know, Mr. Rumbly on February 3rd, a solicitor did render an opinion and he did run her opinion basically saying that it falls within the purview of the traffic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6529.192s">But</a> he makes a very interesting note on the second page of his, of his opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6533.663s">He</a> states, as to the effect of the regulatory rate changes on the contract, quote, substantial change, that impedes or enhances enforcement may result in a negative or positive impact on percentage payments that may be due under the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6550.294s">The</a> same is true for substantial reduction or increase on parking spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6555.157s">So,</a> and I believe, again, the argument that was brought up, or our issue was brought up in discussion, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6562.688s">And</a> that from 7 to 7, you're going from 8 to 6. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6565.79s">That's</a> a substantial change in the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6567.771s">And</a> I believe it was you, Councilor Caraviello, I believe, who asked for the review after the first 60 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6574.934s">And</a> within that 60 days, we're going to have an idea just where they're going, what revenues or lack thereof with the change of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6582.058s">And</a> if they consider this to be a substantial change in the contract, this is going to have to be reviewed a step further. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6588.161s">I'd</a> like to just bring one other attention to this whole issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6591.462s">During</a> this past week, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6594.419s">I</a> received the following points of concern from residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6598.902s">There</a> is a lady who walked in Medford square in the CVS and she went to go put the money in the meter and she fell down and she had to be rushed to the Lawrence Memorial Hospital because of, because of just trying to get to the meter where the snow bank was. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6613.493s">Also</a> in an area that we were told that Republic was going to be apprised as to what's going on, I believe during the past two weeks, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6622.777s">There</a> was a funeral that took place at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6624.978s">Joseph's</a> Church on High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6627.519s">And</a> when the folks came out that went to the funeral mass, their cars were all ticketed and tagged. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6633.281s">And</a> apparently the good father over there had to go down to the police department or Republic to get that resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6640.923s">The</a> subsequent concern that came out of that, because they do operate on a Saturday, the priest's concern was, what if there's a wedding? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6649.747s">Are</a> those people going to be tagged? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6651.366s">that</a> go to church on Saturday on a wedding. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6653.807s">And</a> I believe we were told by the Republic that once they knew what was going on, none of these people would be tagged. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6659.851s">And</a> here it is, they just got tagged two weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6662.633s">And</a> then during this past Sunday, in the bulletin of the church, there is a notation as it relates to the collaboration of the churches between St. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6672.959s">Joseph's</a> and St. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6673.699s">Francis.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6674.82s">And</a> because of the collaboration, they're going to use alternate dates, especially for the Feast <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6681.17s">Easter,</a> but he indicates over here, we plan and underscore that the fact that we are now in a collaborative, but we also need to work around each parish's schedule and as well as the parking meter times that have become an issue of late. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6696.657s">Now,</a> we were told that this was not going to be a problem for the churches and for them to put it into the bulletin, having not only a problem already exist, it's obvious that Republic just has not gotten the message. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6709.724s">Once</a> again, last week I introduced pictures of Republic driving down the street, not having properly marked notices on their car, supposed to be in the back. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6719.03s">All</a> they had was, all they have now was just a P on the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6722.132s">There's</a> no telephone number, there's no identification of who they are or what they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6725.815s">So</a> I really think there are some serious infractions in this particular contract that they have here with the city of Medford.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6744.703s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6745.644s">I</a> have not seen anything there yet either. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6747.445s">So</a> why? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6748.606s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6749.226s">But</a> the fact of the matter is now, I think it's now been bumped up and escalated. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6753.229s">If</a> you have one of the churches in our community expressing not only a problem, not only a problem with a funeral, potential problem for a wedding, and now putting it in the bulletin that addresses a community of over 9,700 people, which make up the parish of St. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6768.258s">Joe's,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6769.705s">and</a> relative to the meat is becoming an issue, the lady falling down in Medford Square having to be taken by an ambulance. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6776.047s">I</a> just really think that this program really is not business friendly, it's not friendly to the community, and hopefully Councilor Caraviello, when the 60 days are up, we will have numbers to work on, and as far as I'm concerned, I would make a determination that we opt out of this whole program. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6795.374s">It'll</a> be the best money the city ever paid, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6797.628s">and</a> bring a city back to some sense of normalcy. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6800.709s">Thank</a> you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6801.509s">Councilor</a> Caraviello.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6920.218s">I</a> would like to have my resolution on there also to, I mean, my amendment to that as it relates to the churches. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6925.219s">So</a> whether it's for a funeral and now for a wedding during the hours that they said that they weren't going to, uh, you know, and it's, it's obvious, you know, for them to put it in the bulletin, it's, it's presented itself as a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6936.562s">Also,</a> Mr. President, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6938.264s">We</a> were also told that at the parking commission, maybe three, four weeks ago, that all the city's parking lots would be three hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6949.23s">Nothing</a> has been changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6950.691s">No</a> signage has been changed to three hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6954.013s">And</a> you still have signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6955.474s">You</a> can go down Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6956.594s">Signs</a> are bolted to the trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6958.075s">It's</a> ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6962.338s">This</a> company is just not doing what it's supposed to be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6965.239s">It's</a> quite obvious that the mayor doesn't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6967.148s">He</a> just signs a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6968.129s">He</a> really doesn't care what the impact is, and it's obvious. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6970.771s">But</a> I just really think that there is something wrong with how this whole operation is basically taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6977.355s">I</a> had a lady turn around and tell me, I believe on Governor's Avenue, they changed, by Carlene's over there, they changed the two hours to a 30-minute parking spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6985.481s">The</a> Traffic Commission approved it in their minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6988.498s">A</a> lady went out there, and the guy was coming around the street and was going to give her a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6992.019s">I</a> said, what are you doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6992.779s">She's</a> only been in. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6993.46s">She's</a> only inside for 10 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6995.78s">No,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6996.64s">Don't</a> tell me. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6997.221s">I</a> mean, I'm watching. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6998.141s">I'm</a> right there with her. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7000.182s">So</a> how do they make this arbitrary decision of who's going to be there if there's no way to determine it?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7114.739s">If</a> we could, Councilor Pater. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7116.339s">On</a> the same thing, what Councilor Camuso just alluded to, whether it's 15 minutes or 30 minutes, you have spots in the city that's an hour or two hours, and there's no kiosks or anything there. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7123.901s">So</a> how do they make these judgmental calls by going down there and, you know, they're going to take the time and write every number down? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7130.102s">You</a> know, I saw something interesting the other... It's all in the sky. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7133.043s">Yeah,</a> I saw something interesting the other day. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7135.567s">I</a> was on Boston Avenue in the morning, and we saw the car going down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7141.249s">He</a> was going down, how can you say, going towards Somerville on Boston Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7147.151s">He</a> was probably going down there to check out the people, and all of a sudden, he must have got a call, and he whipped his rear around, and he blew through that intersection at least 40, Councilman Marks was there, 40 to 50 miles an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7158.135s">He</a> gave no credit, because going right back to what you said, they probably got a buzzer that went off, that the person in the two hours was already over and beyond, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7166.397s">This</a> makes no sense how they run this operation that there was no consistency and you know How do you give out a ticket to someone when it's not even? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7173.863s">When</a> it's a snow emergency these people should know what's going on They should read the newspaper or they should be tied into the weather report that talks about a snow emergency in the city It's just unfair On the motion of Councilor Marks as amended all those in favor.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7598.394s">Mr.</a> President, I have a whole folder here on this whole idea of this MS-4. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7603.156s">This</a> has been around for maybe the last couple of years or thereabouts, maybe 2011 when it first came up. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7610.199s">This</a> mandate would put an absolute tremendous cost upon the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7616.002s">And</a> as a result of that, especially as the whole resolution recites itself, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7622.134s">They're</a> giving no help, no assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7624.375s">You're</a> on your own. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7625.856s">Whether</a> the city of Medford, again, whether they want to join a coalition or not, it would be up to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7631.2s">But</a> I just think an $800,000, $900,000 hit on an annual basis for every one of the cities and towns to have to be looking at this right now, especially when we have unfunded retirement benefits that need to be paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7644.969s">Just</a> as tonight, just looking at the problem with the drugs and that's impact here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7651.412s">But</a> this is something I really think that the city of Medford needs to do, as other cities and towns are beginning to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7658.457s">Send</a> letters to the EPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7661.519s">And</a> they have an address in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7664.721s">It's</a> 5 Boston Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7666.923s">But</a> I also think that our federal state representatives, Catherine Clark, and Markey, and Warren, need to be on board with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7676.329s">They're</a> the first ones out there saying, oh, we've got to help the people and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7680.825s">You</a> can't help the people by giving unfunded mandates such as this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7683.627s">Absolutely,</a> totally unfunded. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7685.848s">And</a> they have taken grants away that normally could have been used or would have been used for things such as this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7691.231s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I have no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7694.653s">It</a> probably would be even more helpful if our city engineer was on board with this or our Department of Public Works. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7701.717s">But</a> I think at the outset, as a legislative body, as these other 85 cities and towns are doing, they're sending in these letters. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7708.461s">And</a> basically, you're just asking them <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7710.242s">to</a> delay it until you're ready to put a practical program in place that cities and towns can take a look at and can see. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7717.588s">The</a> way this thing is set up right now, if you have a street sweeper that goes down the street, you can't even have that street sweeper anywhere near a gutter because of what it's going to be able to go in there, because that's part of the stormwater drain. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7729.437s">So</a> there's a whole host of things that are implied with this, like I said. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7734.901s">This</a> has been going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7736.282s">I</a> have all this stuff here. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7737.868s">Uh,</a> but this is really, that's the issue of the resolution is, is the gut of the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7742.269s">And,</a> um, the point person, uh, well, the point person for the city would be the city engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7747.63s">Cause</a> they're, and, and, uh, Paul gear, who happens to be the director of public works, but it's, it's an issue that the city just cannot handle. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7755.611s">They</a> don't have the personnel and they don't have the expertise. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7758.812s">Um,</a> they may be expertise enough to understand what needs to be done, but we don't have the tools to implement this thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7764.833s">And</a> we don't have any resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7766.395s">that</a> the federal government are now imposing upon cities and towns, where the federal government should be having these workshops, should be having cities and towns go there to understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7776.158s">And</a> when you get your notice of intent permit, have it in more of a reasonable way, not 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7781.34s">And</a> then you have to have the whole program complete within a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7783.721s">It's</a> a cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7785.097s">It's</a> huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7785.618s">It's</a> 900,000 or thereabouts.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7793.463s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7794.244s">So</a> I have no problem to take the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7798.547s">We</a> can work with it, add or subtract to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7800.708s">But</a> the EPA is in Boston at 5 Post Office Square in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7805.391s">And</a> I believe that they are and they will accept comments as it relates to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7812.236s">And</a> I believe the more comments they get, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7814.138s">They'll</a> have an understanding that we can't go forward with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7816.759s">But</a> I think it's also beneficial, again, that our federal delegation becomes on board with this, too, because they can say, well, it needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7826.122s">A</a> lot of things need to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7827.922s">But</a> we've had so many unfunded mandates. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7829.923s">Leave</a> No Child Behind is one, which is an educational mandate. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7833.364s">But</a> this is something that's really huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7835.264s">And</a> this isn't just a one-shot deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7836.865s">This</a> is every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7837.725s">You're</a> going to have to deal with this thing every single year. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7839.686s">And</a> you're going to have to buy the equipment and the tools and everything that goes with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7844.31s">I'd</a> like to, um, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7846.592s">What</a> do you want to do with it? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7847.632s">I,</a> I would just like to send the letter off to the EPA and then just refer it upstairs and hopefully that the city administration does what they're supposed to do.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7861.182s">You</a> could do that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7870.057s">So</a> if we could, uh, legislative bodies, administrative and legislative bodies, we have a mayor, other cities and towns have city managers, but they have been soliciting, um, commentaries from legislative bodies, which is councils as well as the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7885.327s">So</a> it just adds to the impact of recognizing that there is a cost involved in getting to that cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7891.33s">There's</a> just no preparation. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7892.931s">It's</a> onto the cities and towns.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7935.167s">Mr.</a> President, the Watershed Association has nothing to do with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7939.49s">This</a> is an EPA mandate as it relates to our wastewater disposal and how it's going through, and whether it's through the – just how it's leaving the city, or all cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7953.357s">And</a> this is something where 85 cities and towns <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7955.77s">have</a> now, either through a coalition or independently, are asking the federal government to put a hold on this and waiting until appropriate federal funding is available to ensure that these requirements don't translate into a financial burden. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7968.779s">There's</a> no workshops being held up on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7972.102s">I'm</a> quite sure that our city engineer is aware of this, but like I said, this is now coming through after meeting and having this discussion and reviewing what <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7985.023s">85</a> cities and towns are now doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7986.304s">So</a> it's just, you know, we're not going to be novel on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7989.845s">This</a> is a direct approach of an unfunded mandate from the federal government.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8003.889s">So</a> on that motion and or the city council can take its own independent action after whatever she does.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8056.823s">Counsel</a> Penton? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8057.823s">In</a> June of 2014, Mr. Sano had his name placed in nomination for Retailer of the Year after he received the award of the Greater Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8066.844s">And</a> the competition to become the Realtor of the Year <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8070.452s">put</a> him into 15 real estate associations, and in competition with 20,000 individuals whose name came up for review for the particular purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8081.755s">If</a> anybody does know Mr. Sano, he works at Remax in Medford Square, Remax Andrew Realty. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8087.976s">He's</a> completely dedicated not only to his job, to his family, but the whole idea of being a professional in this particular job. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8097.098s">And</a> I believe anyone that knows him, especially in that office, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8100.8s">They</a> will tell you on a daily basis he lives, sleeps, and eats, being a good real estate person for whoever his client might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8112.086s">Also,</a> he's also well known in the regional area of realtors and the greater Boston leadership because of commitment to doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8121.51s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to have Mr. Sano come before the council, receive the award, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8128.131s">for</a> which was given out, I believe, this past December by the vice president of, I guess, the State of the Professional Awards reception this past December. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8139.136s">And</a> it would be nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8139.956s">You</a> know, we seem to be blessed having certain business folks in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8145.378s">You</a> know, most recently we just had Dr. Lepore receive a piece of legislation that was passed long overdue as it relates to <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8153.588s">wind</a> instruments and helping to protect people not to get any diseases from using it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8158.389s">We</a> have Victor Garrow, who made national acclaim by defending a person for 30 years and bringing justice to someone not being found guilty for a crime that he didn't commit. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8168.252s">And</a> here we have now a local realtor here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8171.413s">We</a> have three people from three different walks of life, and I just think folks like that need to be recognized. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8178.469s">and</a> let people know that in our city of Medford, there are many citizens of the year, and they come from many walks of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8185.554s">So</a> that being said, I'd like to have Mr. Clark, we can get in touch with Mr. Sano and have him come to a future council meeting.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8417.815s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8419.616s">In</a> that packet, we received a letter from the mayor <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8422.39s">uh,</a> dated February 27th, as it relates to the, uh, um, the GIC situation that we discussed last week in the letter, um, they may have make some mistake on the right in the beginning, uh, plan design rest for GIC. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8435.998s">There</a> will be a voting on the rates on their upcoming March 3rd meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8439.861s">It</a> isn't March 3rd, it's tomorrow, March 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8442.743s">And</a> for those who might be interested in this March 4th meeting, which is tomorrow, and I believe it's at eight 15 or between eight 15, eight 30, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8451.101s">You</a> can attend the meeting, but they're not going to allow public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8454.383s">So</a> that unfortunately seems to set another tempo here. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8458.524s">Also</a> in the letter, basically substantiates, I think, what we discussed last week, at least what I said. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8465.327s">The</a> unfortunate part of the GIC program, it's been intentionally underfunded for the past three years, and they never took it into any consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8473.65s">And</a> when they were doing their budgetary process, the prior administration, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8478.523s">They</a> never took into consideration the additional people who were joining GIC and that the end of federal funds were not being forthcoming to the Commonwealth of Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8491.688s">So</a> the cost of approximately $162 to $197 million is the cost right now, unfortunately, that GIC is going to be held accountable for to make whole this whole idea of those cities and towns that are in the GIC program. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8507.473s">Another</a> thing, another major change that they have made, it's going to go from an annual January to December to a fiscal year, which will be July 1st to June 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8516.88s">And</a> one of the keys in here is as follows, and I think it just segues itself into what we talked about last week, which is the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8526.466s">It</a> states, the GIC members can only change from an individual to a family or a family to an individual coverage with the qualifying event, which is marriage, birth, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8536.647s">adoption</a> of a child, change in the dependent eligibility, divorce, pursuant to subject matter chapter 32A, eligibility requirement, death of a spouse, dependent or a spouse, or dependence and voluntary loss of coverage elsewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8551.974s">Now,</a> by having that, that one-time event, and coupling that with Harvard Health and Tufts going from a PPO to a POS, the next part that seems to be an unqualified issue <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8565.605s">is</a> the fact that anyone who's in PPO and goes to a POS, whether it be in Tufts or Harvard, if you have a particular doctor in a particular hospital that are not in it, you cannot go to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8577.69s">You</a> lose that doctor. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8578.931s">You</a> lose that hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8580.731s">So</a> what was said before is, while the 85-15 might stay the same, there is a huge, there will be a 6% to 12% increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8591.376s">That's</a> what it looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8592.696s">The</a> projection is going to be <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8594.527s">at</a> tomorrow's event for them to take the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8598.769s">This</a> administration, the Baker administration, I believe, is committed to offsetting by a supplemental budget, getting close to that $192 million, which appears to be the magic number right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8611.556s">But</a> also, with that being said, the issue of whether, in fact, monies are going to be forthcoming in the future as it relates to offsetting that, that's going to be another issue unto itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8624.613s">I</a> think what needs to take place, and if I understand the gentleman who came here last week and indicated we're locked in until 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8632.474s">Now,</a> the only thing that we're locked into is the percentage rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8636.035s">We're</a> not locked into keeping the rates what they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8639.736s">The</a> city of Medford, as well as each subscriber, is going to have to wind up paying for this in some shape, manner, or form. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8646.697s">So</a> if you're a current employee, you're a retiree, a survivor, a school teacher, a policeman, a fireman, a municipal employee, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8654.743s">are</a> going to pay for this effective July 1st with the rates that will be forthcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8660.665s">One</a> of the things that were brought up in discussion, and it was a point made really applicable by the Mass Teachers Association and the American Teachers Association, and their claim is quite candid, that they honestly feel that this whole health care cost, which is an outrageous cost, is being driven by insurance companies because <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8682.295s">The</a> driving of these rates are going up because of the claims. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8686.856s">And</a> the claims are being predicated by people going to more expensive either hospitals or more expensive doctors. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8692.537s">Now,</a> when the program and the problem was being introduced, strike that, when the whole insurance issue was being introduced, I believe in 2011, for which the city of Medford jumped on board, effective July, January 1st of 2012, the whole idea was to reduce our insurance cost here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8710.761s">Let's</a> just talk about the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8713.272s">And</a> that would have worked very well, and I think everybody recognized the fact that their co-pays and their family costs were going to go up as part of joining this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8721.235s">But</a> the city of Medford indicated that they would be saving approximately $25 to $26 million over a four-and-a-half, five-year period of time.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8731.24s">No,</a> this is the presentation of today, attending the meeting that the governor was at, and we had this discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8738.202s">You</a> don't mind, do you? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8738.923s">It's</a> information that is forthcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8740.764s">And</a> as a result of that, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8742.175s">This</a> information is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8743.717s">So</a> anyone who was on GIC here in the city of Medford, Unicare, that seems to be the difference between Tufts Health and what's the other one? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8754.812s">I</a> just forgot it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8758.776s">And</a> what is the other one? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8760.637s">I</a> just forgot the other name. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8762.338s">Well,</a> anyway, Harvard Health, Tufts Health and Harvard Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8764.94s">So</a> the tradeoff is going to be your fees and costs are going to be higher in Tufts Health and Harvard Health, but Unicare may be at an issue where they might either be the same or they may go down. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8777.41s">But</a> the real major concern is anyone who has their PPO is going to go to a POS, you are going to lose <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8784.777s">If</a> you lose your doctor or the hospital associated with it that you had before, and the PPO, and it's not found in the POS, then you cannot go to that doctor. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8793.138s">You're</a> going to have to find another doctor in another hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8795.539s">So</a> these are one of the diminishing things that are taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8798.459s">And</a> now we're up to 60 communities, 60 communities that seem to be ready to jump on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8803.94s">We</a> were at 50 at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8805.08s">Now</a> we're up to 60 cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8807.141s">And</a> again, the argument is the larger the numbers, the lower the cost should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8810.741s">But</a> it's not working out that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8812.442s">And</a> one of the big stumbling blocks <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8814.299s">The</a> Patrick administration, for three years in a row, underfunded intentionally the liability that was necessary to be paid in that GIC program. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8823.843s">And</a> that's where we're at right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8825.704s">So</a> what started off as a $320 million deficit, when the Patrick administration said they were passing a budget that's current and it's level, it's now up to, I think, almost $900 million, a shade under a billion dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8839.93s">And</a> these are one of the areas, unfortunately, that are being taxed. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8844.058s">Hopefully,</a> the mayor who was the negotiator in behalf of this can recognize the wherewithal to do something that offsets before 2017 no further increases that we would have to pay here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8858.226s">I</a> don't know what the relationship is between Harvard and Pilgrim with employees, retirees, and survivors as compared to Unicare, but that does and that will have an effect upon the city of Medford.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=484.87s">Another</a> question. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=485.651s">Um,</a> um, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=490.351s">I'm</a> trying to get the visualization. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=491.611s">Is</a> this on the side of the street where Colleen's is on? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=494.452s">Is</a> that the hole? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=495.292s">The</a> hole that was there?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=496.772s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=497.472s">If</a> I remember correctly, too, on that particular hole that continuously started to sink, it was getting larger and larger. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=503.134s">And</a> the unfortunate part about it, I know some business merchants had called up until it almost actually caved in. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=509.255s">And</a> that's the place some months earlier, many months earlier, I believe the MWRA was there as they were addressing a water leak on that particular part of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=519.568s">I</a> believe, on a connection, and it was filled in. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=522.19s">And</a> I think on this one here, I think, if I remember correctly, it's where the sinkhole is going next to the curb, but it was right by the curb, and it just kept sinking, and it kept going in and in and in. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=535.379s">So</a> maybe the better issue is you can get back to us when it was done, but just how fragile is that particular? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=545.466s">A</a> lot of work has been done in that area over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=547.999s">And</a> maybe if we can get just an update from DPW, if we can add to the resolution.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=554.464s">Yeah,</a> to check that into the fragility. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=556.806s">Is</a> that such a word? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=557.586s">Yeah,</a> I think it's fragility.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=560.188s">The</a> fragility of the ground and the land in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=563.631s">Thank</a> you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=564.391s">Councilor</a> Long-Beaucourt.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=627.734s">I</a> like to, um, can we just move the consideration of the paper we laid in the table? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=633.019s">I</a> just like to bring that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=633.819s">I</a> want to do something different with it on the paper.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=652.64s">Mr.</a> President, I'm going to, I'd like to move that the paper be withdrawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=656.06s">And</a> what I'll do is I'll just introduce it next week as a separate resolution on the motion that this paper be withdrawn by a Councilor Penta.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=704.853s">Mr.</a> President, we all know that when this new implementation took place, going to a tiered rate system, there was some pushback as it relates to the tier 1, 2, and 3 setup that originally started off at 0 to 800 <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=722.149s">cubic</a> feet, 801 cubic feet to 1,600 cubic feet, and then from 1,600 cubic feet and up. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=728.273s">And</a> there was a lot of concern that was, I believe, expressed here at the council meeting, and also, likewise expressed, I think, to the Water and Sewer Rate Commissioners. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=737.579s">But</a> through their staff, led by Ron Baker, who was in charge, and he is, I believe, he's the operations supervisor over this, the request was made not only by the council, but to the commission that maybe we should just look at <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=751.535s">on</a> a percentage basis, just where are we going on this tiered rate system because, in essence, it did turn out to be a water rate increase for certain members. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=763.165s">Most</a> recently, at the last Water and Sewer Commission, there was an adjustment that did take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=769.971s">I</a> had made the suggestion that we should look at the first billing that goes out and just see how many people fall within that 0 to 800. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=777.499s">Because</a> at that point in time when they did it, it was an estimation of the same thing with tier 2 and the same thing with tier 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=784.481s">They've</a> now gone into a revised tier system, which now puts you into the tier 1 system up to the first 1,000 cubic feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=794.644s">And</a> tier 2 goes from 1,000 to 2,000, and tier 3 goes from 2,000 and up, which is a significant, not large, but it's a significant increase <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=807.623s">as</a> it relates to giving homeowners an opportunity to receive a benefit as it relates to the increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=815.266s">So</a> if I understand that chart correctly here, the billing cycle as it will go onto this new rate system will be as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=829.191s">I</a> believe you're getting to an approximate amount <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=836.405s">76%</a> from 66 to 76% of the single-family homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=842.109s">Condos</a> will go from 82 to 90%. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=843.61s">And</a> these are keeping the people in the 0 to 1,000 mark. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=848.433s">The</a> two-family will go from 76 to 85. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=850.254s">The</a> three-families will go from 79% to 87. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=854.257s">And</a> the four-family will go from 68. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=856.659s">And</a> that basically stayed the same at 68%. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=861.382s">Taking</a> all this into consideration, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=863.897s">What</a> it represents financially to the city is the following amount total. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=869.139s">It's</a> a savings of $69,230 and overall condos overall in the city will save approximately $39,363. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=874.081s">Single</a> families will come up to $21,881. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=876.281s">Two</a> families will come up to $6,888. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=877.322s">And</a> the three families, there's a saving of $1,096 total overall. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=893.13s">With</a> that being said, the opportunity is now increased for more savings. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=898.353s">I</a> believe, if I understand all of this correctly, that once you get to that zero to 1,000 mark, you go to 1,001, you'll only be charged a difference between 1,000 and 1,001 if you fall into that second tier system. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=912.942s">And</a> it would be the same argument going forward for the one to the two and the two and the two and the top. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=918.986s">I</a> want to thank Mr. Baker in particular and his working crew <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=923.238s">the</a> board for recognizing the fact that we need a little bit more equity in this water and sewer rate structure, since in fact it's an $8.5 million surplus sitting over there, and since in fact the mayor has yet to present anything to us that talks about a water and sewer street construction or water and sewer improvements in this community, and as the law writes itself, it basically says it either has to go to that type of a component, a water and sewer street reconstruction or water and sewer reconstruction, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=953.223s">or</a> the money has to go back to the rate payers. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=955.623s">So</a> I would hope that this is probably somewhat of a first step at looking at where we're going with this excess money that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=962.485s">Also,</a> with the tiered system that the council on numerous occasions has spoken to about, and now we'll have an opportunity to see it by increasing from 800 to 1,000 and from 1,600 to 2,000, the max on both, that's 200 cubic feet in the water, it's 400 cubic feet <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=982.395s">Tier</a> 2, which is the commercial rate, and above that, it's everyone else that uses it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=986.258s">It's</a> a high volume group and density. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=988.78s">I</a> think it's a good start. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=989.841s">And</a> once we get those adjustments recalculated, we'll have a better idea as to where we're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=995.465s">But</a> as it stands right now, I believe this will take effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=999.908s">If</a> I understand this, it's the next billing cycle, not the one that we just had. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1003.69s">I</a> believe it's the next billing cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1005.812s">So</a> with that being said, I just thought <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1010.607s">They</a> should be noticed out, and taxpayers should be aware of it, and people who did it should be recognized.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1056.448s">I</a> believe that's a separate issue as it relates to how the Water and Sewer Commission has now gotten into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1062.89s">We</a> did not have a tiered rate system at that point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1065.171s">The</a> tiered rate system <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1066.233s">I</a> believe came in October, November of this past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1069.014s">As</a> a result of that, and because of the pushback and the concerns from rate payers and taxpayers, their initial tier one, two, and three systems had somewhat of a concern with people as to the charges. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1081.621s">So</a> listening to not only the council, council members and taxpayers, they bumped it up to zero to 1,000 instead of zero to 800. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1088.724s">And</a> the 1,000 now goes to one to 2,000 and 2,000 plus coming up to be the max. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1096.13s">There</a> are representative percentages as it relates to your water bill that's coming forward, how and what the mayor is going to do relative to the 600,000 that the council cut out. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1106.157s">We</a> still haven't seen that and have no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1108.459s">And</a> you know, as we know, each and every year for the last four years, there's been a million dollar surplus or thereabouts sitting in a, and that's how we get in our free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1117.225s">So,</a> so maybe that's how it's just going to Peter itself out at the end of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1120.067s">I</a> don't know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1163.856s">Let's</a> go.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1235.626s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1237.287s">You're</a> right about the increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1239.008s">I</a> believe it was a 10% or 11% increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1241.789s">That</a> represented the $600,000 in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1244.891s">And</a> I believe that the four members of the council who voted to eliminate that out of the budget was because of the fact that we had an $8.5 million surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1252.275s">And</a> because we had $8.5 million surplus, why should we be going out and taxing on that particular part? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1259.158s">This</a> here is something, apparently, that goes back, I believe, to April or May of 2014, when they first had a discussion on a rate system. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1270.465s">I</a> think it was Councilman Marks who originally brought up the issue on the more you use, the more you pay in commercial vendors. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1276.308s">And</a> I think this goes back to the former city engineer, who supposedly was in charge of whatever he was in charge of. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1284.133s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1285.858s">But</a> to get to this point here, it's a combination of not only conservation, but I think it's also a slow way of maybe addressing any increase that might be taking place in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1295.645s">But</a> this also has a component with the EPA, the federal EPA coming in here looking at a conservation method as it relates to water usage. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1304.211s">And</a> they have this broken down, what they think per person, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1307.353s">Of</a> course, the argument to that is if you have two or three or four kids in the family, that's all down the drain anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1312.236s">But</a> that's neither here nor there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1313.816s">So</a> this is a beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1315.057s">This</a> isn't a do all, be all. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1316.418s">It's</a> a beginning to not only do the conservation, but once again, we see what the numbers and other numbers come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1321.042s">And</a> if it works, it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1324.245s">If</a> it doesn't work, then we're going to have to look at it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1326.146s">But</a> it's better than going up with the rates and the cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1330.51s">It's</a> coming down to all four categories. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1333.592s">Single</a> family, condo, two family, and three family. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1336.375s">Four</a> families all stayed the same.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1403.879s">Thank</a> you, Honorable. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1404.92s">Continue</a> on that further? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1406.701s">I</a> was going to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1408.062s">That's</a> my last point. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1408.902s">So</a> you just brought it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1409.623s">So</a> I want to thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1410.964s">I</a> think, from what I understand from my involvement with Mass Municipal Association, cities and towns are now getting together just as it relates to that particular point. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1419.609s">So</a> maybe at the outset, and I don't know how to begin this, but maybe at the outset, maybe it should be City of Medford writes something to our state legislation or maybe to the MWRA and ask them <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1429.33s">for</a> them to set up some type of a system, maybe during certain months of the year, knowing where there's a lot of snowfall, that a lot of that water may go down the drain. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1435.952s">Because</a> they can tell you the increase, the amount of the increase of the water flow. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1440.713s">It's</a> obvious that some kind of a consideration is given or some kind of credit is given or whatever it might be, because it doesn't happen all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1448.595s">It's</a> only at this time of the year.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1873.975s">I'd</a> like to echo your comments, Councilor, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1876.416s">Monty</a> Hilson, well recognized within the boys baseball organizations, especially, you know, with the younger children. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1884.819s">And</a> I just think it's a fine recognition for long years of service.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1911.434s">Mr.</a> President, Lieutenant Goulding, Michael Goulding is a fine young man. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1916.216s">He's</a> had many wonderful years here in the Method Police Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1919.597s">And</a> I know our chief who's here right now tonight is sorry to see him go, but I think he's, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1924.53s">happy</a> to know he's been able to be elevated to a like comparison to him being a chief of another nice community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1932.094s">And</a> I just think it's nice to recognize one of our own achieving this type of a station in their life. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1939.919s">And</a> last night, the town of Western Board of Selectmen voted him in unanimously. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1944.281s">So</a> I just think it would be a proper, just to make a public recognition.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2367.467s">Um,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2368.447s">Uh,</a> I thank Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2370.107s">Uh,</a> we had a discussion on this earlier this week as it relates to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2373.268s">Uh,</a> I, I think it would be equally as important to have somebody here from, uh, Maura Haley's office as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2377.83s">This</a> was a 48 page decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2379.978s">And</a> I think it would be, you know, this council's been on top of this since day one. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2384.161s">We've</a> involved ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2386.162s">We've</a> had health partners, folks here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2388.543s">We</a> had Mr. Sachs here a couple of times, whether he agreed or disagreed, what his comments were. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2394.467s">At</a> least they were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2395.147s">There</a> was a public, two public forums. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2397.969s">But</a> the key is not because of the Lawrence Memorial Hospital or the Melrose Lakeville Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2403.752s">The</a> key to this whole story is the one down the South Shore. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2406.454s">And</a> that was the telling sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2409.812s">I</a> have some of the documents that she has issued, Maura Healy, but I think it would be important to have somebody here because I believe that there are other options available to the Lawrence Memorial Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2420.075s">It</a> may not be as great as what Partners was going to offer, but I think something like that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2426.677s">Also,</a> the fact that not only did Mr. Sack retire when we were told that he was going to continue on and be in charge of the Melrose-Wakefield, no matter what happened to this situation here, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2439.558s">So</a> I think there needs to be some information, Rick, on why he retired so suddenly, you know, and you would hope it's not a million dollar balloon payout because they didn't get their way. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2450.564s">I</a> mean, and who's going to be left holding the bag here is going to be all the patients and the doctors and the nurses that don't have an opportunity to go to that hospital or won't have an opportunity to go to that hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2460.108s">And</a> as we saw the amount of money that's being infused into the Melrose Wakefield Hospital, it's a pittance compared to what's taking place over here at the Lawrence Memorial. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2468.268s">So,</a> unfortunately, I think we're at the tail end of the stick on this one here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2471.709s">But</a> putting that aside, I think the other part of the story is I respectfully request that somebody from Maura Healey's office be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2480.753s">And</a> I think to have them all here at the same time to explain it would make a lot — would make sense.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2736.286s">Picking</a> up on what Councilor Camuso just alluded to, the fact of the matter is that I believe it was Mara Healy, her position was integrated with a host of other hospitals, presidents and executives from other hospitals, who said that this competition would be devastating to them <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2756.71s">It</a> would put partners in such a position that they would have some kind of a control that would take years and years and years to overcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2763.272s">Also,</a> there was no proven fact that the rates would go down as partners said that they would. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2769.374s">And</a> apparently, the documents that were submitted by these other executives from these other hospitals were enough to tantalize, let's put it this way, Maury Haley to the point of saying, hey, I'm not going to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2778.936s">But</a> also, she did indicate that if this went through, she was going to sue the judge because of the decision <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2784.865s">that</a> she made, and she felt as a result of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2787.827s">Now,</a> whether you agree or disagree with Maura Healy and why she's doing what she did, I don't think we can answer that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2794.83s">I</a> think we'll have a better understanding when all the parties are here and they can tell us what their reasoning is and what their reasoning isn't going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2802.214s">I</a> think Lawrence is the low man on the totem pole of all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2805.216s">There</a> was the South Shore Hospital first, then it's the Melrose-Wakefield, and they're going to be taken care of, and it's us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2810.018s">But</a> I believe that there is a game plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2811.579s">I</a> believe that there is a game plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2813.373s">may</a> not be as grandiose as they would have liked with partners coming on. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2818.397s">In</a> the 48-page decision that the judge wrote, she did say that there was a belief that the rising cost would be an estimated $50 million a year because of this merger. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2833.228s">And</a> because of this merger and the $50 million, and because of the opposition from other hospital executives and presidents, I believe that that probably weighed pretty heavily <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2843.72s">on</a> making the judge make the decision or to judge making her decision after knowing what Maura Healey was going to do, if, in fact, she did pass it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2853.287s">So.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3231.017s">Are</a> there any, maybe you should also refer this to the Office of Community Development to find out if there's any proposed <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3238.186s">that's</a> being scheduled for that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3240.148s">Councilor</a> Knight just alluded to something for which we all agreed upon on Locust Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3244.37s">And</a> you know, maybe it's always a sad situation, but maybe because of this building, it could stop the redevelopment of that particular area as it relates to, you know, where they're going, storefront signs, designs, sidewalks, and a whole host of other businesses that are down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3260.16s">So</a> I'd like to refer that to the OCD office as well to see if they might have a review on this particular subject matter.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3732.055s">Question.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3733.637s">Do</a> you want these for all in together or do you want to do them independently? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3736.719s">Because</a> each square is different to each other.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4148.887s">The</a> recent passing of Bill Mumbo-Katt here in the city of Medford, I think really highlights the fact that he is somewhat of a baseball legend, probably. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4159.935s">Medford</a> has been blessed with many, many baseball players, but this gentleman did it at a time back in the early 50s when he was practicing with a fellow by the name of Gus Hennessey. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4171.312s">And</a> they would go down and play Stead Park continuously. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4173.933s">And</a> he would just pitch to them and pitch to them and pitch to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4176.953s">And</a> eventually, he finally made it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4179.454s">But</a> he made it in a time and a period. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4182.014s">Eddie</a> Finn, you remember this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4183.414s">He</a> made it in a time that there was only eight professional baseball teams in either seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4187.075s">Now</a> there's 32. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4187.895s">But</a> there was only eight American League teams, eight National League teams. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4192.316s">And</a> it was tough. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4192.996s">And</a> when he went into the minors, he just didn't come up right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4195.757s">He</a> had to earn his spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4197.577s">And</a> he has a very interesting baseball career. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4201.45s">But</a> one of his real major accomplishments, and I don't even think he realized it until it happened, they were playing against the Washington Senators on a particular night. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4209.673s">And</a> I believe he had struck out 17 baseball, 17 players. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4214.875s">And</a> the coach of the Washington Senators, his name was William McCauley, came up to him toward the end of the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4222.158s">And</a> somebody wants to talk to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4223.659s">The</a> president wants to talk to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4224.679s">That's</a> the terminology. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4225.719s">The</a> president wants to talk to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4226.78s">And</a> he thought it was the president of the baseball team or the president of the league and this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4230.425s">But</a> it was Dwight Eisenhower. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4232.826s">And</a> Dwight Eisenhower was so impressed with him that he wanted a ball signed by him. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4237.527s">And</a> when the president asked him, where did you come from? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4240.288s">And</a> he says, Meffa. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4241.908s">Meffa.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4242.728s">And</a> it was sort of like, and he says, why do all you people down there talk like that? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4246.53s">I</a> mean, what do you? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4247.97s">And</a> it was kind of like, it was a cool situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4250.911s">But</a> the night he threw his no-hitter in Chicago on August 1, 1962 against a veteran, a very good veteran pitcher, early win. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4259.741s">That</a> was a real highlight here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4262.863s">No</a> one had ever thrown a, no one ever came from Medford to throw it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4267.225s">And</a> if I have my story correctly, I believe when he came back to Medford at that time, engine six drove him, picked him up and gave him somewhat of a mini parade here in the city of Medford, acknowledging the fact that who he was and how he was, you know, he was an all-star pitcher for the all-star teams for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4282.714s">He</a> played professional, he pitched professional baseball for 11 years between the Red Sox and the Yankees. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4289.385s">And</a> I guess his ending comment, which I happened to notice, and I'm glad that they printed it in the local press, he made the comment that he loved playing baseball so much that he would have played for nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4303.374s">And</a> if people only would realize what that would mean to today's kids that are playing professional sports, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4310.879s">They're</a> into the millions and millions of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4312.48s">I</a> believe when he was pitching, the year he threw the no-hitter, he was making $8,000, and I believe they offered him up to 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4319.126s">the</a> following year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4320.086s">And</a> that's just craziness for money back then. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4324.548s">And</a> if you look at him today, what his statistics would have been and what he could have probably earned, it's probably just unfathomable. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4330.771s">But</a> it's baseball as it was then. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4333.032s">That's</a> what they paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4333.872s">That's</a> what it was all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4335.473s">But</a> I think it would be a great opportunity for the Medford sports kids to know that this fellow grew up here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4342.576s">He</a> worked this thing into the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4344.957s">He</a> played it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4346.178s">He</a> loved it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4347.253s">He</a> used to come back and watch Medford High Baseball. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4349.214s">He</a> used to come back because of family members at Medford High School Hockey. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4355.058s">He</a> just really was a true gentleman to the sport. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4358.58s">He</a> wasn't flamboyant or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4361.221s">He</a> was just a regular guy who just proved here in the city of Medford and any place else in this country, if you work hard enough at something that you want, it'd be great by today's standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4369.286s">I</a> mean, like I said, I had a whole list of 32 names of people who <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4373.85s">made</a> professional sports through the minor leagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4376.331s">But</a> this guy made it in the majors. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4378.332s">And</a> he made it in such a way that nobody expected to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4381.234s">And</a> he just made the city of Medford so proud to know that, you know, he could accomplish what he did for the city of Medford, for professional baseball, because he loved it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4390.559s">And</a> like he said, he would have done it for nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4392.54s">And</a> you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4393.46s">He</a> probably did play for nothing, because that's how much he really loved the sport. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4397.302s">And</a> to his wife, Josephine, and the family, you know, you can be very proud of the fact that you had a great husband. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4402.972s">who</a> did the city of Medford proud, and you did him proud as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4406.293s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to pass that on. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4409.173s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4410.173s">Councilor</a> Knight?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4576.179s">He</a> was a real personal friend of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4578.261s">I</a> worked with him for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4580.282s">Unfortunately,</a> he passed away. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4582.264s">He</a> has a wonderful family, Sharon, Sam, Sawyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4586.967s">And</a> this is a tough one, because sometimes when life pops up in front of you and things happen, you just sometimes you don't know what to say or how to react to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4600.983s">He</a> loved the outdoors. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4602.104s">He</a> was great with the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4603.425s">He</a> was a coach. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4605.667s">He</a> was a great family man. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4608.589s">But</a> for whatever the reason that God decided to say, this is your time, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4613.112s">But</a> I would just like to let them know, and the Brown family, that their thoughts are at least with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4619.257s">He</a> was a good guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4620.018s">He</a> comes from a good family. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4622.039s">His</a> wife, Sharon, Sam Sawyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4628.208s">I</a> don't know what to say other than the fact that he was, you know, it was, it's one of these times in your life that something happens and you just can't explain it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4637.274s">And,</a> um, but I'm not going to try to explain it right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4639.995s">Other</a> than the saying, I just wish the family well at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4643.357s">We</a> all thank you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4692.801s">I</a> apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4693.461s">He</a> had three kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4694.322s">I</a> kept mentioning, I think I only said it too. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4696.043s">It's</a> Sam Sawyer and Sarah. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4698.785s">It's</a> Sarah, Sam and Sam. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4700.566s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4701.447s">Sam,</a> Sarah and Sawyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4705.129s">I'm</a> sorry.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5077.545s">Yeah,</a> well, the first day of the first storm. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5079.046s">Let's</a> put it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5080.427s">I</a> received a phone call from one of the president managing partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5082.989s">And</a> I had about a half hour conversation with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5085.171s">He</a> indicated to me that they are going to have five houses on the Medford side. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5089.094s">There</a> are going to be five houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5091.215s">And</a> with those five houses, I always said, I don't care what you're doing in Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5094.238s">I'm</a> more concerned of what's going to happen here in Medford, its effect, and how this is going to play out. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5099.802s">So</a> he is concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5101.263s">He</a> is aware of the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5102.443s">that</a> there was a concern because of the five houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5105.105s">So</a> I don't think, again, from my conversation, my take was, I don't think there's been that much involvement between the city and him, other than the fact that they're having this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5114.693s">Nothing</a> is definitive, but at the same time, they are aware that these five houses, which are less than what the original amount was gonna be, I believe it was either, I think it was nine, I don't think the original number was. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5127.423s">Seven,</a> was it? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5128.364s">Seven,</a> so it's down to five, but there's. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5131.623s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5131.903s">So</a> as a result of that, um, he is aware of the fact that Medford has a game, you know, a stake in this game and, and, uh, is that tomorrow night?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5743.346s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5744.987s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5745.907s">Quick</a> question on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5746.948s">On</a> this cell tower that's going up, this is the one with the red beacon on the top? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5750.99s">It's</a> not going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5752.09s">I</a> mean, it's up. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5752.571s">Is</a> this the one with the red beacon that goes off? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5754.852s">Are</a> there other towers that, I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5757.597s">sell</a> things on there like AT&T and Verizon, they aren't attached to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5762.459s">Because</a> if that's the case, we don't even know if they're being assessed, and that's tax revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5766.98s">So</a> maybe we can get a further report back from the building commission to find out if- As amended, if they're producing revenue?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5963.95s">I'd</a> like to hear from the gentleman, the citizen first. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5966.491s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5967.051s">He's</a> been waiting.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6367.223s">Thank</a> you, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6368.544s">Councilor</a> Penta? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6369.304s">Chief,</a> with all due respect to that decision that was made, the contract that was written on September 10th and then executed on October 7th with only a change of one word, both explicitly have a time zone in there of 7 to 7. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6385.616s">The</a> RFP that went out was 7 to 7. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6388.13s">The</a> three bidders that came in were 7 to 7. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6391.433s">That's</a> a material change to the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6395.216s">I</a> understand what you're saying.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6400.54s">I</a> would think in all fairness to the other bidders and the competitors that they probably should be advised now that the city of Medford is changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6408.387s">Because</a> I don't even know if the city is opening themselves up to a lawsuit here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6411.429s">Because</a> I think if I was one of the other competitors, I'd be very concerned over this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6416.067s">An</a> hour in the morning, an hour at night, six days a week, that's how many hours a week? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6420.931s">It's</a> 12 hours of enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6422.432s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6422.832s">That's</a> 12 hours that they're losing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6424.533s">That's</a> 48 hours a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6425.834s">Four</a> times, that's four months out of the week. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6428.096s">And</a> if they all had the same opportunity to bid the same way, OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6431.218s">Making</a> all these other changes, OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6432.92s">I</a> think you can live with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6434.421s">But</a> that's a material change. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6436.342s">That's</a> a huge change.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6456.298s">But</a> that's not as much as the material.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6484.329s">Well,</a> they were up there today.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6500.314s">You</a> bring up a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6501.275s">I</a> hope no city employee, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6502.788s">is</a> helping to shovel out any of those kiosks.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6527.945s">Chief,</a> there's a couple of, Mr. President, there's a couple of things I think that the taxpayers should be aware of as to what took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6534.871s">I</a> don't see anything wrong with reading them off and letting the people know what's going on, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6540.796s">So</a> if you don't want to read them, then I will read them.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6546.682s">No,</a> this is too important an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6547.923s">Don't</a> start with the minute thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6549.164s">We</a> did. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6549.464s">It's</a> too important of an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6552.066s">The</a> council recommendations regarding 15 Oh 22. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6555.893s">It</a> says meters must be shut off during non-enforcement time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6559.075s">The</a> answer is that the meters will read no charge parking period after hours on Sundays and federal holidays. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6567.959s">So</a> they're going to change the meter to do that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6600.565s">Next</a> one, it indicates that a 10 minute grace period be granted at the end of a time period. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6607.228s">The</a> answer is that per Republic parking, there was generally a five minute grace period from the time the vehicle takes note of expiration to the issuance of a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6615.473s">This</a> is due to the driver having to park his vehicle and walk to the sighted vehicle and then put information for the ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6621.596s">Now,</a> is this for kiosks or is this for signs?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6670.346s">Two</a> points that we had spoken about before last time was <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6673.577s">having</a> these kiosks in front of a residential apartment or a building. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6678.78s">The</a> one in West Medford, we had talked about putting it by the Brookline Bank, getting rid of the kiosks and putting a 30-minute sign period from here to corner and taking the one out in front of the apartment building.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6703.868s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6710.61s">You</a> also have it on High Street here in Medford, right opposite the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6714.391s">There's</a> a kiosk in front of the apartment building. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6717.291s">Makes</a> no sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6718.712s">There's</a> a kiosk in front of the apartment building.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6721.732s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6755.966s">So</a> then you would be penalizing any doctor or any emergency control type of person or a visiting nurse or somebody who <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6761.485s">doesn't</a> have an opportunity or right to park in the building down below, not knowing about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6765.507s">So</a> if they park in front of the building, they're going to get tagged and ticketed?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6792.882s">I</a> mean, you know, you don't want to hear the story about the library right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6796.343s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6846.767s">How</a> do you figure that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6851.31s">Yeah,</a> but they should be done intelligently.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6915.073s">Well,</a> you want to talk for two minutes or 43 seconds from the chair? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6919.675s">Number</a> three, Mr. President, um, tickets issued on January 15th and 16th to be waived. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6925.578s">The</a> answer is the individual has a right to appeal any ticket according to the lawful procedures. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6930.24s">Again,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6931.609s">I</a> think it's totally unfair, because we all know what happened on that particular day.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6951.519s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6951.679s">They</a> had nothing on there.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6963.971s">These</a> didn't have them on their chief.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7075.887s">Add</a> orange to the ticket color coded in an envelope. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7079.65s">Republic</a> says that they'll add orange to the ticket, but they're not going to have an envelope because it's, quote, it's sound environmental practice not to put an envelope. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7089.218s">And</a> that's kind of odd.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7107.803s">Then</a> it says asked to change the word from officer on ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7111.386s">And</a> they're not going to change it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7112.286s">They're</a> keeping the word officer.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7121.413s">Then</a> the next one on the next page is that reflective signs be placed on both sides of the kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7125.536s">It</a> says Republicans in the process <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7128.24s">of</a> ordering additional all-weather signs to affix, blah, blah, blah. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7131.282s">The</a> next one, that the license plate reader technology be used for the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7136.404s">Purchase.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7137.184s">Purchase.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7137.605s">The</a> answer from the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7138.545s">As</a> was mentioned at the city council meeting on January 20th, 2015, the council met with Republic earlier in the month regarding this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7145.108s">It</a> is currently in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7146.669s">And</a> as soon as more detailed information is available, you'll be provided with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7151.131s">What</a> does Republic have to do with this, with you people?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7181.57s">Another,</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7198.287s">On</a> that particular matter that Councilor Knight just brings up, Councilor Caraviello and myself had the opportunity to be at the MMA meeting and when there were five vendors there, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7208.166s">as</a> it relates to the model and make that we have here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7211.588s">And</a> I believe it was the distribution company for Republic that we were dealing with. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7215.55s">And</a> we got the cheapest, lowest grade model of a parking meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7219.172s">So</a> I just thought I'd let you know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7352.334s">I</a> think the question was both asked by us, just the two of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7355.596s">What</a> other options? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7356.396s">They</a> asked it to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7357.537s">Weren't</a> you shown these other options? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7359.077s">And</a> the answer had to be no. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7360.638s">And</a> how are you supposed to answer that? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7362.899s">We</a> were only shown one machine and that was it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8282.061s">Um,</a> on the last two matters here, uh, you're working on having a debit card allegedly that could correlate to the, uh, to the car, but they're unable to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8291.687s">And</a> then the last one detailed maps to be developed to show, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8294.787s">Spots</a> are available by type of spot in a residential or in a commuter business district. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8299.729s">Now,</a> I got a couple of phone calls from people up on Quincy Street at resident parking.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8339.17s">So</a> the three from that neighborhood all have the same issue then?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8363.921s">But</a> it also says that detailed maps are finalized and posted on Park Medford.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8380.037s">So</a> resident parking maps are not on there yet?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8412.822s">But</a> when you're doing these resident parking documents, maps or whatever they are.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8421.427s">But</a> some of the streets aren't all resident parking.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8425.709s">So</a> like you explained last week, um, Austin street, the number, it stops at a certain number. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8432.273s">I</a> mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8432.92s">How</a> are these people supposed to know?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8437.002s">Yeah,</a> but how does Republic know?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8513.172s">One</a> final thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8515.273s">I'd</a> like to, can we get a report back? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8517.174s">You</a> said the, um, the decision today by the city solicitor that you could change the hours.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9509.302s">I'd</a> like to send a, um, the council send some congratulations to, uh, not congratulations, some get well wishes to Rick Caraviello, his father, who unfortunately is in the hospital right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9518.884s">And,</a> uh, thank you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_Fcwn-qU-L9c/2025-03-21_Fcwn-qU-L9c.html">Medford City Council - January 20, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=247.913s">I'm</a> shocked that you didn't know four years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=249.835s">She's</a> following in the good footsteps of Jesse Jessalonis, who won that for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=254.698s">And</a> so we have an excellent tree history here in the city of Medford, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=258.601s">So,</a> Aggie, continue on, and good luck.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=741.47s">What</a> are we talking about?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=780.94s">My</a> question I think would become curious to the point that since it's not included specifically, if this would need a public advertisement to change the zoning to include it rather than come under the guys quote unquote of other institution in your other institution of what you're saying is an adult daycare center, which is not found under, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=802.025s">an</a> exact terminology as another institution.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=823.149s">Well,</a> that's what my concern would be, to give something out that wasn't properly vetted, so to speak, through rezoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=828.549s">I've</a> got no problem going forward with it, but I'd like to get a report back. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=832.285s">as</a> to whether this terminology, what are you calling an adult daycare center, since it's not found under the terminology of other institution can be included under the term other institution for the purposes of this particular vote.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=859.693s">whether</a> the zoning for an adult daycare center is legal terminology for other institutions, or does, in fact, a public hearing have to take place to make this become inclusive of other institutions?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=918.32s">ordinance</a> in itself, but all fairness to the council and anyone who watching and the petition is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=923.281s">I</a> don't have a letter that says that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=924.921s">So</a> if the building commissioner is the, um, I won't use the terminology zoning authority to make this inclusive of other institution. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=933.103s">I</a> think we should have had a letter that said that because it's obvious that we're operating other institution by including the terminology adult daycare center, um, LLC to be, to be included here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=945.667s">I'm</a> just protecting our interests, but more importantly, I want to make sure that the zoning is appropriate for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=950.75s">And</a> so nothing comes back and says, wait a minute, you know, it's not included. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=954.031s">It's</a> not the way it's supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=955.452s">I've</a> got no problem going forward with it, but I want that letter that says that this adult daycare center can be constituted as a legal entity under other institution on the unit than the use of it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1509.471s">Two</a> quick questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1510.311s">Um,</a> for people who might be watching, can you tell them where one-on-one Mr. Gav, what's that one-on-one Mr. Gav right now?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1524.621s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1526.062s">And</a> you indicated you could serve as 100 clients. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1528.204s">Is</a> that on the spot, or that during the course of the? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1530.426s">How</a> many can you actually have on that location at one time? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1533.568s">About</a> 100. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1535.73s">You</a> could have 100 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1537.291s">So</a> your 25 to 30 people could handle 100 people at any one time? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1542.775s">No</a> matter what their problems might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1545.456s">So</a> if anyone has probably a somewhat of a psychiatric type of a problem, you can handle that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1558.89s">But</a> how are you supposed to know that if somebody wants to apply?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1580.984s">But</a> this is for the purposes of anyone who might be watching so they have a better understanding.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1718.501s">Mr.</a> President, we all know that Dr. Lepore has an extreme interest in musical instruments because he plays one himself. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1726.043s">But</a> he started on this adventure a few years ago up at the State House when he had a bill introduced by Representative Paul Donato as it relates to the sterilization of musical instruments in schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1739.386s">The</a> bill, as reported out and signed by the governor on his last day in office, number 4384, states the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1747.588s">Upon</a> the issuance of a musical wind instrument to a borrowing student attending grades pre-kindergarten through 12 and any public <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1755.077s">or</a> commonwealth charter school, the issuing school shall inform the parent or guardian of the student that while the musical wind instrument was sanitized, it may also be sterilized in order to ensure that all microbiome life has been eradicated within the instrument. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1771.949s">Now,</a> we all know that there was a tremendous amount of concern as it relates to using pieces of instruments that children use in the public schools or charter schools <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1784.619s">or</a> public school administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1787.86s">Through</a> Tufts University, its medical school, and a whole host of medical individuals, the Federal Food and Drug Administration became very supportive once they recognized the fact that this has a legitimate concern, where they wrote, quote, we recognize that with respect to cross-contamination risks and the associated microbiological implications, musical wind instruments <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1813.971s">are</a> not unlike other contaminated medical dental devices. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1817.772s">It</a> states that a valid public health issue consistent with the universal precautions adhere to in the medical dental settings relative to instruments contaminated with bodily fluids. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1828.254s">And</a> as such, this agency, which is the FDA, believes that the classification of sterilized musical wind instruments falls under the jurisdiction of the Environmental Protection Agency and is simply concurring with the conventional medical wisdom that sterilizing items <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1843.678s">contaminated</a> with body fluids between uses is inappropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1847.76s">Now,</a> we all know that if you went to a restaurant, it would be absolutely inappropriate to use somebody else's fork, spoon, or drink from their glass because there are strict sterilization issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1858.624s">It's</a> the same thing you tell your kids not to use somebody else's toothbrush other than their own. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1865.607s">And</a> you can go and you can start making all these analogies as it relates to the misuse or the abuse that somebody might find themselves in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1873.567s">because</a> of the fact that something either wasn't sterilized or it wasn't brought to the parental attention for the purposes of letting them know that their children, to be safe, needs to have this stuff sterilized. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1885.55s">Restaurants</a> and hospitals follow strict public health rules and regulations and standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1891.011s">And</a> this was a long journey because it was sort of like virgin in the territories of people who just didn't understand this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1899.252s">Some</a> 25 years ago, you would never think of going to a dentist. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1902.886s">so</a> to speak, and he or she would put their fingers in your mouth without gloves. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1907.789s">And</a> ever since the fact that they now wear gloves, you would come to your attention immediately if you went to a dentist, male or female, and they decided to stick their finger in your mouth without a sterilized, whatever the color might be of the glove that they have to wear. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1923.62s">This</a> is a real big issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1926.501s">This</a> isn't a requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1927.542s">This</a> is a voluntarily <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1929.913s">encounter</a> that a parent will have now with their child who decides to want to use this instrument, or whatever the wind instrument might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1938.899s">I</a> think it was some two to three summers ago, there was a story in the Boston Globe that identified some 30,000 pieces of wind instruments being stored in the Boston public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1952.427s">And</a> as a result of that, having not been used for years, and as a result of that, and having the microbiological <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1960.505s">factor</a> come into play, showing that the danger that these kids would have by blowing these instruments is something that basically, again, accelerated not only Dr. Lepore's interest in this, but also the state legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1973.408s">And</a> I have to say publicly, if it wasn't for Representative Donato leading the charge in this on Beacon Hill, fighting this and introducing it each and every year for the last, I believe, four years up at the Statehouse for the purposes of educating <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1986.697s">his</a> fellow lawmakers, and having the governor not only accept it when he first came on, he authorized a, strike that, he entertained a commission for the purpose of not only reviewing it, but they wrote a report in 100% support of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2003.128s">So,</a> what I'd like to do, Mr. President, I'd like to invite Dr. Lepore to come here, and I think it would be a great acknowledgement to, again, one of our own, you know, kind of like Fortunate, we have it in the medical field, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2014.862s">We</a> have it in the legal field. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2015.963s">Most</a> recently, we have Victor Garrow, who received a nationwide award for his position of taking on a case for 30 years and defending somebody, proving that the gentleman was innocent and not guilty. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2026.607s">And</a> here we have another situation here where we have a renowned dentist here in our community who also happens to be a gentleman who plays a wind instrument, who saw the need for this to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2039.033s">He</a> saw the need for parents to be advised and become prepared. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2042.222s">And</a> he also saw the fact that an infectious disease, which is at the core of this whole thing, this is a prevention of infectious diseases, could be taking place and be corrected. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2054.188s">I</a> think that's a good thing for not only the city of Met, but for the entire Commonwealth of Massachusetts and anyone who wants to believe in the fact that, you know, this is a good, it's a good bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2063.352s">So</a> with that being said, I move, Mr. President, that Dr. Lepore be invited to come at a future date and he be duly recognized for the <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2071.747s">having</a> the bill passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2072.688s">And</a> you know something, I might even want to invite Representative Donato here, too, because this wasn't one of those easy bills that you can just get through. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2078.913s">A</a> lot of people sometimes couldn't understand it, don't understand the medical part of it, and you have a lot of new reps coming and going. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2084.858s">So</a> it took some time for the purposes of having this happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2087.52s">And</a> you had some opposition. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2088.44s">Yeah,</a> there was. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2088.921s">I</a> found it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2090.442s">But</a> he worked himself through it, and the legislature finally, and the governor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2094.946s">The</a> governor was on board right from the beginning, but the legislature finally saw through it, and it finally got itself passed.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2133.588s">Mr.</a> President, last week we had a, once again for the second week in a row, this is now running ourselves into the third week as it relates to this parking program that the mayor has initiated. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2143.23s">But</a> I think it's time we get a few issues straight right from the beginning because I don't want any misrepresentation to go out there before we get into our discussion as it relates to just what the council's position is on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2155.273s">Councilor</a> Camuso, you made some comments relative or earlier, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2158.785s">that</a> the council, on other occasions prior to this, voted, I believe you said, for a revenue, for a program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2166.233s">What</a> the council voted for... Can I, councillor? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2168.775s">Can</a> I finish my position, please?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2196.64s">I</a> don't think it's a matter of point of information.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2267.191s">Mr.</a> President, continuing on those votes at the council took all the council was for a traffic enforcement, not a revenue enhancement program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2275.796s">And</a> I think the records will verify that, but let's get right to the crux of the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2280.959s">On</a> May 20th on May 20th of this past year, we received a letter from the <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2287.637s">to</a> the president of the council from the mayor, but basically said that the parking management program, the authority intend to an agreement exceeding three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2296.082s">Dear</a> Mr. President, members of the council, the city of Medford has received proposals from various vendors in response to our request for proposals for a parking management program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2305.508s">It</a> is the intention of the city to enter a 10 year agreement with the successful proposal pursuant to the site and section of the law approved for the contract that exceeds three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2315.726s">Now,</a> following that step further, the mayor indicated that I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body, pursuant to the provisions of Massachusetts General Law Chapter 30, Section B12, approve and authorize the city of Medford to enter into an agreement with the successful proposal for a term signed by the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2333.43s">And</a> at that council meeting on the 20th, those that spoke were Mr. Rumley, Mr. Stirella, and Mr. D'Antonio. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2338.971s">That</a> resolution was amended by myself at the very end. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2341.851s">It</a> states, amended by Councilor Penta, that the mayor <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2345.807s">and</a> the preferred vendor meeting with the council to explain the program in depth prior to the final decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2352.531s">But</a> upon further review of the tape of that particular meeting, that was not the amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2358.314s">The</a> amendment was as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2360.115s">It</a> was to amend the motion that the council meet before the signing so that we have a complete understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2367.059s">So</a> as amended, that having the mayor, whoever the vendor might be, present themselves before the council <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2374.127s">before</a> the finalization of the contract, before the finalization of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2379.41s">So</a> why would the mayor want to, why would somebody want to come here before it was finalized? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2384.733s">If</a> in fact the mayor was going to sign it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2386.394s">Now</a> we met on September 10th at a committee of the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2389.856s">And</a> at that point in time, there was business folks that and Councilors that pushed back from the contract that was being presented to us at that time from the people who were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2399.862s">And</a> at that point in time, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2401.515s">The</a> mayor decided to listen to all the things, left the room, and said he would come back with further. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2408.098s">And</a> when he came back further was with no vote by the council to discuss what took place by way of an amendment or by way of extras or what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2417.502s">As</a> a result of that, there's been some, I guess, misinformation being scuttled out there as it relates to just does where this Medford City Council stand. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2428.707s">This</a> Medford City Council had two proposals that took place on that May 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2433.49s">On</a> that May 20th, we had A, we'd bring in one of the three vendors, for which it happened to be Republic, and B, we would get a report back if the city was to do it on its own with the financial breakdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2444.837s">We</a> never had an opportunity to vote on that one way or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2447.679s">The</a> council's position, other than the fact, saying that the mayor has the authority to sign it, he does have the authority to sign it, but we never had the finalization of what was being presented to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2456.757s">So</a> what I'm offering here right now is the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2459.158s">It's</a> a resolution that the Medford City Council take their official position as to whether they support Mayor McGlynn's pay-to-park kiosk revenue enhancement program with the Republic Company from Tennessee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2469.461s">Very</a> simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2470.361s">Either</a> you're for it or you're against it so people have a clear understanding of where we all are. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2475.282s">You</a> can't one week turn around and say you're for it and another week you're against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2479.363s">And</a> I don't want to hear from Councilor Caraviello calling me up and telling me that the people are saying that I'm saying something about him. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2484.897s">vice</a> versa. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2485.778s">It</a> doesn't go that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2486.658s">My</a> comments have been pretty consistent and I'll say that in front of anyone that wants to challenge me to what I say. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2492.203s">That's</a> the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2493.624s">There</a> it is, Mr. Clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2494.885s">I'd</a> like to have the council vote on it and then we can continue on talking about it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2512.997s">Just</a> for the clarification... Took what vote, Mr. Paul? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2514.938s">We</a> didn't have no vote.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2547.121s">Point</a> of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2548.79s">what</a> the council voted for, seven to nothing, and I will agree to that, because that's what I voted on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2553.031s">That's</a> what I, to allow him to go forward and to negotiate with Republicans. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2557.712s">That's</a> what I wanted to do, and report back to the council before it was finalized for us to review it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2587.832s">I'm</a> talking about the meeting that took place on May 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2591.436s">To</a> get those three vendors to come back, to get those three vendors to come back, you had to send the request out.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2602.206s">You</a> didn't even know about it until September 10th, when you got it for the first time.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2626.688s">Mr.</a> President, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2628.549s">I</a> move the question, Mr. President, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2630.311s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2634.293s">I'm</a> asking for the clerk.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2649.273s">Let's</a> do this one first. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2651.196s">And</a> then we have 022 before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2654.567s">I</a> am taking out of my resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2657.768s">I'm</a> filing this motion out of my resolution.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2715.027s">Point</a> of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2716.348s">Wait</a> a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2717.049s">I'm</a> not arguing that we didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2718.37s">We</a> took the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2719.39s">We</a> all took the vote to go out for an RFP, and we all took the vote for the mayor to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2724.334s">We</a> never took a final vote, as you voted for.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2758.33s">Mr.</a> President... The resolution's very simple.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2798.141s">That's</a> the reason- So like I said, Mr. President- Well, ask Councilor Caraviello the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2802.182s">You</a> even said you thought you were coming back to take a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2804.542s">Did</a> you not say that? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2805.942s">Councilor-</a> Thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2807.062s">There</a> he is right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2807.923s">He</a> just-
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3877.209s">Councilor</a> Caraviello, point of information, Councilor Panto. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3881.726s">What</a> Councilor Camuso is saying is only 50% true because the RFP that went out also included the RFP on questions that came back from the three vendors. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3891.472s">We</a> as a council had no way of knowing what those questions and how they were going to be answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3895.754s">Councilor</a> Knight rightfully brought up the fact of the private vendor making the signs when that's a contract issue here with people who work for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3904.94s">But</a> the dual part of the story is that we asked for the city to make its presentation <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3910.687s">if</a> the city, in fact, was going to be the person that was going to put the kiosk or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3916.43s">And</a> that's the reason why this Medford City Council voted seven to nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3920.091s">And</a> I'm quite sure the clerk in his minutes that took place in the executive session will attest to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3926.254s">Councilor</a> Caraviello?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3997.229s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3998.991s">Those</a> votes that were taken were for traffic enforcement, not revenue enhancement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4004.056s">Read</a> all the resolutions.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4058.34s">point</a> of personal privilege. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4059.861s">Since</a> you mentioned my name, let's get it straight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4062.062s">I</a> don't think the clerk has got to go down. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4063.603s">You've</a> already identified the fact that an RFP went out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4065.984s">We</a> have no argument with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4067.405s">You</a> also identified the fact that the mayor asked to go forward with one of the three vendors. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4072.468s">So</a> those are your two votes right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4074.108s">Those</a> are the only two votes that this council took on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4076.71s">But</a> the amendment, the amendment to the vote to go forward was predicated on bringing in A, the city's cost of what it would be, and B, a finalization before the council, before a contract was signed.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4089.116s">Listen,</a> you don't have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4090.117s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4090.757s">All</a> you have to do is watch the tape, ladies and gentlemen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4092.958s">It's</a> as clear as the bell.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4167.099s">Just</a> mention my name again. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4168.899s">If</a> he has a vendetta, if he has a vendetta out for me, why don't you just tell the public that, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4172.86s">You're</a> a lame duck councillor, so your words, you can say anything you want about me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4176.201s">It</a> means absolutely nothing, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4179.442s">Well,</a> you can do it all you want in election time, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4181.883s">And</a> I'll do all I want during this period. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4184.443s">And</a> I know what I'm saying because this does not lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4187.824s">And</a> if you watch a councillor, that doesn't lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4190.505s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4227.685s">I</a> didn't mention my name. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4232.089s">You</a> certainly did. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4232.79s">You</a> just said Councilor Pantus. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4234.091s">I</a> said Councilor Pantus. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4236.373s">It's</a> my resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4238.075s">So</a> could you tell him to please be quiet and let somebody speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4243.633s">Rick,</a> not for anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4245.334s">If</a> everybody was so opposed to it, then according to Councilor Camuso, we should have never ever voted for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4250.916s">So,</a> you can't have it both ways.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4261.999s">No,</a> we didn't.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4268.312s">We</a> kind of get duped into something that never came to for a final vote.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4279.643s">And</a> there's the answer right there.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4389.107s">Question.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4394.409s">Then</a> the question is this, as a member of the chamber, did you vote for this or not when the board of directors voted, yes or no?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4717.924s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4719.005s">I</a> want to, I want to get to your question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4720.687s">You</a> just said,
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4722.961s">Point</a> of information? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4723.681s">Yeah,</a> point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4724.622s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4726.343s">There</a> are two opt-out positions in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4727.943s">After</a> 90 days, if this is not working out for either party, there's opt-out provisions, and there's an opt-out provision at the end of the first year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4734.787s">So</a> I just thought I'd let you know we don't have to live with this for 10 years.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4737.988s">And</a> I'm quite sure there's going to be a whole host of legal questions that are going to arise that maybe Republicans are not going to want to entertain, because maybe they're just going to say this isn't worth it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5409.985s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5411.866s">Mr.</a> Nash, question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5414.227s">Tony,</a> I'm sorry, this is... I'm following this conversation as it relates, I believe he's alluding to using a kiosk, but if I drive down the street and I see a sign that says two-hour parking, and there's no kiosk, there's nothing, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5429.009s">How</a> are you going to know who got there at what time and when? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5432.131s">You're</a> not going to. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5432.991s">That's</a> the whole point.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5468.277s">So</a> they all work the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5469.237s">No</a> matter what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5470.357s">If</a> I drive down the street and I see a half-hour parking area, and there's no kiosk, there's nothing, just the signs, there's a half-hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5476.839s">How</a> are you going to know what time I got there? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5479.019s">Because</a> you're driving around the city doing all this other enforcement.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5499.502s">But,</a> Dan, I mean, I could be sitting there for an hour or two before you eventually get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5502.623s">Of</a> course you can.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6556.672s">Why</a> would you want to sever it? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6557.393s">Why</a> don't you just include it? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6558.294s">Because</a> when you have the discussion next week, you'll have your answers.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6573.487s">Well,</a> all you're keeping open is the conversations you're going to be able to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6577.09s">That's</a> what the resolution would say. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6578.411s">So</a> I would be willing to. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6581.133s">That</a> doesn't make sense to me, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6582.574s">Oh,</a> why doesn't it? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6583.115s">I</a> have some amendments that I'd like to put forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6585.977s">Well,</a> then this will be tremendously amended then. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6588.939s">Well,</a> whether it's amended or not, what difference does it make? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6591.101s">It's</a> part of the ongoing discussion, Fred. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6593.162s">It's</a> all there is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6593.663s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6638.094s">No,</a> just table it until you get the answer.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6723.748s">We've</a> had many resolutions that are amended on the floor.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6731.051s">With</a> a number on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6731.511s">And</a> then I said, as amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6733.052s">As</a> amended, and I handed it to him.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6747.417s">Let's</a> withdraw it and see how the answer is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6749.467s">Before</a> we go any further, before we get to that, I want to go back to the amendments that we're discussing here right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6755.048s">I</a> want to go to indicate that on, is Mr. Nash, you're still here? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6760.67s">Dan.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6770.812s">Are</a> the cars, the two cars that you have right now, are they lettered yet properly? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6774.613s">Are</a> they done? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6775.393s">Pardon</a> me? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6775.953s">Nope.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6777.214s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6777.654s">And</a> have they been used? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6779.167s">recently</a> for the purposes of issuing tickets? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6782.708s">Nope.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6783.389s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6784.229s">And</a> when we met, I believe it was on this past Friday, you indicated that the cars would not be used for that particular purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6790.412s">They</a> would just be driving your drivers around and they would be getting out and doing what they're doing.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6798.215s">I</a> move that the dates of January 15th and January 16th, any tickets and issued <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6805.387s">You</a> amend the amended further with another amendment, further amended by Councilor Penta that the tickets issued on the January 15th and especially January 15th where the cars were unlicensed, unregistered and unserved checked and unleaded, uh, not be, uh, be waived. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6824.021s">And</a> same thing for the 16th. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6826.963s">Um,</a> and also number two, there was no clarity into what you just said. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6830.886s">Councilor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6831.347s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6832.027s">You</a> can't understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6833.872s">And</a> the 16th, the same for the 15th and the 16th. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6836.636s">Any</a> tickets that they issued be invalid, because they were used in a car that wasn't properly marked, insured, registered, and inspected.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6854.155s">What</a> day were they insured, Dan? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6855.435s">I</a> don't have that documentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6856.256s">You</a> don't have it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6863.219s">You</a> had a cardboard plate that said Tennessee on the back of a white car that did not have a Massachusetts registration. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6869.801s">It</a> wasn't inspected. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6870.982s">And</a> it wasn't leaded and identified. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6872.763s">That's</a> what the contract says you were supposed to do.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6878.903s">Therefore,</a> with that being said, tickets given on those two days, and they're still unalerted vehicles, but I understand what he's doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6886.108s">They're</a> just driving the people around. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6887.629s">So</a> the tickets that were given on those two days be waived. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6890.531s">That's</a> all.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6928.381s">But</a> you had to use that vehicle, Dan, to get to where you were going. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6930.983s">If</a> the chief of police drove down the street and saw my car that was uninspected, unregistered, and didn't have a Massachusetts plate on it for the purposes of an unleaded, he would stop me and give me a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6943.309s">He</a> didn't have it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6950.526s">Well,</a> you would have not been able to get the information, Dan, from the orange things on top of those vehicles from the guys driving down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6957.087s">Correct?</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7010.238s">But</a> Dan, he would have never been able to do whatever those violations were on that, at least on the 15th, on the 15th, if he didn't have, if the car was properly, it was like it was supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7019.164s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7020.365s">We</a> could have.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7077.394s">On</a> that matter, how can you override something without coming to City Hall? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7083.178s">You</a> can do that where you're at? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7085.219s">Well,</a> with your permission, I'll do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7086.7s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7086.78s">I</a> don't know which way you want me to do it, and you don't want me to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7089.321s">I</a> hope the council agrees to give permission to avoid the tickets, OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7095.266s">the</a> council is not authorized to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7097.047s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7097.428s">But</a> he can do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7098.649s">Second</a> thing on the tickets, is there any way instead of having a paper ticket, you can put a color ticket on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7104.374s">Um,</a> yes, that's already been brought up in work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7106.836s">But</a> I just want to know, cause it's not part of the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7109.898s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7110.178s">I</a> like to make a part of the, there are a couple of solutions to that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7114.582s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7114.762s">I</a> like to amend it that the, the, the violations be color coded. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7118.245s">So,</a> and not, and not in paper council and not on paper.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7183.719s">Last</a> two points, to get it corrected, because this is the question that was asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7188.581s">Once</a> you give a ticket and somebody appeals the ticket, do they have to pay the ticket first or do they have the appeal and after the appeal it's taking place? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7196.765s">No,</a> they do not have to pay the ticket first. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7197.965s">They</a> do not have to pay the ticket in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7199.706s">And</a> the last thing, Chief, did you realize on the ticket they have the word officer? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7203.087s">Why</a> are they using the word officer? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7205.912s">Can</a> that word be changed?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7209.914s">It</a> says officer on it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7218.279s">Anyone</a> see the words officer gives a representation of a police officer, and they're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7222.321s">They're</a> not supposed to give anything that represents the city of Medford Fire, Police, or any type of representation.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7268.603s">No,</a> I think the urge is to have, after 90 days, they should have been prepared for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7273.565s">That's</a> the urge.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7275.886s">Well,</a> they had them for 30 days.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7278.647s">Chief,</a> they had 90 days to get them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7280.888s">They</a> said it in their contract, 90 days, Fred. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7283.109s">90</a> days. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7284.99s">I</a> amend the motion that the word officer be replaced on the tickets.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7296.929s">And</a> also that the ticket, if somebody gets a ticket, it's color coded. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7300.349s">And</a> would you say with the return address envelope?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7440.456s">So</a> let's wrap it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7444.378s">Wait</a> a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7445.778s">You</a> want to rush? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7446.518s">Relax.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7448.079s">This</a> is too important of an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7449.48s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7450.56s">Number</a> one, after seven o'clock at night, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7453.623s">Dan,</a> you indicated that you're going to have a special team go out after seven o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7457.784s">What</a> does it say that in the contract?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7524.885s">I</a> understand the seven to seven, but I don't understand how they can work after seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7529.027s">I</a> mean, and as far as their, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7531.177s">financial</a> windfall that comes out of all of that, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7533.499s">And</a> number two, how are you going to read in the dock? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7535.2s">How</a> are they going to read number plates in the dock?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7541.785s">But</a> when cars are parked close together, Chief, what are they going to get out of the car?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7563.863s">I</a> think it was mentioned at the Committee of the Whole meeting that it cost about $30,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7566.885s">Is</a> that what it is for those things to be on top of those cars? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7570.167s">Is</a> that what it is, Dan?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7590.305s">Well,</a> since we have approximately $7 million in free cash, I'm going to move that the city's police department be afforded an opportunity to investigate what the cost would be to install them in your cruises.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7626.255s">In</a> the effort to eliminate redundancy, why don't we withdraw that amendment? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7628.777s">No,</a> I'm going to put it on there as an amendment.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9138.324s">Yeah,</a> Jane, the thing that I appreciate the fact is you put a lot of effort and time <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9143.302s">and</a> making a presentation of what you thought you believed in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9145.483s">You</a> know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9146.023s">But</a> the city has a responsibility, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9147.844s">So</a> this is where I'm going to digress from Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9150.145s">I</a> don't think you have to go out there and start and do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9152.846s">We</a> have a community development office who's yet to even walk these streets here in the city of Medford to find out a knock on the business doors, like the mayor, failing to find out what's going on, what's the problem, what do you think would be a better situation here for the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9168.473s">What</a> would you like to see to be done? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9170.118s">So</a> with that being said, I think the city has a big obligation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9173.82s">It's</a> bad enough they're taxing people to death with food tax, and sales tax, and excise tax, and water and sewer tax, and real estate tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9181.624s">And</a> now you have this new crazy kiosk tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9186.326s">And</a> now you want the business people to go ahead and create something that the city should be doing themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9191.829s">If</a> they want development to take place, if they wanted to be proactive, they'd be out there, just like Summerville was proactive, just like Winchester's proactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9199.376s">just</a> like Arlington is proactive, just like Lexington is proactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9203.46s">We</a> don't have to be those communities, but we can be proactive between and amongst ourselves within our own communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9209.723s">And</a> a lot of people look at West Mefford, you happen to mention it, so I'll mention West Mefford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9213.865s">It's</a> a close-knit group of people, they work together, they look out for each other, and it's a type of business where one feeds off of another. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9222.268s">They're</a> not Newbury Street, it's just a mom and pop type of community within our own city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9228.271s">But</a> all four sections of the city are like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9230.332s">Mefford</a> Square is different. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9231.752s">All</a> four sections of the city are like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9233.727s">And</a> once the city wakes up and decides to figure out that they need to fix potholes, they need to understand that business people need to survive, and they can't keep taxing them to that, especially when you're sitting on almost $15 million of revenue surplus and a water and sewer account and free cash, and now you're trying to tax them again with this craziness of a kiosk tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9254.615s">It's</a> wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9255.055s">In</a> my opinion, it's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9256.416s">I</a> think the city needs to wake up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9258.118s">And</a> it's obvious that the mayor, listen, if the mayor had any respect for this council and for you, he would have sent somebody, he would have sent something to the president of this council and told them, unfortunately, I'm not going to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9268.16s">I'm</a> on vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9269.56s">Could</a> you please cancel the meeting for another week? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9271.48s">But</a> no, he didn't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9273.201s">He</a> knew in advance, they knew in advance he wasn't going to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9276.121s">It</a> was a wasted night, unfortunately, for all the people that showed up, but hopefully the chief got the message and got the idea that there were still concerns out there that need to be corrected. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9284.423s">And</a> I stand by my resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9286.164s">And</a> when I introduce it next week, I do not support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9288.946s">Because</a> I do not think it's right for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9291.007s">It's</a> not the right step to go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9292.447s">And</a> I think it should have started with the city taking on the responsibility first before we do anything by bringing in an outside company. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9298.911s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9476.093s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9477.234s">Yeah,</a> Jean, don't go away, because my opinion is going to be a little different than Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9481.838s">I</a> wish he mentioned me by name, because that's who I know he was referring to. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9484.861s">But</a> I think government does have a role. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9486.221s">I</a> think government has a responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9487.942s">When</a> they tax the people in this community, or in any community, to do something and to be part of the community, they have a responsibility to go out there and work within the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9496.223s">And</a> when you don't see them, and when you don't hear from them, and when you see businesses closing down one at a time, one at a time, and one at a time in Medford Square, and you still not see city government going out there trying to find out what the problem is, what the reason is, that's the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9509.766s">It's</a> government not doing its job. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9512.166s">You</a> can do all the job you want to help out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9514.047s">It's</a> commendable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9515.188s">But</a> you still need government to help you out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9516.848s">And</a> if you don't want government to help you out, then you shouldn't even be standing here tonight, because it won't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9522.37s">It</a> takes two to tango. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9523.69s">But</a> before it takes two to tango, we have to remember one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9526.511s">Jim</a> Silver and Smartco and South Metro, it was because of those people being persistent, being persistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9535.933s">Because</a> if the city was doing its job, he wouldn't have had to been so persistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9541.234s">And</a> thankfully, the chief was there on a particular night <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9543.991s">And</a> he walked the neighborhood with them to see what was going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9546.772s">He</a> is an exemplary person as a municipal employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9550.914s">If</a> all the department heads acted like him, we'd have no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9553.755s">You</a> wouldn't even need a mayor because everybody would be doing their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9556.897s">The</a> guy goes over and beyond the call of duty. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9559.398s">This</a> is not his job, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9560.919s">His</a> job is to be the chief of police, to make sure our community is safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9564.68s">He</a> should not have to be the parking commissioner, so to speak, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9569.382s">But</a> unfortunately, the mayor <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9572.401s">God</a> bless you chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9573.342s">Why</a> are you doing it? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9574.443s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9575.604s">I</a> don't think you deserve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9577.345s">And</a> I just think there's a perfect example of government not being responsible for what they're supposed to be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9583.25s">This</a> is the mayor's program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9585.572s">This</a> is the mayor's program, not the chief or the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9587.914s">This</a> is the mayor's program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9589.315s">And</a> if he wants to go on vacation for which he's entitled to, then we should have been given the respect that he wasn't going to be here tonight by the people in his office who knew he wasn't going to be here because everybody that showed up early tonight expected him to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9601.375s">And</a> that's the message that went out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9602.677s">And</a> that was the vote of the city council last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9604.9s">Seven,</a> seven to nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9606.403s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10576.365s">Yeah,</a> it's interesting because this Medford city council was in the forefront of wanting to be a surrounding community contender right from the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10585.468s">And</a> I think there is maybe five to six resolutions that were offered on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10589.889s">Myself</a> included along with council Longo current as it related to getting ourselves on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10594.965s">And</a> the interesting part about all of this, I think we sent resolutions to the Mass Gaming Commission, and I believe we also sent one to the Commonwealth of Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10602.99s">I</a> think it was the Attorney General's Office that needed to go there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10607.073s">Bottom</a> line to all of that is we had asked the mayor on numerous occasions to be part of the surrounding community application. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10615.058s">Not</a> only did he ignore us, but he also went forward and did whatever he did to subsequently reach, I think it was $250,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10623.085s">and</a> money thus far from the Wynn Casino group of people who made the application to the Mass Gaming Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10629.45s">Putting</a> all of that aside, we now have a situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10632.952s">We</a> have, and I don't know if this is called mitigation money, I don't know what the proper terminology is, but if we have the ability to have $100,000 come to us, whether it be for use for the Wellington area, whether it's the First Street, whether it's for flooding. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10645.542s">Once</a> again, I'd like to amend the motion that the mayor consult with the council as it relates <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10651.413s">for</a> the purposes of using this money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10653.635s">There's</a> no sense in you being on the committee, Rick, that the mayor just appointed you to, if the money is going to wind up going for whatever he wants to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10660.68s">All</a> you are going to be doing is a conduit to bring the money into the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10664.703s">And</a> again, it's another example, if the mayor doesn't want to participate with the council in our request, then it's for naught. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10670.487s">We're</a> just giving him carte blanche to do whatever he wants whenever he gets this money.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10684.467s">We'll</a> make the specific thing for the Wellington neighborhood, whether it's for the rotary intersection or to decrease the water.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10693.114s">Well,</a> the multiple issues got to come from the council.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10699.318s">We're</a> talking about this $100,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10700.039s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10700.399s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10700.639s">What</a> do you want it to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10703.201s">Councilman,</a> you brought it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10704.422s">What</a> is your suggestion? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10706.543s">Mike?</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10767.422s">February</a> 2nd is right around the corner.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10772.264s">Well,</a> the council resolution go forward as amended.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10845.271s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10846.531s">Point</a> of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10847.291s">Councilor</a> Marks, I mean, Councilor Knight, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10849.926s">brings</a> up an interesting point, but the city some years ago did apply for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10853.507s">And</a> they put a request in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10854.847s">I</a> think it was for, I think it was almost $80,000, $90,000 at one time for the purposes of having a transportation, I won't use the word consultant, a transportation person upstairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10864.93s">And</a> I think we got the idea because of what Somerville was doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10867.711s">And</a> at that point in time, I believe Somerville had 14 people in their office of community development and how they were getting so efficient is they hired an outside professional person <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10875.57s">to</a> be their transportation consultant. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10877.592s">I</a> think that's one of the people that made the takeoff of the piece of property over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10881.274s">I've</a> got no problem supporting them there, but these are all, I think, budgetary issues, because if you take that money from the $100,000, you've got to keep that position going each and every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10892.664s">I</a> like the idea of bringing it up again, but I think it's just, you know, I think it's just something that this whole budget has to be looked at as to where we're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10900.249s">Each</a> and every year we wind up in the last four years with a million dollar surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10904.392s">So</a> we know that there is money there to hire additional people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10907.595s">The</a> school committee just got an additional two and a half million dollars this year, and they've hired many more administrators, more than we've able to do on this side of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10916.001s">So</a> something's got to make the turn. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10918.207s">that</a> gets to where you're talking about, Councilor Knight, what Councilor Marks was talking about, where this city should be moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10924.291s">Everybody's</a> moving forward around us, and all we're doing is just staying still and becoming stagnant, and that's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10930.575s">It</a> shouldn't be that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10931.896s">We're</a> not a poor city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10933.477s">We</a> are financially endowed right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10935.758s">We</a> have good money, and we should be investing it in good projects, not just keep increasing, taxing the people, and just keeping the coffers, and just filling them up and filling them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10946.385s">It</a> just doesn't work that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10948.079s">And</a> our best example is our sister city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10950.281s">Just</a> look at Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10951.141s">Years</a> ago, people... Years ago, I wouldn't want to move to Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10955.284s">Now,</a> you can't even get into Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10957.525s">You</a> can't even touch the real estate in Somerville.<h2><a href="../2024-10-16_QTGph9EVRy4/2024-10-16_QTGph9EVRy4.html">Medford, MA City Council - Oct. 7, 2014 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1109.584s">Mr.</a> President, I think in part we all know that around 5 o'clock or 5.30 this evening, I think we received the mayor's press release. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1120.506s">that</a> he'd signed the contract with Republic from Tennessee. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1123.708s">But</a> I'll get to that later on. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1125.17s">It's</a> still part of the comparison. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1127.672s">You</a> know, when we came on board at the beginning of the year, we were asked to give what our priorities were. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1131.515s">And</a> I believe the police department and police station was our number one priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1136.018s">And</a> unfortunately, it hasn't found itself anywhere in any of the mayor's agendas. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1141.803s">Now,</a> the police station would derive an extreme benefit for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1147.027s">It</a> would make us go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1149.571s">not</a> only socially, but as a community going forward with tomorrow's technology, and it would also give a presence of community policing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1160.516s">And</a> that's something I think a lot of the people asking for, more police officers, more patrolmen, more visibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1167.699s">And</a> if you give them a better place to work out of, then I think that would go a long way. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1174.341s">You</a> know, we paid in excess, I think, of $78,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1178.979s">when</a> we received the feasibility study from the police department and the fire department on May 5th of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1185.881s">And</a> unfortunately for the police department, they didn't get anything out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1189.182s">Fire</a> department did, but the police department didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1192.864s">And</a> once again, I don't know, maybe it's just the mayor, he doesn't have it on his radar screen, but public safety, I believe is the first of priorities here of any of all the councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1204.168s">Some</a> of the things that Mr. Mayor, that would be beneficial, not only for our community, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1209.378s">is</a> the council has supported, in each and every calendar budget, the recycling of two new cruises each and every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1218.363s">And</a> that would go a long way, once again, to add to the police officers on duty, driving their cruises, letting them know that the city is thinking about them, and they don't have to drive in a car that has about 140,000 miles on it, and they don't know if it's gonna make it or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1233.892s">I</a> think it was Councilor Marks, three years ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1238.24s">came</a> up with the idea of why can't we have a special truck enforcement unit? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1241.321s">It's</a> a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1243.522s">What's</a> wrong with training one or two people to be involved with truck enforcement for that particular purpose? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1249.584s">Because</a> I think we can go down any one of these streets in any one of these days, and we see the amount of trucks that travel down High Street, Main Street, or the major streets here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1258.407s">That</a> would go a long way. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1260.588s">In</a> our public safety issue regarding lighting, all the squares are just dimly lit. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1266.069s">And</a> that in and of itself is an invitation <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1268.356s">for</a> some type of crime, whatever the crime might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1271.358s">You</a> get Route 16, the parking lot behind St. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1274.16s">Joe's.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1274.981s">This</a> will probably be the 14th time that we've discussed this, and still no lighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1280.045s">We've</a> had situations there where a lady called up and she was afraid to get into a car because of people there, and also in a separate situation where a drug transaction was reported. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1289.572s">Also</a> right here in Medford Square, the Route 16 overpass, underpass on Route 93, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1294.71s">has</a> no lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1296.091s">Riverside</a> Avenue, go underneath the overpass there, still no lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1300.812s">We</a> have asked for the issue of public safety, timely street swiping. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1305.514s">We've</a> also asked for our crosswalk painting. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1308.095s">You're</a> lucky if you see that once a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1310.856s">These</a> aren't huge cost items. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1312.756s">These</a> are items that are readily available within our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1316.538s">Now</a> we've talked about police cameras and high visibility locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1321.151s">Were</a> it not for the business merchant that owned a store on the corner of George and Winthrop Street a few years, a couple of years back, how they caught the guy that assaulted the young lady from Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1333.255s">And</a> as a result of that, Mr. President, we all know that the cameras are beneficial. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1338.22s">We</a> have $8,893 in our linkage account for where they could buy a few cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1343.764s">But</a> if you really want to get into it, we have $6,400,000 in our free cash account. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1348.967s">So</a> I don't think there should be any reason why we can't go out there and buy any cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1354.371s">A</a> bonus to our people that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1357.433s">We</a> can review the one day a week and swap day reward. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1361.095s">And</a> that would be for those officers with a perfect attendance for six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1365.238s">Something</a> different, something creative for the police officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1368.706s">rather</a> than the annual, it's on a six month basis, and that might work out, it's a tryout, it's something to think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1376.55s">I</a> think we should also think about revisiting the idea of having retired police personnel be part of the parking enforcement proposal here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1384.815s">Because</a> that in and of itself, that in and of itself would bring a big luxury, not only to the people here in this community, but I think to the business people who would have a better idea of knowing <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1397.748s">when</a> and how to tag certain folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1400.089s">Because</a> we really don't know what this out-of-state company from Tennessee is going to be like. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1404.952s">They</a> could just be, I don't know, they're going to start at 7 o'clock in the morning to 7 at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1408.674s">It</a> doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1410.115s">Boston</a> doesn't even start till 8 o'clock in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1413.217s">We</a> have a civil defense system that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1416.418s">Since</a> Mr. Mangone has passed on as its civil defense director, I don't know where it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1422.242s">Is</a> it in limbo? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1423.122s">Is</a> it going to be used? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1424.503s">If</a> not, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1425.657s">We've</a> talked about a snow emergency system, and we haven't heard anything back on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1429.099s">And</a> I think we're all aware of the fact that a snow emergency system of some type needs to be in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1436.545s">And</a> taking some of these issues and putting them on the left, then I go to the right, and I look at this idea of this new proposal that, if you agree or disagree, the mayor signed into effect apparently today regarding this Tennessee firm Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1455.834s">regarding</a> a traffic enforcement program that's going to be six days a week from 7 in the morning to 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1462.839s">at</a> night. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1463.619s">There'll</a> be no free parking on the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1465.921s">According</a> to the mayor's commentary, there's going to be two 30-minute parking spots in each one of the squares, and there'll be four paid single-space meter spots in each of the four square districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1481.652s">Other</a> than that, there'll be kiosks allotted. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1485.652s">It's</a> kind of like interesting because if you look at the commentary made by the director from the Medford Chamber of Commerce, Mr. White, he indicated that he was hoping that he would have an opportunity with its members to sit down and discuss this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1500.196s">And</a> he also made reference to the fact that each and every one of the squares have unique positions, unique concerns as it relates to businesses and how they might be affected. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1509.459s">How</a> the mayor came up to this resolution and signing, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1513.459s">But</a> it's kind of like unfair because we were in that meeting on September 10th, and we were told that he would get back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1520.742s">We</a> were told that there'd be a public meeting for which this council voted seven to nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1524.724s">He</a> never honored that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1526.345s">We</a> were told also that the concerns that would be brought up would be addressed and to have an idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1531.767s">I</a> don't know, and we don't really know what part of the business community, what businesses are going to be exempt from not having a meter or a kiosk anywhere in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1543.066s">You</a> take these two things and you ask yourself, the Medford Police Department and public safety is such a huge issue here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1550.709s">And</a> some of the samples that I just talked about still have yet to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1554.971s">But</a> the mayor thinks it's more important to go forward with a parking enforcement program, strike that, a paid to park program with enforcement that's only going to bring in $300,000 the first year and $700,000 from the second to the ninth year, it's the 10th year. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1572.406s">May</a> sound like a lot of money, but my feeling personally would have been, had the city decided to go forward after that meeting on the 10th, having an opportunity to listen to the folks within our community, listen to the business in the community, all four areas of this community, rather than have one size fits all, which includes Medford Square, in the press release as outlined tonight at 510, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1599.947s">I</a> just don't think it serves in the best interest of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1603.148s">I</a> don't think it helps our police department, and I don't think it gives the community in and of itself a fair shot as it relates to priorities that need to be addressed rather than another money enhancement for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1617.853s">Mr.</a> President, today, as you know, I'm assuming all of you know that the mayor signed this contract tonight around 517 or thereabouts. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1628.397s">He</a> signed the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1629.758s">And</a> he makes a notation that the council was in support of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1634.7s">What</a> the council was in support of was that on May 20th, when we had that meeting, we had agreed to the three vendors that came in, one would be selected, which was Republic from Tennessee. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1645.264s">But</a> we agreed to that somebody would come back after he had negotiations and we would discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1651.107s">And</a> we did on September 10th. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1652.988s">But</a> when the pushback came back, the mayor decided not to go forward at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1657.709s">And</a> speaking to Mr. Skelton, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1659.443s">are</a> referring to Mr. Skelton's comments from Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1662.726s">From</a> the 10th to the 25th of September, there was absolutely no communication between the mayor and Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1669.411s">So</a> something had to take place from the 24th to today, the 7th. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1673.915s">And</a> taking that into consideration, it's quite obvious that the chamber's concerns, oh, I don't know who wrote the letter because we don't have a copy of the letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1681.081s">He</a> says he got a letter from the chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1682.963s">But</a> when you have four separate squares, including Medford Square, which makes five, and their issues are all unique, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1688.854s">and</a> they needed to be heard, and they weren't heard, and the mayor decides to have one size fits all, I don't think that's what you call a happy resolution, especially to the business people and to the taxpayers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1700.818s">You</a> know, the fact of the matter is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1705.679s">We're</a> getting rid of people who don't live in the community, who were parking at spots all day long, and they haven't been tagged. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1713.322s">And</a> this has been going on for the entire years of the administration of this city, this mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1718.666s">And</a> now what we're going to be doing is tagging, if not towing, and telling our own taxpayers in this community, you people are going to have to start paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1728.072s">Now,</a> right up front, no free parking unless you are lucky enough to get one of those two spots in any one of the four or five sections of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1737.278s">Where</a> it's going, I don't know, Mr. President, but all I can tell you is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1741.381s">If</a> I had to put my money on something, I would put it on public safety, the police department, the personnel that's needed to keep this community safe, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1749.039s">And</a> more importantly, the subject matters that I brought up under the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1752.92s">Those</a> to me are pressing needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1755.661s">They</a> have no comparison, no comparison at all to a parking paid to park program or enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1763.163s">If</a> the mayor was so concerned about that paid to park program and enforcement, he should have done it years ago, but he didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1768.884s">And</a> when they knew that people from Winchester and other communities were coming here and parking all day and not getting tagged and ticketed, he should have done something, but he didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1777.607s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1778.148s">put</a> $300,000 this first year out of the box, compare everything to what the police department needs to keep our community safe and protected. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1786.535s">It's</a> pale in comparison. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1788.436s">And</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I just wanted to say that, um, I just think, you know, this council is either going to be committed to public safety and a new PlayStation and the police department, or this is nothing more than hot air every Tuesday night when we come here to talk about public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1804.54s">We</a> have more than enough examples. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1806.622s">And</a> I think we have more than enough good police officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1810.865s">The</a> shooting is just a drop in the bucket compared to all the drug problems that are existing throughout this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1816.609s">And</a> that's a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1818.07s">And</a> if they had more personnel, and if they could go to court, and if they had more of the mechanisms and the technology that is needed, it would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1828.597s">You</a> know, when you talk to someone, you say, hey, you're building a brand new public works department, $14 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1835.258s">$14</a> million. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1835.858s">Still</a> don't even have enough men to man it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1839.159s">But</a> you have a police department that's ready to fall apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1841.539s">You</a> have an evidence room that's completely out of control and a whole host of other issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1847.641s">So,</a> I would say, Mr. President and my fellow colleagues, that I think it's time that we take the stand and we tell the mayor we want a new police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1856.362s">I</a> don't care how you fund it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1857.863s">You</a> found the money for a public works department, then find the money for a police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1861.883s">Because</a> you're not going to make one seem to be more important than another. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1865.046s">And</a> at the same time, you're not going to put the lives of this community and the folks in this community at risk.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2711.653s">Mr.</a> President, um, I guess I missed this when I was reading it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2715.895s">If</a> you read the bottom of the mass comment, it says the chamber also acknowledged that there were several beneficial respects to the plan, such as user friendly kiosks, whatever that means. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2727.499s">After</a> deliberating and discussing concerns raised by the business community, the mayor is recommending the following changes to the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2735.962s">He's</a> recommending, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2738.8s">This</a> isn't a finality. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2741.641s">If</a> you go to point number three, it says recommend $250,000 of the revenue generated on an annual basis to be dedicated to the business district improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2751.584s">It's</a> a recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2752.965s">This</a> isn't a done deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2754.225s">And</a> if you have $250,000, what district gets it first? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2757.506s">North</a> Medford, South Medford, Boston Ave, Medford Square? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2761.447s">Where's</a> the determination there? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2762.968s">And</a> then the last one, retain business and commuter permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2765.609s">What</a> does that mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2767.446s">All</a> subjective commentary. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2770.148s">I</a> don't even know if this is really the done deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2773.031s">All</a> he's doing, he's saying he signed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2775.292s">And</a> I'm wondering if these are still things to be negotiated. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2779.536s">He's</a> recommending. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2781.057s">These</a> are recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2783.759s">They</a> may be just sticking to the original part of the plan and getting back to what Councilor Marks alluded to. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2789.324s">Not</a> only is it going to be aggressive enforcement, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2793.302s">But</a> why would you start at 7 o'clock in the morning? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2796.083s">Boston,</a> which is much bigger than Medford, starts at 8. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2800.203s">Brookline,</a> when they had their kiosks, they had to take them away because they were hurting the businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2806.344s">And</a> then if they're even recognizing by putting meters, single meters, in certain parts, well, maybe they should think about just putting meters, period, and see how that goes, and have local people do the enforcement part. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2820.094s">But</a> the more I keep reading this thing, words stand off a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2823.136s">It's</a> the terminology that's used. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2824.917s">He's</a> recommending. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2826.037s">So</a> I don't even know if this is a done deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2827.758s">None</a> of us know. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2830.48s">It's</a> two 30-minute free parking spaces in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2835.243s">Well,</a> who's in West Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2836.063s">Who's</a> it going to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2836.763s">Has</a> that been determined yet? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2837.684s">They're</a> going to flip a coin? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2840.085s">Go</a> to Boston Avenue, you're going to flip a coin? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2842.587s">The</a> whole length of that street, two free parking spaces? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2846.049s">And</a> then four paid single-space meter spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2850.427s">in</a> each of the above listed districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2853.969s">Who's</a> going to get those four? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2855.791s">And</a> as I said before, what businesses are going to be excluded rather than included? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2861.995s">You</a> know, the law is very specific on this, and I said it to you last week, and I'll say it to you again, and I said it to our chief procurement officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2869.72s">The</a> responsibility of bringing the contract forward was from the chief procurement officer, not from the mayor, and not from the budget director. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2878.205s">That's</a> what the law says. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2879.71s">And</a> there needed to be a recommendation in writing with a comparison of doing it in-house as compared to doing it out-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2887.393s">And</a> in this situation, we never got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2889.733s">We</a> never got the recommendation and how that recommendation was determined so as for the council to make a legitimate vote to go forward to accept it or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2900.137s">So</a> there's a whole host of issues that surround not only the mayor signing this or even getting to the point to having him sign it, but the fact that he lied <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2909.696s">He</a> lied to we, the people, by not coming and having the public forum for which seven members of this council voted on, to at least have a public forum, to at least have the business community, and at least have the taxpayers, the residents of the community, to come and speak up about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2924.399s">I</a> think we're all getting our emails, and people are just, once again, hearing about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2928.44s">Some</a> of them, not that they're for it, not some of them against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2931.4s">They</a> want to know more about it and how it's going to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2934.021s">But</a> apparently, the mayor doesn't want us to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2936.707s">It's</a> quite obvious. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2937.508s">He</a> certainly doesn't want the taxpayers and the residents to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2940.449s">And</a> however he chose what businesses that he met with, who knows what businesses they were that convinced him to go forward with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2947.554s">It's</a> a damn shame, because I don't think this serves in the best interest of our community.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3388.617s">I</a> have four questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3390.378s">First</a> of all, you said that they took your quote out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3394.301s">So</a> I'm going to read this quote. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3395.322s">You</a> tell me if it's accurate or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3397.363s">We're</a> going to let McGlynn quote, no, it's obvious to us that the different business districts have different needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3402.687s">White</a> said, we're not going to advocate for any specific district. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3406.39s">We're</a> going to provide opportunities through us to get those voices heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3409.752s">True</a> or false?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3414.736s">So</a> if that's true, and you're recognizing the different needs of the different areas, how can you go along and have one size fits all for all four districts?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3437.19s">Go</a> ahead.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3454.084s">That's</a> that part there. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3456.446s">You</a> said the chamber supports this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3457.887s">How</a> many members in the chamber?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3480.727s">So</a> you have votes from the 200 plus members? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3484.168s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3484.868s">So</a> how does the chamber make a decision? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3487.065s">If</a> you have membership.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3489.427s">So</a> your board of directors made this vote, not the membership.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3503.515s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3504.196s">Let's</a> get this straight.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3528.291s">You</a> just made a comment at a minute ago that some of the people that are at that meeting on the 10th aren't members of the chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3533.053s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3534.153s">So</a> because someone is not a member of the chamber, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3537.096s">They're</a> not going to be looked upon with the same favor that somebody might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3540.218s">They're</a> a business person in this community.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3548.804s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3549.304s">You</a> represent your members. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3550.625s">And</a> you also said that the business community was aware of that meeting on the 20th.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3554.828s">I</a> mean on the 10th. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3555.829s">Excuse</a> me. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3556.289s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3556.71s">At</a> 117 in the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3558.131s">That's</a> when the emails went out. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3560.632s">117</a> of the day of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3562.814s">And</a> a lot of people didn't even get it because they were still at work and not knowing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3566.209s">So</a> that's not a well-advanced notice of people — of a public meeting regarding their living. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3571.051s">The</a> President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3575.694s">Mr.</a> Kudlow.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3580.957s">Mr.</a> Kudlow. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3581.957s">Also,</a> Mr. President, I do want to get back to this thing that if Mr. White feels, on behalf of his membership, that this one-size-fits-all is going to address the concerns <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3594.167s">of</a> the five separate, the four squares and the downtown method. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3597.949s">I'd</a> like to have you explain that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3599.37s">How</a> can this one size fits all?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3671.357s">So</a> then your quote in the paper was wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3673.779s">You</a> did not indicate that each part of the city is unique.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3695.036s">Mr.</a> President, I think we need to get a report back that are these four points recommendations, or are they actually part of the contract? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3704.162s">Because</a> it's the mayor who uses the term, he's recommending changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3708.43s">It</a> doesn't say it's not definitive, it's recommending. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3712.334s">And</a> with that being said, with recommendations, I don't know if it's a contract or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3717.758s">I</a> don't know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4073.869s">Clerk,</a> do you have enough poll workers?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4095.344s">During</a> the last election, there was some concern over some of the ballot boxes not working. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4099.147s">Is</a> there any of these?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4102.988s">But</a> aren't these all checked out before? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4105.169s">Oh</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4105.409s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4136.121s">Those</a> all rechecked each and every election? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4138.782s">How</a> does this work?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4152.212s">And</a> for the sake of a public announcement, Mr. President, when can people start getting an absentee ballot?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4246.071s">Mr.</a> President, Dorothy, as we all know, is our wonderful assistant in the clerk's office with Mr. Finn, and she works very hard through the years, and she's now being able to enjoy her grandchild, her son's first child, which would be her grandchild, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4260.587s">And</a> we want to wish her the best.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4665.085s">The</a> only problem with the dog park has been the mayor is telling everyone it's going to cost $200,000 and he's telling people to go out and do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4672.391s">You</a> know, I mean, how do you turn around and tell the people you go out and get the dog park? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4676.935s">And</a> as Councilor Marks alluded to before, you know, RF Whiting Company, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4680.72s">according</a> to the mayor, was supposed to give the money for the dog park, and they never did. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4684.162s">And</a> now he's telling the people, you've got to raise the $200,000 if you really want this dog park. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4689.904s">He</a> knows how to raise money for everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4693.426s">It's</a> amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4695.047s">And</a> I think the good part is maybe, Mr. Clerk, if we have just a single number they can call the clerk's office, and maybe you should have a stack of petitions there if people come in, because that's where the licenses are as well, too, to pick up a license in your office. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4710.845s">I</a> can't generate the petitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4712.306s">No,</a> no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4713.427s">If</a> petitions are left in your office, if petitions are left in your office and somebody wants to come and pick them up, they can pick them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4719.731s">I</a> think that may be a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4723.553s">Central</a> point in the building.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4807.91s">President,</a> yesterday, well, I think it was yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4812.873s">I</a> got mine yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4813.733s">Other</a> people may have got it the day before. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4815.754s">We</a> all received in the mail our new water bill, and we also received a letter from the city indicating to the city of Medford water and sewer customers. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4826.601s">Now,</a> the letter is undated, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4829.036s">right</a> there in and of itself tends to indicate a lack of professionalism in the letter going out. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4837.779s">There</a> was no notice of a public meeting or an agenda item on this particular matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4843.801s">The</a> Medford City Council not only has talked about it, but at our April meeting of this year, we had a resolution that was offered by myself and passed by the seven members of the council to have the cemetery, no, excuse me, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4858.663s">The</a> Water and Soil Commission has appeared before the council and to explain this new idea of tiered rates and commercial rates or whatever it might be and however it's going to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4869.312s">And</a> that passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4870.793s">Unfortunately,</a> the mayor sends an answer back and says it's the council's purview. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4876.618s">I</a> mean, it's the Water and Soil Commission's purview to make that decision, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4881.141s">And</a> number two, this is a matter that involves the entire city for the purposes of being involved and getting involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4889.346s">The</a> council has asked on numerous occasions for the Water and Soil Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4893.609s">I</a> personally have met with the chairman of the Water and Soil Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4897.272s">I</a> asked him to come here. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4898.353s">We're</a> still waiting for him to come here. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4901.376s">The</a> mayor has never offered a public meeting or a hearing on this particular increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4907.22s">So</a> there is a complete lack of public education on this increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4911.664s">And</a> as a result of this, we have problems here. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4916.408s">Look</a> at your bill that just came out, and it talks about <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4920.526s">The</a> rates only apply to homes with up to four families and residential condo buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4926.05s">And</a> then it gives you a 0 to 800 as a base. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4929.493s">And</a> I don't know where they got that 800 as being the base. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4932.215s">Again,</a> no determination from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4934.196s">And</a> then from 800 cubic feet to 1,600 feet, you get to another rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4938.62s">And</a> it goes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4939.54s">And</a> after that, there's a third rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4941.222s">So</a> as a residential owner, you could have up to three types of rates in your particular house. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4946.646s">And</a> then it goes down further to indicate <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4949.122s">Every</a> other person or every other type of an account will be charged 0.138. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4954.786s">Now,</a> does that mean that that's going to be a commercial rate? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4960.309s">I</a> thought we were led to believe that there was going to be allegedly a commercial rate, which would be different than the regular rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4967.853s">But</a> if you go back to the first paragraph, they talk about they're adopting this in response to Chapter 165, Section 2B. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4972.836s">And</a> 165, Section 2B is very explicit <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4979.343s">where</a> it talks about, shall institute water charges and fees that incorporate a base rate for all, provided, which means other than or maybe, that said base rate shall be increased at an increased block rate to fairly reflect the resource demand and consumption of high volume uses of water. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5002.576s">Now</a> think about high volume uses of water. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5007.475s">If</a> you live in a three-family house, for the example that they use, you are a single person on the first floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5014.861s">There</a> is two, three people on the third floor, five or six people on the third floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5019.425s">And</a> they use the example you used, 2,100 units of water. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5023.068s">Well,</a> they're going to take the 2,100 units of water, divide it by three, and everybody's going to be tagged with 700 units of water to be charged. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5031.936s">That</a> doesn't make any sense at all, number one, because number one, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5036.306s">Not</a> everybody has a meter in their apartment. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5038.346s">And</a> if it's a single meter that's going to cover the whole house, some houses are like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5043.948s">I</a> mean, how do you distribute that? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5046.508s">I</a> mean, where they come up with this, I have absolutely no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5050.969s">And</a> this is what prompted probably eight or nine of my 13 calls that I've already received so far in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5056.65s">How</a> do they make this type of a determination? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5058.751s">But</a> more importantly, personally, I think this is the mayor's way of retaliating against the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5064.619s">because</a> we didn't give him his $600,000 in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5067.981s">Bad</a> enough we didn't give him his parking garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5070.103s">And</a> as a result of that, this rate increase not only will pick up the $600,000, it'll probably exceed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5077.168s">Absolutely,</a> absolutely not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5080.15s">It</a> is not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5081.751s">At</a> the present time, people should be aware of the fact, at the present time, in our water and sewer retained earnings account, we have $8,400,000 as of today. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5096.533s">$8,400,000.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5098.275s">We</a> would have $9,600,000 if we didn't take a million two a few years ago to take the mayor out of his deficit hole because he couldn't balance the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5107.762s">But</a> with that being said, $8 million, that's a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5113.366s">And</a> we're talking about rate payers having to be charged right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5117.549s">There</a> is nothing in this letter that would even give you an assumption <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5122.301s">that</a> it's going to take place next year, or the next billing cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5125.963s">They</a> just jam it in the letter, and there it is in your new bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5131.046s">Now,</a> I went back, and to my knowledge, the last time in billing cycles in 2006, as compared to the bills that we have right now, the 2006 bill, sixth bill, tells you <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5144.895s">The</a> cost, it breaks it down for water and sewer, the cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5149.277s">Your</a> water and sewer cost is not broken down in these blue bills that we've been getting for a long period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5155.381s">And</a> as a result of that, I'm going to suggest in part, Mr. President, that the city's water and sewer department and the city of Medford building department reinstitute the prior building process that not only showed the prior readings, the present readings, the usage, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5173.311s">but</a> the rates for water and the rates for sewer per 100 cubic feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5177.955s">So</a> the people have an informed, knowledgeable bill, rather than getting a dollar amount and trying to figure out the hocus pocus that's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5187.281s">Baseline</a> water usage of 800, where do they get that? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5190.484s">I</a> have absolutely no idea who determined, and they don't even tell you where it came from. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5197.089s">The</a> bill, as I said before, it doesn't ID the water and sewer rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5200.435s">But</a> back and prior to 2006, it did. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5202.977s">It</a> gives you everything that you would want to know to try to figure out your bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5208.221s">Now,</a> your old rate consumption as compared to your new rate consumption, that's another thing that's not on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5214.767s">Because</a> all they're doing and they're telling you on the blue bill, it's just telling you what you had last time, what the reading was, and the amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5226.276s">And</a> once again, what's water, what's sewer, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5232.566s">I</a> think what really needs to be done on this particular issue is two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5237.55s">You</a> can't send out bills to people and just tell them it becomes effective now. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5243.555s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5244.315s">Number</a> two, you don't send out a letter that's undated. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5247.197s">Number</a> three, you don't turn around and tell, for an example, a three-family house, you're going to split it between the three floors, and everyone's going to pay the same amount on a per-unit charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5256.965s">You</a> don't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5258.806s">Second</a> of all, there's nothing on this bill <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5261.719s">on</a> this letter that talks about a commercial rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5266.141s">And</a> I think Councilor Marks, is he here? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5268.382s">I</a> think there was an issue relative to a commercial rate before. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5271.543s">You</a> know, where are we going with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5273.664s">It</a> says all other rates will be 0.1381. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5275.925s">And</a> that will be the same rate as someone who goes from the 800 to the 1600 level in a residential home. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5285.829s">I</a> said it before and I'll say it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5287.97s">If</a> families are going to be penalized because they have <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5291.272s">children</a> or mothers and fathers or seniors living with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5295.695s">That's</a> not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5297.036s">It's</a> absolutely not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5298.497s">And</a> as the law says, the resources should go on the demand and the consumption of high volume uses of water. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5307.063s">A</a> residential home, maybe just over this 800 level or whatever it might be, those aren't high uses of water. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5314.828s">That's</a> baseline wherever they got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5317.089s">Maybe</a> the zero to 800. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5318.769s">should</a> be maybe the $0 to $1,200 or $1,400, and then change it after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5323.911s">Because</a> I don't think it's bad enough rate payers, you're hitting them with a federal tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5327.672s">You</a> hit them with your state tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5329.013s">You</a> hit them with a meals tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5330.033s">You're</a> hitting them with a gas tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5331.614s">You</a> hit them with your real estate tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5333.494s">And</a> now you want to raise their water and sewer tax with an $8.4 million surplus sitting in a kitty. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5341.717s">It's</a> wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5343.358s">This</a> is not what the council asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5345.318s">I</a> believe this is the mayor's <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5347.443s">way</a> of getting back at the council because $600,000 was taken out of the budget for which the council voted for to knock off the 10% rate increase? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5357.691s">Well,</a> this rate increase is definitely going to exceed the 10% that the mayor was losing, or the $600,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5364.436s">And</a> who's going to pay for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5366.638s">It's</a> the everyday person. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5368.779s">I</a> would strongly suggest, Mr. President, once again, as we did in August, if the mayor says this is within the purview of the council, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5376.84s">Then</a> let it be in the purview and strike that respectfully request that the Board of Commissioners appear before the Medford City Council for the purposes of explaining not only the letter, but the rates as to where we're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5389.863s">And</a> also respectfully request that they change their billing process to accurately show the rate for water, the rate for sewer, where it's going, and the amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5400.945s">Now</a> with that being said, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5403.911s">I</a> can't find anyone, and I'm still waiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5405.872s">I</a> had a long talk today with Mr. Remsburg, who was the chief legal counsel for the MWRA. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5411.994s">And</a> in my conversation with him, which represented the same type of conversation I had with him in August of this past year, we're back to the same issue for which I believe we're on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5422.577s">The</a> bigger users, the demand for bigger users and demand for more consumption and high volume of users of water should be the first ones, according to this chapter of the law, to be paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5433.882s">It</a> says, all municipalities and water districts within the jurisdiction of the MWRA, but not including community service by the Connecticut Valley Aqueduct, shall institute water charges and fees that incorporate a base rate for all users. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5450.174s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5450.854s">They're</a> saying 800 is the base rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5453.176s">But</a> it says, provided that said base rate shall be increased at an increasing block rate to fairly recollect <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5461.909s">the</a> resources, demand, and consumption of high-volume uses of water. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5467.072s">If</a> somebody is 801, is they going to be tagged as a high-volume use of water? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5472.074s">Because</a> that person at 801, which could be residential, is going to be tagged at the same amount that everyone else is going to be tagged that's not residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5482.059s">And</a> you're going to have to assume it's commercial, because they don't say it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5484.741s">But</a> what is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5487.082s">Everybody</a> else but residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5488.703s">It's</a> got to be commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5490.463s">So</a> with that being said, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5492.191s">I</a> think this needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5494.312s">I</a> think somebody needs to be here to address it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5496.474s">I</a> think the billing needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5498.215s">And</a> more importantly, I think it's absolutely unfair that somebody would put a, an increase in your bill on the same time that goes out with no public education, no public notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5511.223s">You</a> know, this is three strikes that the mayor has given to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5515.926s">He's</a> taking money away from people on cable access on Verizon and Comcast bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5521.547s">He's</a> sitting on $303,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5522.448s">It's</a> sitting downstairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5525.489s">He</a> just now signs, he just now signs a pay to park program that didn't have one public hearing here for the taxpayers to talk about and discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5534.955s">And</a> thirdly, he's now hitting you with a new tax on your water and sewer charge with no public input, no public information, no public hearing or anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5545.34s">That's</a> three strikes since the summer of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5549.028s">How</a> much more is it that the people of this community want to take? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5552.35s">When</a> are you going to realize that your open government is not open like you think it is? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5557.532s">And</a> your notorious government is as notorious as it can be, because there's no transparency as to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5565.216s">This</a> letter should have been ID'd with a date, and it should have addressed itself DMF resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5572.16s">In</a> the near future, giving it the date, your bill will be going up the following, and it'll give the reason why. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5578.325s">But</a> the insanity of saying that a three-family or a two-family or a four-family house is going to be divided by the amount of units, and that's what they're going to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5587.372s">They</a> have no right saying that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5588.413s">They</a> have no right doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5589.874s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I'm moving that our Board of Water and Soil Commissioners appear before the Medford City Council to discuss this particular matter.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5743.391s">I</a> hear what Councilor Knight is talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5746.032s">My</a> point of clarification is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5747.513s">While</a> he may be running off a string of resolutions, we had asked for a public hearing and a public meeting on this and for whatever <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5755.629s">the</a> Water and Soil Commissioners might have done or made the determination. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5759.652s">The</a> council has been asked to be apprised, and they've been asked to appear before here, and they never have. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5765.217s">So</a> 800 getting to the baseline, how did you get to it? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5769.16s">Where</a> did you come up with that number? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5770.961s">Because</a> if you look at a lot of the residential homes, they're going to be between 800 and that 1,600 mark. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5776.326s">So</a> by going over by one cubic feet, you're going to be putting that residential homeowner, who might have two or three kids or taking care of a senior citizen, paying a higher rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5786.059s">And</a> that's where I think the discussion needs to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5789.82s">I'm</a> not denying the fact that the more you use, the more you should pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5794.121s">But</a> this is a big gap from $800 to $800 to $1,600. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5798.603s">And</a> if you are just a little bit over that, you're going to be saddled with that additional thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5802.984s">And</a> again, as I said, if somebody has multiple people living in their family home, they're going to be penalized for using the water. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5809.005s">If</a> they use a dramatic amount, that's one thing.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5926.949s">Yeah,</a> clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5927.669s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5928.549s">I</a> hear what Councilor Knight is alluding to. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5930.53s">The</a> point is valid. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5932.711s">It</a> went from zero to 1,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5934.131s">Why</a> did it come down to 800? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5935.812s">Now,</a> if you speak to some of the members, they're going to turn around and tell you, this is part of the conservation mode of saving water and within families and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5944.434s">Which</a> I wholeheartedly support. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5945.875s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5946.315s">But</a> I don't think anybody's going to deny the fact that, you know, you don't want to penalize people because they have people living in their homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5952.81s">who</a> might be seniors or elderly or babies or two or three children or for whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5958.957s">And</a> I would be not in favor of having a subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5963.002s">I</a> would be in favor of just having, calling for the public hearing and have them come in and explain it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5967.007s">They've</a> already mean what they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5969.149s">And</a> one point further, and I think as a Councilor, Councilor Marks, I think we had this conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5974.636s">Getting</a> to the point of the households, as Councilor Knight has just alluded to, how did you make this determination? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5981.902s">Where</a> are the numbers of those homes that are between 0 to 800, and from 800 to 1,600, and over that? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5989.069s">They</a> have to have statistics to do that, because if they just decided to go to 800 because it sounded good, because it was a good conservation move, well, that's not good. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5998.536s">If</a> there's people between 800 and 850, whatever it might be, there's nothing wrong with going to 1,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6002.859s">I</a> mean, that's a compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6004.199s">I</a> got no problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6005.56s">But</a> I want to see these numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6007.781s">I</a> want to see these numbers.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6033.314s">Thank</a> you for your point. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6034.315s">I</a> just remind councilor Dello Russo, one thing we had asked at one point in time, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6039.093s">to</a> have our city engineer appear before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6041.393s">And</a> she didn't come because the mayor told her not to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6043.934s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6044.474s">So</a> we can ask the Water and Soil Commissioners to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6047.995s">But</a> if they choose not to come because they're told not to come, where does that put the council?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6534.51s">Point</a> of clarification, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6536.29s">The</a> law says explicitly if the estimated income is more than the total appropriations, the excess shall be appropriated to a separate reserve fund and used for capital expenditures of the enterprise subject to the appropriation or to reduce user charges if authorized by the appropriate entity. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6554.602s">responsible</a> for operations of the enterprise.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6559.265s">He</a> can the law.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6561.047s">Absolutely.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6705.164s">Mr.</a> President, also the letter indicates further down that they're going to keep this baseline rate for the first year. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6711.988s">So</a> the intention is that they're going to be going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6714.749s">So</a> with that being said, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6716.6s">I'm</a> going to make the request that the Board of Water and Soil Commissioners appear before the Medford City Council to discuss this letter that went out that's unsigned, undated, as it represents, and that a new bill be forthcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6735.186s">They</a> revised the bill that includes the rate for the water and the rate for the sewage. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6742.961s">and</a> along with the total amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6744.823s">Also,</a> the letter negates to put in here that it's nothing more than the new use. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6749.746s">They</a> don't have the old use by consumption and water and sewer charges. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6754.25s">And</a> I think that would be, once again, pure transparency for the rate payers at least to see what's going on other than, once again, just getting a letter saying, you know, this is what you're going to have to pay and your rates are going up and, you know, with no clarification, absolutely no education. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6769.241s">There</a> was absolutely nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6770.863s">You</a> notice that the mayor did not. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6772.885s">Listen,</a> the Board of Soil Commissioners worked for the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6775.266s">They're</a> his appointments on that board. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6777.208s">The</a> mayor owns this one as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6778.609s">This</a> is his responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6780.27s">If</a> he knew the rates were going up, for which they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6783.332s">And</a> if this is his end run to circumvent this council, because this council wouldn't give him his parking garage and wouldn't give him his $600,000 in the budget for 10% water rate increase, this is certainly the wrong way to go, especially with $8.4 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6799.722s">sitting</a> in the surplus account. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6801.564s">That</a> is just so wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6803.926s">You</a> know, you're ripping off the taxpayers once again, Mr. Mayor, knowing that their money is just sitting in an account to make you look good at a bond rating at the expense of the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6816.956s">Maybe</a> they'd like to enjoy some of that money and spend it on their family or their kids or what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6822.481s">So</a> with that being said, I move the question, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6870.323s">I</a> can go either way because it's obvious that this has already been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6873.446s">From</a> the documents that I have secured from the Water and Sewer Commission, they've been talking about this since April of this past year with the city engineer and Mr. Woodcock, the MWRA, the legal counsel, and what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6884.707s">So</a> their determination has already been made. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6886.628s">My</a> question is going to be very simple and germane, basically what we had here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6890.209s">I</a> mean, the one thing, you know, they're saying that they cannot make the recommendation to reduce the water and sewer rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6899.713s">Well,</a> if they can't make the recommendation to reduce it, how can they make the recommendation to increase it? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6904.535s">It</a> doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6905.816s">The</a> law doesn't prohibit them from doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6907.916s">And</a> with an $8.4 million surplus, in the best interest of this community, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6912.062s">It</a> would have been a wonderful exposure by the Water and Soil Commission to recommend to the mayor that we not increase and we take this out of the Water and Soil account. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6920.269s">But</a> as we all know, this is the mayor's board, and they're going to do whatever the mayor tells them to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6924.793s">So</a> I can go either way on the resolution.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6994.682s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6995.722s">On</a> the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6996.202s">I</a> got no problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6999.349s">We</a> only have three more meetings between now and we're off for two. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7002.271s">So</a> I would request that this meeting take place within the next two to three week, next two to three meetings that were available. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7008.496s">But</a> in the meantime, if we could have some information forwarded to us so we could at least know the proposed that they're giving us here, how they got to this baseline of 800, if we could get some information on how they got to that, if we get some information ahead of time, once again, what's the old rate compared to the new rates? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7029.825s">And</a> something as it relates to, you know, revising the bill that includes the water rates for water and sewer usage and the dollar amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7039.671s">So</a> at least when somebody gets it, they could figure it out rather than just getting numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7044.033s">Then</a> the conversation on that particular night would just basically, you know, figure out the tiered rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7051.158s">This</a> lacks the word commercial rate in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7054.219s">It</a> says all other, all other establishments. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7059.485s">which</a> I'm assuming is going to be commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7062.327s">We'll</a> find that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7063.709s">So</a> if we could have that and a roll call vote.<h2><a href="../2013-06-05_LlmLze0ItRE/2013-06-05_LlmLze0ItRE.html">May 28, 2013 City Council of Medford, Massachusetts Full upload of complete council meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=114.915s">On</a> that motion, Councilor Dello Russo's amendment, we just got a notice I think today relative to a meeting that's going to take place on June 3rd by the folks that are doing the work over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=125.444s">So</a> that may be something you may want to bring up for the purpose of letting them pay to do the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=132.649s">So</a> it's in your, pardon me? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=134.09s">You</a> want to amend that further? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=134.891s">Yeah,</a> amend it further, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=137.383s">Why</a> don't you repeat that again? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=138.705s">The</a> amendment is that the Department of Transportation is having a public meeting on June 3rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=142.97s">I</a> believe it's in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=144.432s">We</a> got a notice today in our emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=146.474s">There's</a> one of six locations, that's the next one coming up, and that will make reference to Councilor Camuso's and Councilor De La Rosa's thoughts relative to Medford Street.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=869.451s">On</a> that motion, could we get a copy of where the <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=875.071s">Dog</a> packs and the amount of money was supposed to be coming from October of 2011. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=879.395s">The</a> mayor made a public announcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=883.058s">We've</a> been talking about dog packs since 2011, because that was supposed to have been part of the mitigation that F.W. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=889.884s">White,</a> or J.F. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=890.605s">White,</a> was supposed to be giving the city of Medford for the FAST-14. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=893.847s">So</a> we've never seen the dog pack. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=896.169s">Could</a> we just get the handle on what that mitigation terminology was on dog packs? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=901.957s">$50,000.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=902.077s">I</a> have no idea.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1230.836s">Mr.</a> President last Tuesday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1232.357s">Um,</a> I thought we had a very informative conversation and after I went back and I reviewed the tape, um, I, I, I think to some degree we will mislead or at least I was misled because I asked the question as a related is the new location on Salem street going to have the capacity <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1249.502s">to</a> do a broadcast from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1251.983s">And</a> the answer was yes from the manager of the station. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1257.945s">Now,</a> subsequent to that, immediately following the meeting, the transmission of the module, or whatever you want to call the terminology, was in the corner of the room over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1267.888s">And</a> the conversation finally alluded to the fact that on Riverside Avenue, there is absolutely no Comcast, and there is no Verizon capacity to do broadcasting or to bring cable in. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1279.687s">Now,</a> if you remember correctly, Mr. President, it was you who brought up this issue, I think some five to seven years ago, relative to a business client on High Street who was trying to get Comcast, I think, or Verizon, into the building over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1295.113s">It</a> was Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1296.774s">And</a> at that point in time, I believe there was, in our conversation, I believe we had someone from Channel 3, and I don't know who, so I don't want to mention any names. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1308.291s">because</a> I'd be absolutely wrong, but I remember somebody from Channel 3 indicating that that was one of the problems that we had in Medford Square, the inability or the lack of capacity to have broadcasting in the downtown Medford Square area, which seems to be pretty kind of evident. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1320.658s">Now,</a> again, from the conversation that took place last Tuesday night and from the information that was ascertained, there is a two-year contract signed, I believe, at 32 Salem Street, Riverside Avenue, excuse me, <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1333.507s">There's</a> no Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1334.348s">There's</a> no Verizon there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1336.109s">So</a> how do you broadcast out of have a full-fledged studio if you don't have that capacity to broadcast from there? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1343.775s">So</a> what's going on now, if I understand all of this correctly, is the modular transmission, lack of terminology. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1350.441s">I</a> don't know the proper terminology. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1352.362s">But</a> it's here in this particular building, or it was brought here in this particular building. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1357.406s">I</a> don't know if it's still here. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1358.902s">And</a> the whole idea is that the transmission would come from Verizon or Comcast to City Hall, and then they would somehow bounce it to 32 Riverside Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1369.727s">And</a> I'm saying to myself, well, wait a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1371.308s">What</a> is this all about? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1373.629s">This</a> is not having a full-fledged studio that's equipped on its own merits at its own location. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1379.251s">Then</a> I started to think about this thing even more. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1380.952s">And</a> I'm saying to myself, we have a concern here. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1384.054s">We're</a> putting channel-free equipment into Medford City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1387.915s">And</a> by putting Channel 3 equipment into Medford City Hall, are we talking about having a liability issue here? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1393.379s">Are</a> we talking about the equipment here in City Hall? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1395.881s">Are</a> we talking about the access to City Hall? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1398.062s">The</a> keys and who would have keys to City Hall? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1400.184s">Who</a> would be coming into City Hall if, in fact, something were to go wrong in the transmission from City Hall to 32 Riverside Avenue? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1408.009s">And</a> there's a whole host of questions here. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1409.471s">And</a> the city has a liability policy as it relates to being a self-insured. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1413.433s">Now,</a> we all know that Channel 3 is a separate private nonprofit corporation. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1417.611s">So,</a> I mean, we have two separate entities here running around. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1421.674s">We</a> were also told at that point in time that there was, I believe, less than $100,000 operating budget that they were operating in, but there is another budget for whatever that might be worth. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1434.682s">So</a> I tried to get down there on two separate occasions on Riverside Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1437.624s">Both</a> times I couldn't get in. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1438.845s">Both</a> times the door was locked, but on one particular day, <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1442.022s">The</a> paper was down, I did have a chance to look in, and it didn't look like there was hardly any work, if any work at all was taking place down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1447.724s">Now</a> this goes back to March of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1450.345s">So</a> now we have a station manager that's getting paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1452.586s">We</a> have no transmission, no broadcasting coming forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1455.628s">We</a> have, for whatever the reason might be, if in fact the city of Medford is now being a part of whatever Channel 3 is going to be involved with, if the mayor is doing this, I have no idea why Channel 3 would even be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1467.031s">and</a> entertaining City Hall, but more importantly, why would they even want to stay on Riverside Avenue with no access to cable television, Verizon or Comcast? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1477.038s">You</a> know, poor choice, they've been around, they know the situation, they know what Medford Square is about, they know what Riverside Ave is all about, and that was a poor choice to go there, especially being in the business for, they're not novice, these people that are working there, and they're a part of Channel 3, they've been around for a while, they know what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1495.424s">And</a> since they know what's going on, the sad part about this is they've got themselves locked into a contract for which I would assume, I would hope that they would be able to get out of. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1503.169s">And</a> even if they had to get sued, who cares about getting sued? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1506.211s">Look</a> at the time that you're costing the city, the taxpayers, each of the rate payers, each and every cable bill are paying for something. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1512.096s">You're</a> paying for station manager that has no job to do because there's nothing being programmed. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1516.038s">There's</a> nothing being taped. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1517.878s">And</a> then it dawned on me yesterday while we were at the cemetery and we were listening to the speeches being made and watching the people that were there and the observance, where is all this portable equipment? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1528.108s">The</a> portable equipment that Channel 3 has had through the years from the thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars that subscribers have not only paid, but the city of Medford has transferred over to Channel 3 through the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1541.872s">They</a> could have had people out there with portable cameras doing the portable televising of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1546.456s">And</a> then, if in fact, and when they do come back on, that they would have a whole host of things to put on, the Memorial Day service, graduations, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1555.763s">You</a> don't see any of that around. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1557.825s">And</a> then we were told there's 10 board of directors. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1559.627s">I</a> have no idea who the board of directors are, and I would hope they would come forward and let us know who these board of directors are so we could get a handle on what the makeup of the board is. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1569.206s">And</a> then, I believe one of the situations that came up, going back and reviewing Judge Jackson's report, that the city paid over $15,000 on, Melanson and Heath, the city's auditor, on one particular year, going back, I believe it was just before or after Judge Jackson, indicated there was, on a $15,000 account, $5,000 was totally unaccounted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1587.324s">No</a> receipts, no records, totally unaccounted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1593.157s">Now</a> I know I see one of the folks sitting in the audience, I don't know which one it is, but I know he came to the podium one night and he said it was a combination of sloppy bookkeeping, not keeping the records accurate, but we're going to do a better job and all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1606.01s">Well,</a> our resolution last week was to ask for an audit, a complete audit on channel three for the last three years and have that forwarded to the city because the rate payers really have no other alternative. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1617.708s">but</a> to either go to the mirror. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1618.928s">And</a> it's obvious that the mirror is either failing to do anything, doesn't want to do anything, afraid to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1624.93s">So</a> the people's voice, which is at this podium right now, is nothing more than asking, what is really going on over there? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1632.052s">You</a> know, why would you want to put a TV station for cable subscribers for public access at a location that has no accessibility to the cable? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1643.836s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1644.636s">Number</a> two, why wasn't that thought out ahead of time <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1647.216s">to</a> know that cable access could not go there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1649.578s">And</a> number three, more importantly, you know, they should go out and find another spot and think about what really cable access is here within this community and what it should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1658.265s">Because</a> the taxpayers and the rate payers, as Councilor Caraviello alluded to last Tuesday night, they're getting ripped off each and every month. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1664.65s">There</a> should be an accounting for that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1666.211s">There</a> should be a credit coming back. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1667.952s">And</a> the City of Medford should not be holding that money available for Channel 3 if they're not broadcasting. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1672.984s">People</a> are getting paid for doing no work, because there's no work to be done over there, and there's no broadcasting. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1678.367s">So,</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I think we really need to get an answer from our city solicitor as it relates to, is the city of Medford using a public building for the purposes of having transmission out of this building to 32 Riverside Avenue for the purposes of having public access cable television? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1697.556s">And</a> if that's the case, what is, if any, legal ramifications that might be involved? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1702.605s">Let's</a> go back to the other issue, Mr. Clark, who comes into the building, who's going to handle the phone calls, who's going to have a set of keys, who's going to be responsible for the equipment, who's going to be responsible for the city's equipment, who's going to be responsible for what's in this building if somebody from Channel 3 or one of their designees comes into this building for whatever the reasons might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1722.009s">That's</a> the sad part about not having this all in one place with the ability to be <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1727.66s">accessed</a> in and out of one place. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1729.661s">And</a> to come here in City Hall now, after the fact, having whatever the tenure was in 5 High Street, whatever that lawsuit might be all about, whatever the reason why they left there, it doesn't make any sense that they would go to another place that gives them less opportunity for the purposes of broadcasting on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1747.69s">On</a> motion to Councilor Penta, Vice President Del Russo.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2051.672s">While</a> you might be autonomous legally, <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2054.366s">You</a> are taking ratepayers' money for which the mayor of this community overrides your corporation, because he administers Channel 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2062.451s">He's</a> the executive director, and technically, of your Channel 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2066.413s">But</a> he's not taking any action for whatever the reason is. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2069.615s">So</a> you feel as though it's your duty to go ahead and take action? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2073.017s">It's</a> my duty to let the taxpayer, ratepayer know that that Channel 3 is not operating. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2077.64s">It</a> should be operating. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2078.941s">And</a> there is something wrong, especially when you're bringing equipment into this building <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2082.574s">and</a> trying to make the modular or the transmission go from here to there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2085.695s">Why</a> didn't you just go to another place that had access?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2095.757s">There's</a> nothing to be confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2096.838s">Don't</a> play the game tonight, Frank. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2098.018s">The</a> bottom line is you're in a place that you had no right going to because there was no access, and you've taken two months worth of ratepayers' money that they're paying each and every <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2105.993s">You're</a> paying people at work that have no job to go to.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2109.595s">No,</a> let me give you the history. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2111.036s">The</a> history is this, Frank. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2112.417s">Frank,</a> Frank, the history is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2115.719s">He</a> hasn't earned my respect, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2117.7s">Well,</a> you haven't earned mine either.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2120.801s">That's</a> on Riverside Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2121.982s">You're</a> in a place that does not have access to cable, Verizon, or Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2126.124s">You're</a> not operating, and the tax rate payers in this community are not getting their money's worth. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2130.267s">That's</a> the bottom line. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2131.567s">That's</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2132.688s">So</a> why did you go there? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2133.729s">Answer</a> that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2134.749s">Why</a> did you go to a place knowing that there was no access?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2159.226s">Well,</a> who are the board of directors? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2160.887s">He</a> said there was 10 of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2161.928s">Do</a> you know the 10 of them? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2162.849s">Who</a> said there were 10? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2164.45s">Mr.</a> Sano, your director.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2167.392s">Well,</a> that's what he said. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2168.272s">He</a> told us they were 10.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2176.316s">Let</a> me give a little history. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2177.676s">Let</a> me give a little history. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2179.197s">Mr.</a> Poleri, Mr. Poleri, Mr. Poleri, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2183.259s">Mr.</a> Poleri, how many board of directors do you have?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2189.481s">No,</a> how many do you have right now, active? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2191.803s">I</a> want to say six. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2192.844s">You</a> have six. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2193.885s">So</a> your station manager was wrong when he said 10.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2201.17s">Well,</a> that's what he said, 10.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2213.358s">No,</a> I don't want any history. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2214.619s">Mr.</a> President, we're not here. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2216.16s">That's</a> not the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2217.438s">The</a> resolution's not about a history of TV3 to dance around the subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2220.52s">The</a> subject matter is very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2222.221s">The</a> rate payers have no one to go to, because the mayor is not doing anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2225.843s">So</a> when they come to a council or a council law— Well, that's for you to discuss with the mayor, isn't it?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2232.547s">Yes,</a> it is.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2235.549s">You</a> may be autonomous in your mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2237.851s">In</a> your mind, you might be autonomous. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2239.673s">But</a> you are using ratepayers' money. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2244.817s">You're</a> taking ratepayers' money that the mayor is giving to you because of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2249.942s">But</a> you have no access. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2251.083s">There's</a> no television. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2252.123s">There's</a> no broadcasting. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2253.625s">You're</a> paying for people that don't have a job to go to for two months plus more. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2257.008s">Tell</a> me. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2261.209s">Yeah,</a> I'm really serious.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2292.695s">Point</a> of information, I wanna know why you're not broadcasting it on Riverside Avenue.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2297.979s">Answer</a> it, I don't want a long history, just tell me the reason why. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2300.34s">All</a> right, go ahead, go ahead with your statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2301.901s">What's</a> your answer?

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2379.874s">If</a> you're having issues at 5 High Street.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2401.104s">You</a> went there knowing it didn't have it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2473.079s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2475.66s">Why</a> did you bring your transmitter over here last week and have it stored here? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2478.421s">Because</a> you were going to transmit here and then from here it's going to bounce back there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2481.123s">Why'd</a> you do that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2495.953s">So</a> you cannot broadcast legitimately on your own at 32 Riverside Avenue? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2500.315s">That's</a> not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2501.795s">Forget</a> City Hall.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2505.557s">You</a> cannot do it, Frank. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2507.118s">You</a> just got through saying there's a feed here, which is going to allow you to broadcast them there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2512.14s">You</a> cannot go to 32 Riverside Avenue on its own without City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2516.002s">You</a> need City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2516.722s">That's</a> the bottom line.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2530.495s">So</a> why don't you just go someplace that had cable accessibility?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2554.466s">Councilman</a> Iacocca, so a few years ago, five, six years ago, brought up that issue, and your people were here one night when we had a discussion on how Cable Comcast was being broadcast, and as a matter of fact, it went all the way to Haines Square, and it was a business person. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2568.589s">Remember,</a> who's the person?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2572.8s">My</a> belief is Riverside Avenue going up to High Street is not wired. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2576.904s">Was</a> not wired.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2590.278s">You</a> mentioned High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2591.579s">That's</a> what I said.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2595.48s">Well,</a> you weren't specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2596.8s">You</a> said High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2597.92s">Excuse</a> me. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2598.34s">Five</a> High Streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2599.161s">Bottom</a> line is you're wasting taxpayers' money, ratepayers' money by being in a place, you're not broadcasting, there's nothing going on over there, you're paying a station manager and one other person for nothing.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2612.344s">There</a> is nothing going on for him.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2614.565s">There</a> isn't.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2629.393s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President, have you got any legal opinion from a city solicitor as it relates to the liability, if anything, and how this is all going to work? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2637.958s">Have</a> you discussed this with the city solicitor? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2639.919s">I</a> have a meeting tomorrow with the mayor and the solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2642.701s">So</a> in other words, you're going ahead, making an assumption over here by going into construction and spending money, but you haven't met with the city manager, I mean, the mayor and the solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2652.727s">So</a> you went ahead, ahead of time, two months ago, going in there, and now you just decide to go to the city solicitor.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2661.27s">Why</a> is it inaccurate? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2662.431s">You</a> just said you're meeting tomorrow.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2670.279s">So</a> the Mayor has given you his blessing to put your equipment in this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2673.543s">Is</a> that what you're saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2674.224s">That's</a> essentially correct, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2676.426s">The</a> Mayor of Medford said to you, Frank Palleri, Board of Directors at Channel 3, you can put your <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2682.645s">your</a> equipment here and broadcast from here to that studio.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2714.261s">Point</a> of further information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2717.403s">You</a> just used the word, hopefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2720.805s">Give</a> the same services, hopefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2722.886s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2723.459s">The</a> word hopefully should never have even been used. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2725.82s">It</a> should have been able to say, to provide the same services, period.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2741.247s">But</a> to get here and there, you keep saying here and there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2744.348s">City</a> Hall is supposed to be a part of this.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2749.673s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2752.556s">No,</a> I just think there's a liability issue here and I think there's an issue that the city needs to address.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2769.069s">Don't</a> tell me what I know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2771.671s">Grandstanding?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2772.331s">This</a> is you. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2772.792s">This</a> is what you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2773.532s">This</a> is what you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2775.073s">You</a> coming up here and making a big example of what? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2779.716s">The</a> bottom line. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2780.177s">So</a> let me go ahead and give a step. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2781.378s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2789.771s">Point</a> of further information, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2792.717s">You</a> keep saying you're in the process of building what? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2795.563s">You</a> don't have the ability to transmit out of there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2798.429s">What</a> are you building?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2806.338s">If</a> you can't transmit from the internet.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2815.084s">I</a> don't care about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2816.325s">I</a> care about- How do you think they transmit over- Keep your voice down, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2819.507s">I</a> care about Channel 3 and the subscribers paying for the money.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2931.302s">You</a> know, if you're going to have this ability to come into this building because your equipment is here, what do you expect the city to do if you have to come in here <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2942.455s">and</a> the building is closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2944.517s">Do</a> you expect to get keys to the city?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2987.134s">City</a> Hall closes at 12.30 on a Friday, you have Monday through Friday, so if God forbid something had happened, you'd be down all weekend, whereas if you were in a location, <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2996.087s">where</a> all your equipment was there, somebody could get in, it could be serviced within an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3000.097s">Again,</a> this does not make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3002.182s">Staying</a> in a place. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3003.706s">staying</a> in a place that does not give you access. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3006.348s">And</a> you have to do a habit.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3012.031s">No,</a> you're being ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3014.492s">You</a> went to 5 High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3015.613s">You</a> didn't have to get another place at 5 High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3018.094s">You</a> didn't have to get another place at Canal Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3019.975s">You</a> didn't have to get another place at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3022.016s">This</a> is the only one. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3023.017s">This</a> is your fourth move. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3023.917s">And</a> on the fourth move, you need another place to put your equipment.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3028.04s">Yeah,</a> it really bothers me. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3029.04s">Why</a> does that bother you, Councilor? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3029.921s">It</a> bothers me because it doesn't belong here. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3031.222s">It</a> belongs in the place that you're renting, that you're taking the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3034.004s">You</a> took the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3034.865s">You</a> took the money from the ratepayers of this community to have a public access channel.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3046.893s">Yeah,</a> I remember it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3049.234s">That's</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3049.534s">The</a> vote was four to three. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3050.334s">You</a> know why?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3077.837s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3078.138s">He's</a> just going to keep repeating the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3079.518s">So</a> I'm going to go to another question. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3081.059s">Your</a> station manager last week said he has a budget of $100,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3084.501s">You</a> have a separate budget that's doing all that work down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3087.243s">How</a> much is that budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3088.624s">What</a> is that costing? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3090.545s">Excuse</a> me. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3091.665s">What</a> does that cost?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3101.69s">No,</a> no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3102.291s">He</a> indicated that there's two separate budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3104.392s">One</a> is an operating budget, one's a- Well, we have an operating budget and a capital budget, sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3108.776s">So</a> what's paying for that, operating or capital?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3160.43s">Last</a> question, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3161.951s">Last</a> week, because your station manager couldn't answer the question, so maybe you can answer it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3166.034s">When's</a> the last time you've been audited? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3168.518s">Did</a> you give him an opportunity to answer the question last night? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3171.019s">Yes,</a> I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3171.319s">He</a> said he didn't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3173.56s">No,</a> not an audit. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3175.981s">You</a> filed your report to the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3177.621s">I'm</a> talking about an audit.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3196.356s">You're</a> the station manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3197.677s">You</a> have your money managers over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3199.799s">They</a> should know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3203.222s">You're</a> the president? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3204.063s">I</a> am the president of the corporation. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3205.024s">And</a> how long have you been there, Frank? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3206.665s">I've</a> been affiliated with TV3 since 1986. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3208.608s">Well</a> then, from 1987 to this particular time, you should have a pretty good idea how a station runs and what they're responsible for and what to do.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3217.962s">I</a> have a lot better idea than you and some other people in this room. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3220.706s">I</a> just asked you the question then. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3222.609s">The</a> last time you think was three to four years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3225.092s">Three</a> to four years ago, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3227.194s">That's</a> not an answer in your world?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3239.927s">So</a> you didn't adhere to Judge Jackson's report and her findings. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3243.1s">Apparently</a> you didn't follow her recommendations.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3259.068s">Well,</a> that's a very interesting comment to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3261.049s">The</a> city pays $15,000.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3277.139s">So</a> you're saying that city solicitor Rumley, he hurled car bombs at you too? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3282.002s">Is</a> that what you're saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3283.803s">No</a> comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3284.524s">Yeah,</a> no comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3285.224s">I</a> guess so, huh? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3286.465s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3287.405s">Councilor</a> Caraviello.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3440.86s">What</a> was that remark supposed to mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3443.561s">Well,</a> it was just a little fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3444.741s">No,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3445.041s">What's</a> that supposed to mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3446.081s">Lighten</a> up, dear boy. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3447.002s">No,</a> I'm not going to lighten up. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3448.382s">I'm</a> serious about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3449.862s">You</a> think I'm going to go in there and take your equipment?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3455.583s">What</a> are you talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3456.443s">I</a> didn't hurl any accusations. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3457.243s">You</a> would take offense to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3458.144s">I</a> didn't hurl any. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3458.644s">I</a> just made comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3459.564s">I</a> didn't hurl anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3460.544s">I</a> didn't point the finger at anyone that was doing anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3463.044s">I</a> asked questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3463.945s">Is</a> that right? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3464.465s">Yes,</a> that's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3465.165s">Is</a> that right? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3465.665s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3466.165s">Well,</a> what about this missing money? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3468.045s">You</a> tell me about it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3469.866s">There's</a> no money missing.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3472.526s">Well,</a> then, Senator Heath, read its report.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3491.212s">Frank</a> Leary was right. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3492.192s">If</a> that's the case, Frank, I would be more than happy to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3494.554s">But</a> when your money managers say that you people keep sloppy bookkeeping records, I have to find out. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3500.078s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3500.278s">Point</a> of information, Vice President Del Russo.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3705.333s">Now,</a> with... Point of information, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3709.876s">You</a> guys get $200,000 a year from the subscribers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3715.38s">$200,000</a> a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3715.96s">And</a> you're telling me you cannot afford to have an annual audit on your books? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3720.864s">That's</a> right, yeah.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3741.962s">And</a> they do more, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3742.922s">And</a> as a matter of fact, they go before the legislative body almost quarterly to explain what they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3748.767s">the</a> programs that they're presenting, and they tell them about their income levels.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3769.151s">We</a> have, and he hasn't responded. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3770.551s">That's</a> why we're discussing it right here.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3779.774s">He's</a> not the only proper authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3781.294s">We</a> represent the people of this community, and we represent cable TV subscribers. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3786.237s">Now,</a> if you folks want to come here and give your sales pitch, you go right ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3789.879s">They</a> can hear you, and they can hear any one of us.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3813.746s">Where</a> am I getting my information?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3816.948s">Wait</a> a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3817.889s">No,</a> you just made a comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3819.55s">Yes,</a> I did, Mr. Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3820.43s">Who</a> am I getting and where am I getting my information from? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3822.972s">You</a> don't think I have the ability to do this on my own? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3824.633s">Is</a> that what you're trying to say? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3826.57s">You</a> think I'm somebody else's mouthpiece?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3833.863s">I'm</a> not going to stand here and listen to that nonsense. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3836.006s">All</a> right.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3918.209s">All</a> right, Councilor Panta. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3919.07s">One</a> last question. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3920.13s">You</a> may have won the award, but so didn't 10 other communities win the award, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3923.851s">So</a> you weren't the only community. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3925.252s">We</a> won the National Excellence Award.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4112.193s">On</a> that motion, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4114.574s">If</a> I understand how the motion just did not pass, I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4119.757s">So</a> the question then becomes of the mayor, that the mayor should be reporting back to the council that he is allowing Channel 3, he should update this council, that he is now allowing Channel 3 to house and use this building for the purposes of supplementing
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4212.754s">First</a> Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4213.875s">Mr.</a> President, I'm thankful that Councilor Lingo-Curran now has added on to the resolution in thought and in practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4221.44s">What</a> we have here is a whole host of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4224.005s">As</a> we had our discussion tonight relative to the pool issue, the bottom line to all of this is the mayor says everything is a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4231.849s">Well,</a> everything cannot be a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4233.75s">Taxpayers</a> in this community are going to wind up paying for everything that's a priority in the mayor's mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4238.532s">We</a> have a police yard. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4239.552s">We</a> have a fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4240.993s">We</a> have public works. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4242.374s">We</a> have whatever the heck is going on on Commercial Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4245.235s">I</a> don't know how much longer that's going to last. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4249.237s">We</a> still haven't even resolved the issue <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4251.573s">of</a> the girls or the ladies or the women, however you want to use the terminology in the police department, you know, the locker rooms or the lack of locker rooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4259.505s">and</a> the safety issues that need to be revolved over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4263.868s">We</a> never even got to the point of the Water and Sewer Department after the fire in May of three years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4268.872s">They</a> were supposed to get a trailer. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4270.013s">They</a> never even got a trailer. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4272.334s">I</a> mean, these things go on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4274.336s">I</a> mean, we have a swimming pool that's now going to get us well up to almost $3,800,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4277.418s">It</a> started off as a $2.3 million adventure. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4279.119s">So</a> I just don't think the taxpayers of this city <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4286.238s">should</a> be led to believe, oh, we can afford it, we can afford it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4289.079s">What</a> can we afford? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4289.9s">Every</a> time you slap a dollar on the price tag of all of this stuff, somebody has to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4295.943s">Now,</a> there's no conversation anymore about the no-interest loans that the MWRA had. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4300.625s">I</a> don't know whatever happened to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4301.966s">We</a> never heard anything more about, you know, the money that was supposed to be coming forward from the billboards and all of that to appropriate this money. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4309.73s">So,</a> I really think, Mr. President, before any votes take place, <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4315.07s">Any</a> agreements take place on any one of these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4317.973s">We</a> really need to, if the mayor doesn't want to put it in some kind of an order of priority, then maybe the council should, between and amongst ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4325.899s">Maybe</a> we all feel that the public works department is more important than the pool, or maybe the police department is more important than the pool, or the pool is more important than the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4334.727s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4335.467s">But</a> there's only so much money that we have to go out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4337.91s">And</a> you have a budget coming up right around the corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4340.231s">And</a> as Councilor Lungelkorn alluded to before, <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4342.515s">And</a> as Councilor Marks also alluded to, we should have these figures before this budget even comes into place so we have some kind of an idea how much this is gonna cost and where we're going with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4356.882s">You</a> talk to the rate payer, the taxpayer on the street, all they know is the cost of everything just keeps going up and up and up. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4363.726s">And</a> the cost of government keeps going up too. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4366.327s">And</a> I think we saw a pure example of it tonight <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4368.686s">on</a> Channel 3 coming down here. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4370.167s">To</a> me, it's total incompetence. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4371.928s">They</a> did not want to address or discuss the issue regarding ratepayers' money. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4376.111s">At</a> least we can discuss taxpayers' money. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4379.073s">And</a> at least we have some semblance of controlling of what's going on in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4383.597s">Unfortunately,</a> on the cable TV subscribers, why the mayor is refusing to get involved to do anything, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4390.882s">Maybe</a> they have a tie over him over something, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4393.624s">But</a> it's absolutely wrong as to what's going on over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4396.286s">But</a> more importantly, at least on this particular issue, <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4398.683s">We</a> have some control over it, and we have the control of either saying yes, no, or maybe, or cut it in between, and maybe it's not as grandiose as it appears to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4407.668s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4408.548s">Councilor</a> Longo-Kurin.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4891.449s">At</a> the meeting tonight, there were two papers that were handled of updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4894.93s">I</a> think you got one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4897.071s">Oh.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4897.391s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4897.751s">And</a> I think all the council should get copies of them.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4909.658s">And</a> there was another two-page one that they had given out.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7773.444s">Joseph</a> Pierre.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7779.729s">Is</a> that your brother?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7780.87s">Joseph</a> O. No, he's Joseph O. Joseph O. Pierre. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7784.573s">I</a> get a page here from the Sailor of Weights and Measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7787.535s">It's</a> unsigned and undated. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7790.217s">As</a> a matter of fact, both of his pages are unsigned and undated.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7798.664s">Mr.</a> Clark, they're unsigned and undated.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7831.107s">You're</a> using Friday Canal Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7833.248s">What's</a> Harvard Street?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7839.513s">What's</a> your company?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7850.86s">You</a> have two different names.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7857.179s">You</a> have two different corporations?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7865.245s">All</a> County Transportation, Inc.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7872.09s">You</a> have one cab already right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7874.232s">What's</a> the name of that cab company?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7884.711s">I</a> don't understand this. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7885.532s">If</a> you want three cabs, why do you have two different cab company names?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7909.553s">How</a> could you be paying $600 a month if you didn't get the license?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7915.807s">The</a> insurance? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7916.507s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7917.348s">Insurance</a> for what?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7921.79s">You</a> paid $7,200 a year? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7923.23s">$7,200</a> a year, that's what you pay for insurance?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7926.112s">But</a> you don't have a cab license. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7927.632s">How</a> could you be paying that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7971.937s">You</a> are self-insured $10,000 for each car. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7974.438s">That's</a> what you're saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7975.698s">Yes,</a> most of the cabins are self-insured. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7977.819s">You</a> put $20,000 up to insure two cars.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7982.541s">You</a> just got through saying you're paying $600 a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7984.202s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7984.322s">Current</a> insurance.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8034.442s">Is</a> your other taxi self-insured too?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8100.859s">I</a> don't possibly can believe that you need two more cabs to operate in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8108.503s">You</a> already have one. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8109.223s">That's</a> 44 cabs. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8111.504s">I</a> just cannot believe there is no <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8115.354s">There's</a> no business out there for 44 cabs in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8119.617s">I</a> just don't understand this.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8125.701s">I</a> understand that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8129.844s">I</a> don't know if you're from a court or what, but I can't support it because I just think this is completely out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8135.023s">All</a> of it's out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8136.524s">You</a> don't even have your own certificate of insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8138.845s">You</a> write self-insured. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8140.246s">The</a> Commonwealth of Massachusetts tells you you have to have a stamped self-insured certificate when you're using the term self-insured.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8247.443s">That</a> Mr. Ramirez be invited down, who was a wonderful asset, <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8250.635s">at</a> the Brookline Bank and he just retired. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8253.516s">And</a> it'd be nice to have the people take a look and see and have him give us his resume.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8296.098s">Two</a> papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8296.598s">13-449.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8298.786s">It</a> was laid in the table on the 14th. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8301.868s">Um,</a> DPW parks department and Hormel commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8305.79s">We</a> get a report back on that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8309.151s">No,</a> but he laid it for one week.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8314.134s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8361.026s">Why</a> can't it be open all the time? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8362.147s">I</a> don't understand that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8367.41s">Why</a> can't they be open, like, on Saturday and Sunday when they go? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8369.391s">It</a> should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8370.191s">That's</a> what I'm asking for.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8372.432s">I</a> know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8381.197s">What,</a> on the track? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8381.898s">I</a> was just talking about the track, to walk around the track.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8391.612s">Also,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8392.612s">All</a> right, which one? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8393.493s">Put</a> a request in there that we get our trash collection reports on a monthly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8397.813s">We</a> have yet to receive that report back.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8401.354s">Mr.</a> Clark. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8402.434s">Did</a> you send that letter out?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8408.255s">Did</a> you send that to the mayor?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8413.877s">He</a> didn't send it?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8421.882s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8422.002s">All</a> right.
