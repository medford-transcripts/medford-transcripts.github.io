    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4059.531s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4062.853s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Having served on this board some years ago, the city of Medford and Tufts University engaged in the pilot, a million dollar pilot program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4070.599s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the pilot program consisted of six students from Medford, six students from Somerville, who'd be able to go to Tufts University for nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4078.644s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The million dollar cash part of the program consisted of three years of getting cash up front with the remaining portions of the money to be used for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4087.17s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think there could have been fire or police equipment here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4091.334s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now that hasn't been followed through since, for what reason, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4096.54s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the idea of taxing up to 25% relative to the nonprofit, whether it's Tufts University or someone else, I guess you haven't hit the dollar mark yet of where you're gonna go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4107.008s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But speaking with leaders up at the State House, the one thing that the City of Medford hasn't done, as other cities and towns done, you have not moved to provide an amendment to the CPA tax, which would include affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4120.793s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of that, and knowing that the Commonwealth now does not give back to the City of Medford from their surplus to the CPA, it's all going to be on cities and towns, excuse me, individually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4134.938s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I think the city of mid that has an opening over and beyond your 25% also to amend the CPA to now include affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4144.467s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, you give it to churches, you've given it to schools into swimming pools and open space and land.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4150.333s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is a great opportunity right now for you as a council, first term especially, to move forward on your reps and on your senators to make this amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4159.44s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're not getting rid of the CPA, you're amending it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4162.442s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And by amending it to put this inclusion in there, this will be your first step along with your 25% for the purpose of going forward to get your affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4171.489s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The other part of affordable housing is very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4175.672s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What has the city of Medford, can you folks, any one of you here,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4180.322s">[Robert Penta]</a>: give an accounting of how much money has been used for affordable housing, where has the location's been, where is the land, and where has the working relationship taken place between a private contractor coming in with the city of Medford to provide affordable housing along with regular housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4200.675s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think you have a big inventory on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4202.617s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think if you keep talking about affordable housing, you keep talking about the transfer tax, you keep talking about the registry, I think you should start there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4211.023s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because if there's nothing on the books right now, I think you need to get your feet wet in that particular area, get your base set up before you go into this next move.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4220.251s">[Robert Penta]</a>: 25% sounds good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4221.072s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think you need an inventory of all the property in the city method that's tax exempt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4225.035s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I'm quite sure you'll find<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4226.696s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There are other pieces only on Tufts University where you can get that 25% from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4231.419s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4275.327s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But a few years ago up in Beacon Hill, before the 25% came into play, there was a percentage ratio that went, like I believe Tufts University at the time had a $30 million endowment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4285.695s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there was a dollar amount that was set on the endowment that the school had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4289.878s">[Robert Penta]</a>: as to what percentage it would go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4291.841s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, Tufts doesn't have a large endowment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4293.663s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not like Harvard University that's into the billions of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4297.368s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But there was a dollar amount, you may want to check this out once again, do your homework, go to Beacon Hill and find out what that legislation was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4304.438s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Unfortunately, it didn't pass because as you said before,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4308.402s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Academy of colleges and universities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4310.565s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But still, it's a stepping stone to go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4313.369s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, and these are all pilot programs that you can look into, just because somebody is multi rich, like having I mean, Tufts University, you might find other locations where, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4326.28s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Listen, if you treat one one way, you got to treat them all the same way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4330.762s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it might be better to have a universal thing rather than go to the 25% and just go for the biggest one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4335.604s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because if you can work on all of them, maybe in the long run, you'll be able to get more in the long run than just grappling at the first one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4367.516s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But what you don't have right now in your inventory, you might have that, which I can vote, but you don't have the physical ground locations with new and additional affordable housing can go in and working toward that with getting this money, whether it's again, the 25% of the affordable housing of the CPA money, whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4386.75s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Understood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4387.171s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4387.811s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8558.968s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, can I speak on that first?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8561.349s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8585.106s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Did you withdraw it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8875.732s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Chairman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9158.611s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Pinto, Zero Summit Road in Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9162.154s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Regarding the public letter that was written on April 16th regarding House Bill, I believe it's 3128, the Affordable Home Act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9174.103s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In that particular bill,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9176.141s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There were transfers fees also that could be beneficial to a community that were discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9182.47s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there was seven inclusions as it related what you could and could not do, which also had an opt-in and an opt-out proviso in that bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9192.364s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I'd like to, to you, Mr. Chairman, I want to get to your letter of April 28, where you sent out a notice saying, correcting the record on Medved's plans to address the housing crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9204.072s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And two particular paragraphs were sort of like, watch me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9207.054s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The first, the first one states the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9209.736s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The City Council and the City Planning staff are working on zoning rebuild reforms to allow more housing to be built, reduce permitting and regulatory burdens for private property owners, encouraging major economic development, and require construction of more<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9227.916s">[Robert Penta]</a>: subsidize affordable housing units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9230.358s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We are also working on policies to benefit good landlords like the Good Landlord Tax Credit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9237.422s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the second paragraph reads, the final piece of that comprehensive approach<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9243.405s">[Robert Penta]</a>: is anti-disbursement policies targeted at the large corporations who are buying properties, jacking up rents, and earning a huge profit by knocking out long-time residents and making unnaturally affordable units too expensive for the average person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9262.242s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I understand what you wrote, but I don't understand who these large corporations that are coming in here into the city of Medford and they're dispersing people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9271.87s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I see houses that are bought by individuals who had an opportunity to buy a single family or two family house as an individual, but not as a corporation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9281.379s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you sent this out apparently because you wanted to allegedly, you know, correct something that was sent out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9289.502s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if I were to see this as I did see it, I'm confused right now because I don't know of any major large corporations that have come in to the city of Medford and bought single or two family homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9302.369s">[Robert Penta]</a>: either tore them down, rebuilt them, and sold them for large profit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9306.431s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I know individual people have done it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9308.653s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But when you say large corporations, it makes it look like this city is now being overrun by large corporations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9315.516s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you're going to address that through your zoning and your community development,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9322.278s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The wording is very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9324.6s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this type of wording makes it look like corporate America has just taken over the city of Medford, making it unaffordable for people to live here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9332.525s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9333.966s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You also have the opportunity of a business person or a business lady who may be able to come in here, can afford to buy a single or two or a three family house, do it over, and if they can make a profit, so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9345.773s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If the city really wants to get into affordable housing and low and moderate income housing,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9351.457s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They've had the last eight years to talk about this and do something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9355.978s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if they're not going to do it, then maybe it should be on the burden of the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9360.359s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And maybe you just you guys and girls, you just voted tonight on a CPA to give more money out, maybe to a place in the Brooks Estates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9368.881s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But put that aside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9370.241s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you're really concerned and really serious about affordable housing, you should start putting all your pennies together on all your nickels and all your dimes and all your resources where the money can come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9380.063s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and really have a second look.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9382.125s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, when the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I think it's could be almost 12-13 years ago, came out with the CPA tax, we were supposed to, like other cities and towns, get a percentage of what the profit was on the state's annual profit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9395.754s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We haven't gotten anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9397.515s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you're really putting the burden right back on the Medford taxpayer, or the Medford city government to go forward and look for that type of development, look for that type of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9407.8s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, here's your chance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9409.361s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Before you get into the, you know, Worcester just got through passing, I don't know if you folks realize it, they just got through passing on April 29th, March 9th of this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9420.166s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The registry as it relates to single and two family and three family homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9424.79s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They had that, they voted on that in September of 2022.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9428.311s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it took them two years before they implemented it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9432.952s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They are now meeting in their next main meeting to make revisions to it because of the pushback, because there's a lot of stringent material into that registry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9442.274s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the best part about the whole thing, as the city manager said, he's willing to make changes and tone it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9448.396s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can you imagine having, if you don't go and register, you're gonna get a $300 fine, and every single day you don't register, it's a $300 fine?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9455.837s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's kind of excessive, really excessive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9458.898s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, you don't wanna go to these extremes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9461.218s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what you do wanna, if you really believe in what you're talking about, you wanna have a full-blown discussions with the pros and the cons, and how this thing can or cannot work, and how does it fit into the city of Medford's lifestyle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9476.181s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Chairman, with all due respect, I do not see large corporations coming into our city in Medford, street after street, buying and taking over real estate, turning it over and making a huge profit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9488.329s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If a single person, be it yourself or any member of the council, has the ability to do it, good luck to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9494.093s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what America is all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9496.074s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you're trying to reduce the rents, you're trying to reduce the cost of living, trying to reduce everything else, then speak to your state legislature, speak to your federal authorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9505.72s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're the ones that should be looking out for you, just as well as your local authorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9510.524s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3186.122s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, former member of this August body, and I'm really getting confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3192.83s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's been almost eight years since I've been back before this council, and I've been here three times since December.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3198.697s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I feel like there's something wrong with this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3201.241s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're going in a direction that doesn't speak about the Medford City Council taking care of Medford City issues, streets, sidewalks, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3216.053s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, my concern with this is, is the City of Medford City Council going to go into a public service agency?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3223.171s">[Robert Penta]</a>: by going into housing and being property reviewers, and you talk about a registry that a homeowner has to go and apply, well, I'm quite sure you're gonna charge them a fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3234.821s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's another money grab for the city of Medford, unfoundly, and it's wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3239.805s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in the very last line of your document here, Councilor Lazzaro, I mean, excuse me, Councilor Callahan, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3248.692s">[Robert Penta]</a>: you indicate that this is going to be good for our climate and our affordable housing goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3255.277s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, let me ask you something, as you folks going to manage this, you know, you have a program here that you want to create a review between now and when I don't see any name here as it relates to a real estate group of people that should be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3270.149s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because if anybody knows the whereabouts of the city, and the renters, it would be the real estate people because they're the ones that are renting out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3278.436s">[Robert Penta]</a>: not renting in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3279.937s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So what purpose would the city council have to try to tell a real estate agent or its company that this is who you have to rent to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3288.122s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are the type of people and then what are we going to do stop making a registry of who you are renting to and be discriminatory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3295.467s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In fact, in the future, toward a certain class or an ethnic group of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3307.569s">[Robert Penta]</a>: city of Medford last year, and once again, this year put out in their documents, a it's called a notice of tenant rights and resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3317.097s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you look into the tenants rights and resources, it also makes reference to what the state law allows you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3324.022s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, if there's something wrong with a tenant or renter, they have many places to go, they can go to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3331.428s">[Robert Penta]</a>: MCAD in Boston, they can go to state real estate board, you can go to your right downstairs here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3337.496s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you can also go to the public health department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3340.44s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Right now they have five available ways for renter feels that they're being in frowned upon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3347.088s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But every good real estate broker knows whether it's in the city of Medford or any other place, that the fact of the matter is they're going to try to get the best person that they can, who can afford to pay the rent, and it's not going to be subject to a background check to their ethnic background.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3362.932s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because that unfortunately, is where this is going to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3365.992s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because once you get somebody in there, they're going to want to know where did you come from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3370.694s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let me see your references.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3372.134s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And where were you renting last?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3373.694s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not what this council's job is all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3376.816s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What an answer!<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3386.119s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Pardon me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3387.7s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't know you haven't gotten there yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3389.822s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You just you just have you just I'm not gonna I'm not gonna sit here and say that we're going to hear you have discrimination as the chair as the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3408.457s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I didn't say you were you said you're going to put a registry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3412.961s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, what's the registry going to include?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3415.523s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Ask the maker of the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3416.924s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You cannot come here with resolutions and not be able to answer the questions for what you're looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3422.288s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then you don't belong here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3423.609s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Go someplace else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3424.83s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3439.144s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm just frustrated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3440.825s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And probably taking it out on all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3443.207s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I am taking it out on you for a particular purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3445.769s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm going to repeat myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3446.929s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I have a bad habit of repeating myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3448.931s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Please just do what you were elected to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3452.613s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, you guys went out there and campaigned and rang on the doorbells and asked people to vote for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3457.256s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Did you tell him you wanted to put a registry for housing in there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3460.659s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3461.019s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3471.963s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let me just conclude by saying the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3476.204s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, you know something, just relax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3478.345s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You had a little do to do with their Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3481.025s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You took my time up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3482.726s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm gonna ask Mrs. Callahan, I'm gonna ask Mrs. Callahan to withdraw the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3488.72s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and think this thing through, if you really think it's worth something, come back at another day with definitive answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3495.565s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you don't have an audience that's screaming and yelling that they don't want it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3499.187s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe there is something that can work its way out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3501.789s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe if you work with the real estate brokers in this city, it can make some kind of sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3506.052s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the two person homeowner doesn't have to pay a fee to get himself registered or her registered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3511.495s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at the same time, there's going to be none of this background check<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3515.478s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that revolves itself around where I am, who I am, what my ethnic background is, what my financial status might be- Thank you, Mr. Penta, your time is up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3523.161s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, wait a minute, wait a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3524.782s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Wait a minute, I'm not through yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3542.164s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You took time away from me to talk to Councilor Scott.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11581.727s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Penta zero summit road former member of the August body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11585.268s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number one local government is what it's all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11587.409s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So we're not talking about state government here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11589.47s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're not talking about federal government and I don't really care what was on that shot about other cities and towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11594.673s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're talking about our city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11597.894s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And for 12 consecutive years, his name was Council President Bob Miyako, it was emphasized every single night during those 12 years of city council meetings, that this was the people's forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11610.26s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is the only place that they could go for redress, whether they went to a department, the mayor, what have you, they were dissatisfied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11617.643s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there were nights we stayed here till 12 and one o'clock in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11621.645s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that didn't bother me because that's what the job was all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11626.294s">[Robert Penta]</a>: First and second of all, if you have a meeting as you've had over the past, since December now coming forward, when you have lines of people waiting to speak, let them speak first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11636.781s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The people at home, they're sitting in their chairs, they're sitting in their comfort zone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11641.044s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have people here that need to go to work the next day, have paid for a babysitter, or just came down here because it's finally got to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11647.569s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Something is really interested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11649.49s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Two of your free people that are sponsoring this,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11653.294s">[Robert Penta]</a>: have never done anything here in the city of Medford that should even qualify them to make a result of going to two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11660.322s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then you go from two minutes to three, just like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11663.305s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, that's the way it was the consideration for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11665.688s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why don't you just keep it at five minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11668.351s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In 2022, you went from 10 to five and everything seemed to work out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11671.835s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the only reason why these meetings are getting to be as long as they are, unfortunately, because you're every other week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11677.518s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So maybe you should go back to being every week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11680.259s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that way the the agendas won't be as long and they won't be as contentious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11684.401s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But to worry about the length of time that you would have to sit here, you get $30,000 a year to supposedly represent the people of this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11694.403s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And don't you dare think you're gonna come back here and ask for a pay raise because you have to stay late at night and you do committee meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11701.966s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's crazy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11702.646s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If anything, it would be wise for you to make a decrease in your salary because of the conditions that the city of Medford is in right now to show and put your good fest forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11710.808s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But that'll never happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11712.509s">[Robert Penta]</a>: just like a pay raise will probably come forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11715.17s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, the sad part about this whole thing is, again, you're spending time on what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11720.893s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just tell me what is so bad to sit here and listen to someone for five minutes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11726.476s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What is so bad that you have to go and look at another community and see what they do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11730.778s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're talking about Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11732.678s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you spent your time doing your homework, when you're out there campaigning, you would realize you're talking about Medford, not Arlington, Cambridge, Somerville, Malden, or Everett, or Chelsea,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11743.944s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let me ask any one of you when you're out campaigning, and you rang the doorbells for your votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11749.106s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Did you spend more than two minutes and say, I've got to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11751.827s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I only give them two minutes to speak to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11753.988s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Of course not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11755.549s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That would be the height of insulting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11757.85s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you want to insult people coming up here who pay your salary with our tax dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11765.353s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's a shame, that is wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11768.054s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And not to single anyone out of you, I'm gonna blame all of you, because if all of you vote for the craziness of this, and I call this a stupid resolution, because it makes no sense in the interest of good government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11781.457s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can talk about Harvard all you want, you can have your special days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11785.458s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And just as an information to Councilor Tseng, you indicated this month is Ramadan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11789.7s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, do you know what today is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11791.803s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do you know what today is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11792.584s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Today is National Autism Day, sponsored by the United Nations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11796.127s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't see that on the calendar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11797.909s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That to me is as important as your Ramadan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11800.491s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you people want to talk about all these national issues and put them on the calendar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11804.996s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What does that do to help the city of Medford, the people of Medford, to pay the taxes on a daily basis that go to work here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11812.683s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I strongly suggest the three members who put this forward, cancel it, take it off the ballot, and leave it alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11819.807s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And let the good people of our city have their five minutes at the podium, have their say, whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11826.25s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And hopefully, if you go back to maybe every week, the amount of resolutions that you put on there won't be as contentious, and it won't be so controversial, you won't have to stay here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11836.655s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But even if you do have to stay here, eat it, because that's your job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11841.357s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what you signed up for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11842.938s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You wanted to be a council to represent the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11845.699s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if I heard you correctly, Mr. President, you said you've spoken to people to disagree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11850.261s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So to some people from an hour, two hours, whatever it might be, and you didn't accomplish anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11855.803s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You spent two hours of your time on a conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11858.684s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you want to cut us down to two minutes of this podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11861.545s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That makes absolutely no sense at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11863.167s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's absolutely contradictory to the whole premise of what this resolution is all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11867.414s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Again, I respectfully ask the three members who put this forward to cancel it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11871.76s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And also, there's a book, it's called The Naked Socialist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11874.924s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Anyone have ever heard of it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11876.852s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a very interesting book, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11878.994s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a naked socialist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11880.735s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Pardon me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11883.558s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, it's not about you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11884.478s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm gonna just read with you at the very conclusion of what it says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11887.841s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This goes back to 1968.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11890.423s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A lady by the name of Ezra Taft Benson, she was the former secretary of agriculture under President Dwight Eisenhower, gave a speech outlining the following- Mr. Penta, you're five minutes in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11900.952s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Regarding public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11902.654s">[Robert Penta]</a>: One line, and it says the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11905.376s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Government may not possess more rights than those held by the individual, and government may not simply assume them as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11914.223s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When it does, you're operating toward tyranny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11916.826s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11917.646s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let me just finish, please, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11920.308s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11921.229s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would can I just finish please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11923.17s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11924.271s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can I just finish please sentence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11926.993s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11927.913s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would just hope that this council does not find itself being involved in the naked terrorists and any kind of socialistic communistic movement by stopping the people from speaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11940.701s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15396.441s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why do I only have two when I should have five?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15400.763s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, you're tired, you want to go home, is this all about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15408.465s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Show me the rule on the council, because rule 16 says five minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15413.227s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what it says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15422.131s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can I finish what I'm saying?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15423.132s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have two minutes, we accept two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15424.112s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, you shouldn't be speaking from the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15425.753s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have no right to make an opinion from the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15429.574s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have no right from the chair to make an opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15432.316s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15434.797s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're against Robert's rules of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15438.338s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd like to ask the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15442.0s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd like to ask the vice president question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15444.801s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We may I know I can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15448.002s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On the motion of this meeting, I am not the chair of this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15451.343s">[Robert Penta]</a>: City Council meeting bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12434.747s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12437.229s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm a former member of this August body, and back then it was an August body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12441.453s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I'd like to make a suggestion before we even start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12444.817s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's many people in this room, and there's a long line behind me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12448.08s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The people at home can wait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12449.341s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're in their own house, sitting in their own chairs, under their own roof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12453.326s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would appreciate it if you do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12458.206s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12458.806s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number two, let's get into the whole issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12461.348s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You own a house, you pay taxes year in and year out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12464.709s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You get your water and sewer tax bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12466.59s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then you have an addendum that was picked on the water and sewer tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12469.331s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then you have the CPA tax, which is an end run on proposition two and a half.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12474.014s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now you're coming in here tonight and you're talking about possibly a transfer of tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12479.016s">[Robert Penta]</a>: With all due respect, Councilor, you said it's been three weeks since it came up until now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12483.777s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But what happened in the last three weeks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12485.758s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You folks voted to have these meetings every other week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12488.518s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now it's three weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12489.519s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12490.439s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12493.24s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Pardon me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12495.3s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just because there was an election, there's four other days in the week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12498.421s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Come on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12500.179s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, let's be honest about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12502.861s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where is the proposal from the administration that wants what you people want to propose here tonight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12508.504s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you really want to be heroes about what you think this tax should be, you should vote tonight to end it, receive it and place it on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12517.209s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12521.178s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number two, if you really think it's that important, you should maybe in a couple of months call for a public hearing on a non election on a non Tuesday night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12531.727s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that way they you can listen to the people as to what you're proposing, because what you're proposing right now, it's quite obvious, either the message got out wrong, the information isn't being heard correctly, and you people are going to send it to a committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12545.078s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what's it going to do in the committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12546.579s">[Robert Penta]</a>: either you're for it or against it, because if you have it on the agenda to discuss, how much more do you need to discuss it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12551.941s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're either for it or you're against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12553.961s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's why it's on the agenda, period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12556.882s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now therefore, if you don't want to vote on it, and you want to refer it to a committee, well then kill it tonight, and then have a public forum if you want, and have the entire community come whenever they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12567.085s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have real estate folks out here, the real estate folks out here buy and sell homes, they're buying and selling of homes and the taxes that are paid into this community represent almost 82% of the city's budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12579.116s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They more than anybody understand what the real estate tax does for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12584.699s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And for you now want to put a transfer tax on there for no godly reason why I don't know, you could talk about all the affordable housing you want, but you have no plan in front of you, you have no locations, multiply, you have no reason and no dollar amount ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12599.807s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But what about the proposal next to the old GE place that was supposed to be affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12604.112s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What about where Bertucci's is with the science, public science building was going to go, what about a mystic Avenue 500 mystic Avenue where there's going to be a proposal for 500 units in commercial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12615.875s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've got locations here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12617.077s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You talked about your first time in 30 years, you're doing a rezoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12619.939s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, where's the rezoning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12621.121s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where is the rezoning here tonight that you can present to the people of this community where affordable housing is going to go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12626.506s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12627.387s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You haven't brought in the real estate people so they could see so they could work with you as a council so they could understand what your needs might be so they would have an idea of what they can buy and what they can sell for the people that they have to deal with on a daily basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12640.814s">[Robert Penta]</a>: have to understand something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12642.796s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These people are upset out here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12644.417s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're upset only because of the way it's come up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12647.62s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Don't forget, you had the meeting canceled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12649.582s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now it's here in their mind, they're thinking it's a 2% tax, it's going to go out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12654.247s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So why don't we just forget the tax?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12657.11s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why don't you just forget this resolution?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12659.272s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you guys and girls really think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12661.954s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's worthy of having a conversation to call for public hearing and see what the input is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12667.856s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Rather than saying it's going to be 2%, 1%, it's going to be at a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12672.138s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The lady that was on there, she hit it right on the head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12674.378s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She bought a house for $44,000, then she paid 68,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12677.88s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She was the American dream.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12680.841s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And why should she be penalized in her senior years of her senior American dream that she would have that money that she would have to give back that's not going to her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12697.025s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, we're talking about a democracy each and every day with this political election that's coming up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12702.252s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Right now, what you folks are talking about, socialism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12705.556s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You think you should be sharing your people's products.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12716.934s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's wrong to get in this mode.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12720.599s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I don't really think this council really wants to travel down this road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12725.146s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if you really want to be genuine about this issue, rather than refer to committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12730.854s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would strongly suggest that one of you, if not many of you, make a motion to receive it in place and on file tonight, and then call for a public hearing, two or three weeks, when the entire city of Metro would have an opportunity to come and speak, not like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9763.941s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass, former member of this August body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9770.385s">[Robert Penta]</a>: First of all, let me start by saying, what does this pay raise have to do with education?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9777.142s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9777.902s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number two, there's no demanding from the public for any pay raise for the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9783.785s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And lastly, there's no professional city population job description pay report that even substantiates or supports what the council has alluded to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9794.829s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The gender issue that was alleged this past December is nothing more than a sexual red herring allegation of discrimination that has no merit to the issue before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9806.494s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The job is what the job is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9807.995s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The responsibility is what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9809.456s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't say it has to be male or female.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9813.66s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's the red herring to the whole thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9815.541s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if this proposal were to pass, should we now compare all our municipal positions with the same amount of financial equity and equality as compared to each position, especially with those having different responsibilities?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9829.052s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Fire, police, school teachers, they all have different job duties and responsibilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9834.841s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if we're looking at something that's now saying the school committee should have equity pay to that of a city councilor, well, you're setting a standard here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9842.388s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this standard should be compared to, right now, what is presently found in your municipal contracts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9849.275s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Additionally, if this proposal is to pass a comprehensive review,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9854.56s">[Robert Penta]</a>: should be undertaking to set a years of service pay scale to be compatible with all of the municipal employee negotiations, comparing newly elected newcomers to both the city council and the school committee at the beginning of the pay scale formula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9869.046s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Therefore, for the new members in the council, as compared to the new members on the school committee, why should either one of you reap the benefit of the maximum pay<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9878.63s">[Robert Penta]</a>: when in fact all other municipal employees start at a base pay and they go through a process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9885.112s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if you're looking at this equity for both and all sides, then let the council and the school committee also be put in the same type of position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9896.533s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay, as such by granting the city council additional type of raise without having increasing any educational value, without having any community support for it, and without any professional city population job description report only demonstrates the power of behind the scenes internal politics, where the power of the dollar personally overpowers the needs of our public school educational needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9924.972s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have surrounding communities, and I took the six surrounding communities that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9928.674s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Arlington, they get paid $3,000 a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9931.275s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Everett, they get paid $11,500.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9933.036s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Malden, they get paid $7,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9934.917s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Somerville, they get paid $16,600.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9936.218s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And Methodist, they get paid $12,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9938.639s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Methodist is the second highest paid school committee of the surrounding areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9944.468s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You serve in these jobs for the quality of giving good education to the community, not for how much money or you should be paid equal to that or in excess of our total to the amount of what a city councilor makes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9959.321s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Last December, the pay concerns for paraprofessionals, classroom assistants, custodians, substitute teachers, et cetera, were discussed, but they've yet to be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9969.509s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This hall was full with almost 200 teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9972.938s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At the city council, the school committee pay raise increase without any proposal to differentiate the differences between the city council and school committee responsibilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9982.09s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As the gentleman just stated, showing the need such raise or pay equality has yet to be proven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9989.397s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Therefore, at last meeting on December 12, these were the issues that were of concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9995.261s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A, needing additional instructional hours for students, AP classes, class size needs, athletic programming, student activities, school library resources, counseling services, school security, custodial school maintenance, after school programming, and something that's gonna creep up on you fellas, it's unprepared for migrant student educational<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10019.219s">[Robert Penta]</a>: studies and support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10021.381s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, these are all dollar amounts that need to be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10024.923s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you are going to take on the proposal that's before us over the next two years, approximately $76,000, you're taking that $76,000 away from your school department educational budget that could be used somehow to get into some of these programs, if not all of them, to some degree and a percentage of whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10045.762s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The pay scale for those caring for these programs was at issue, and yet as of today, nothing has been done to resolve any of the issues as presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10055.033s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The City Council School Committee pay raise proposal does not recognize and connect to the short and long term needs of our public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10063.664s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So when and if you folks are sitting here and you're discussing these needs, and you think that the school committee should be making more money, and you have a school committee that's been around for so many years, allegedly for 20, if that's what the issue is, well then let's, what do we need to motivate and show that their need and they're worthy of it other than<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10082.987s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, they should be making the same as in Worcester.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10086.568s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They have an audience that does say up to 50% of what a city council makes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10090.19s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But their job responsibilities may be entirely different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10092.851s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do you realize right now, a kindergarten assistant, if we were to follow this pay raise as proposed, a kindergarten assistant who works five days a week and is subject to everything in that classroom as every other teacher, will be making $1,000 less<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10110.336s">[Robert Penta]</a>: then this pay proposal for a school committee person, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10113.937s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Makes no sense at all because a school committee person doesn't have to sign in, doesn't have to check in, has no responsibility as it relates to, you know, what am I doing on a daily basis that says I'm doing something that's educationally correct for this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10128.763s">[Robert Penta]</a>: By granting from the city council, let's put it this way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10134.906s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There should be some justification before you folks<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10138.43s">[Robert Penta]</a>: from, and it can't be from the at present school committee because there'd be a conflict of interest because they have a financial gain from it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10144.793s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So it's gotta be as according to the state law, the chapter is gonna come from your folks in the state council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10149.836s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But what has this school committee done, especially with its new members that has said Medford's education is better, Medford's discipline is better, and that's seriously questioned as to what's going on up at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10163.439s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The sports programs is getting better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10165.76s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Parents are getting more involved, but also at the same time, where is the educational standard in comparison to other cities and towns throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10176.283s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Has the school committee made such great strides that, hey, they're working together with the teachers and their organizations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10184.365s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When you had here last week, and I know you have some new folks that are here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10188.787s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On December 12th, there was almost 150, 175 teachers that were here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10193.2s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they explain to you the plight of not only being in the classroom, being attacked, where their pay is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10200.203s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Some of them have to work five years, five years before they even make $25,000 a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10206.905s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's unconscionable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10208.666s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Justin, I understand that you want to give them a pay raise, you know, but I didn't hear your logic behind it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10215.929s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, he's the one, it's his resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10222.679s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay, through the chair, Justin, I know you wanna give them this Bay Race, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10227.441s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you haven't said anything, none of you have expressed any comment as it relates to, they deserve it for the value of what they do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10235.224s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can anybody explain to me,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10237.765s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you really want to give somebody a pay raise, isn't the job description and your job duties and your employer supposed to do the review of you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10246.208s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, of course they can say, the Medford taxpayer is your reviewer and you run for office and they elect you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10252.25s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay, that's all well and good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10254.251s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the Medford taxpayer doesn't pay your salary, it's the Medford City Council according to state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10259.997s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the Medford City Council, by right, can make a great demand on this school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10264.499s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you really want to improve it, we'll look at this in two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10267.68s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let's see what this new school committee does over the next two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10270.801s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let's just see through your intervention with the Medford Teachers Association and from the superintendent all the way down, that everything that's taking place in all our schools, from kindergarten all the way up to the high school, has gotten better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10282.004s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Grades have gotten better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10283.925s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Discipline has gotten better and under control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10288.174s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That would make a big difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10289.575s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And maybe people might say, hey, okay, you're working toward it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10293.216s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But when you have a job that you don't have to sign in, check in and give any report as to what you do and why you're doing how you do it, and expect to start off at a higher rate than people who have been here for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10305.782s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's just not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10307.643s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the last thing, let me just say this as it relates to that, and I told you Arlington gets $3,000, Everett gets $11,500, Malden gets $7,000, Somerville gets $16,500, and Method gets $12,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10318.977s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're the second highest one of the surrounding communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10323.723s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A kindergarten<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10325.609s">[Robert Penta]</a>: through the chair to Justin, a kindergarten teacher assistant after the second year gets $21,568.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10332.391s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's $1,000 less than what you wanna propose to a school committee person who doesn't go to this job every day, like the kindergarten teacher goes to school every day, five days a week, and does everything that education says of that person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10350.556s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe you should have a sit down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10352.912s">[Robert Penta]</a>: with the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10354.713s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because they can't tell you that they want it because it would be a financial benefit to them, that would be a conflict of interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10361.578s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But somebody needs to understand, just because they need to get paid more, because they're not getting paid enough now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10368.383s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, they're getting paid $12,000, and if they don't want it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10371.545s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And through the chair to Mrs. Callahan, not for anything, you made the comment that you think that, you know, to get good candidates, you need to pay more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10379.63s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm gonna respectfully disagree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10381.992s">[Robert Penta]</a>: a good candidate is someone who wants to run for the job because they believe that better things can be done and I can do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10388.195s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if I can't do it, then the people won't reelect me that salary has got nothing to do with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10394.017s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the salary should not be used for your own personal gain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10397.779s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm going to make $30,000 a year now more 24,000, whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10401.861s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the sad part about the whole thing in conclusion,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10404.815s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If this proposal were to go through, you're taking $74,000 a year out of this Medford School Department education budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10413.077s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's bad enough now for them to work on a daily basis without having enough of the money that should be in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10419.558s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now you're gonna take another $74,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10421.339s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you know, where does that go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10424.379s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How do you explain that to the Medford taxpayer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10426.86s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can't explain it to me because I wouldn't buy it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10429.921s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because right now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10431.596s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The Medford School Committee is working with all they can do just to maintain their budget and to get by and to start taking more money away to give it to an elected official who does absolutely nothing to enhance or embellish or make better school education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10450.595s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's, it just doesn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10453.296s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if I understand you correctly, I believe you said you would like to have this go and have a decision come up by the end of December of this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10460.479s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe that's what you said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10462.259s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That would be okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10463.4s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But to vote on this tonight, I think it would be wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10466.721s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it would serve no purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10468.622s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I don't think it would be good for Medford public school education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10472.483s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's my opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10473.544s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10506.561s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can I ask a question to the chair?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10507.901s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10508.482s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Did I misunderstand Mrs. Cowell?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10510.283s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Did you say in part of your questioning there is, I think you- She listed a variety of different reforms, rank choice- All right, it was one of the things that you said you wanted illegal aliens to vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10520.887s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Did you say that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10537.305s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10541.468s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm more than happy to answer any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11251.067s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah, just a point of information, just as a notice for this council, I think it was three, maybe five to six years ago, there was a report that came back from the Department of Revenue, Mass Department of Revenue that said, the old school thought was in the council budget, you could only decrease, but that's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11266.959s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can now make appropriations that go the other way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11270.722s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I think it's just something I think you really need to take into consideration as it relates to something that you might see in the budget,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11277.438s">[Robert Penta]</a>: where the old school was that you only could reduce if you wanted to save money, so there would be no way that you could transfer that money to another section, but that's not true because now you can look at certain sections within your budget as it relates to appropriating for or making something less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11294.267s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think that would be very key, so let's stick to your, Councilor Collins' comment as it relates to this could be a beginning step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11304.192s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If it's going to be a beginning step,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11306.753s">[Robert Penta]</a>: it should be a step that parallels every single municipal employee from step one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11311.897s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Some school teachers, I believe, have 10 steps before they get to the top, but an elected official has no steps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11319.082s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's never been that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11319.802s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if you're going to put everybody into the same genre, so to speak, well then maybe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11325.786s">[Robert Penta]</a>: An elected person can maybe have five or six steps, whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11328.849s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Don't forget, one of the real benefits of an elected official is if you serve for 10 years or more, you get a pension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11336.236s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You get a pension from here, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11338.999s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There are some cities and towns that don't offer pensions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11342.478s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So besides the salary, you're also getting the benefit of a pension with a minimum of 10 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11349.283s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I think that really needs to be taken into consideration when you're talking about pay scales and pay raises and whether it be for the council or the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11357.682s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And one of the things that seemed to be a juggernaut in the school and the municipal side is just that particular issue, whether it's in the fire or the police department when they're in their pension areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11368.813s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So it's really something that serves you folks with a good benefit, school department issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11376.064s">[Robert Penta]</a>: school committee person, same thing as a city councilor, but you really, you just don't want to throw that aside without realizing that you're getting a benefit that a lot of cities and towns do not offer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11389.536s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So just thought I'd let you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4111.271s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I have a two-page statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4113.992s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., a former member of this August party on the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4120.255s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 71, Section 52, does grant to the City Council, by a majority vote and by the city charter, the responsibility of how much members of the school committee get paid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4132.02s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But historically, the city council has paid more than the city school committee because the council's responsibilities exceed those of the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4139.885s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The city council responsibilities include, but are not limited to enacting ordinances, zoning, fire and police, public safety requirements, setting the city's tax rate, and has the final authority over the city and school department budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4153.895s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As examples of major differences between one challenging equal pay for equal work between the city council and the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4162.38s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Further, just as in any business, job responsibilities and pay are what one is applying for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4168.324s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Under this proposal, it is a gender attack being disguised as pay parity, for equal pay for equal work, for which it is not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4176.008s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The proposed school department 100% plus pay increase will be paid from the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4181.952s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let's take a look at what that means.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4184.233s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Annually, we are barely able to meet the resources we have now at our school's disposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4190.282s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If we cut further any of our school resources by not funding them, and instead giving them 100% plus salary increase for school committee members, we should be concerned as to where we are heading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4201.477s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If we are to cut some $90,000, because that's what it'll come to, plus each year from going forward from the school department budget, the results can possibly affect the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4211.306s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Fewer instructional hours for students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4213.748s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Elimination of AP classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4215.89s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Increased class sizes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4217.531s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Elimination of some athletic programming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4219.853s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Elimination of support for some school activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4222.736s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Elimination of school librarians.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4226.486s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think the rules say five minutes if you check the council rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4229.429s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Reductions in council services, school security being at risk, reduced custodial cleaning and maintenance, after school programming, migrant student education support, and unbeing prepared for migrant student educational support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4244.904s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I meant the public schools short and long range term should not be subject to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4249.387s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if the school committee pay increase does go through, what do you say about the salary for the everyday school paraprofessionals?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4257.051s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As example, every class assistant under five years would finally earn $30,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4261.593s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And everyday kindergarten teachers after five years would only earn $25,980.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4268.462s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This after five years, while the school committee would receive $29,000 annually for a part time job with no everyday reporting requirements and responsibilities is at best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4280.952s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If the city council is to accept this ridiculous proposal, maybe the council should then set a pay scale standard for both the city council and the school committee for years of service as compared to pay scales a standard for just every other municipal employee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4296.577s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Using the presently proposed gender issue of females being more in number who are elected to serve is not only discriminatory, but a sexist allegation that has no merit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4309.824s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what about a person who claims to be other?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4313.525s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what about when trends tend to go back to when men become more elected than women?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4319.048s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Being elected is a gender neutral opportunity, not to be disguised as pay parity for equal pay for equal work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4326.555s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As I said in the beginning, job responsibilities and pay are the guidelines for which one is applying for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4333.001s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As of this meeting, there has been no input from community members on the Medford School Committee regarding this 100 plus salary increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4343.69s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As a thought, and this flows right into what you said Councilor Scarpelli, if the council is so inclined to accept this measure of allowing this red herring issue of more females than males being elected officials, then maybe in the spirit of physical conservatism and the council being magnanimous, the council should entertain<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4363.806s">[Robert Penta]</a>: being paid the same $12,000, as we said before, annual salary that the school committee is currently paid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4370.447s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Therefore, on the city side, if the city can save $90,000 annually from their city council salary, which can be used for municipal needs, the school department, one sentence, the school department will not lose the $90,000 annually that can go to public school education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4391.072s">[Robert Penta]</a>: One sentence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4395.627s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I wanna close by saying my following sentence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4398.168s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Penta, Mr. Penta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4400.108s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4401.609s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why, hey, wait a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4408.691s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let me ask you a serious question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4411.432s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I served on this board for 36 years, and we stayed here sometimes till 12 and one o'clock in the morning to let everybody speak, not to be shut off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4428.009s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I want to make my last sentence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4429.171s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do you mind?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4430.414s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, I might.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4431.075s">[Robert Penta]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4432.355s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I shall close by saying, why did the city council president put this controversial proposal on the agenda now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4442.0s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Was it because of the busy Christmas season and it being at the end of the year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4446.463s">[Robert Penta]</a>: With the hopes that nobody would observe it and find out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4448.944s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But they did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4449.825s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But they did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=7976.461s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Good question, Robert Pencil, Zero Summit Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=7979.242s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's quite obvious from the comments that have been made here today, whether you're a paraprofessional or you're a full-time employee, you just haven't been treated the correct way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=7988.026s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think it's incumbent, I believe it's incumbent upon one city councilor who will have the guts and take this resolution and say, receive it and place it on file and kill the issue now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8498.316s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of this August party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8503.72s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd like to read a line in the mayor's message today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8509.285s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She wrote, even if we all agree that these additional expenditures on city services are helpful, we need to understand the sacrifices we're asking taxpayers to make and the other pressures they are under.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8524.016s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Sacrifices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8525.858s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Madam Chairperson, you're the perfect example for this, what I wanna say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8530.961s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You recently got married, and when you got married, you- No, I got married six years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8536.285s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay, when you came to Medford, you moved to Medford a few years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8541.848s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Almost 10, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8542.649s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, I don't have an exact number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8548.132s">[Robert Penta]</a>: of what you've got going through right now is the fact that you just have a nice brand new baby, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8552.373s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you're a brand new mother.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8553.934s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's very important for what I wanna say, because there's a cost factor that goes along with all of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8560.436s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a mental factor and it's a financial factor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8563.236s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I'm quite sure you realize what it costs now having a young child, what that entails on a daily basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8569.538s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When we hear the fact right now that there are additional pressures that are gonna be placed on individuals,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8576.297s">[Robert Penta]</a>: whether it's a single family, because that's the only one we heard, it was a single family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8580.258s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We didn't hear about the two family, the three family, the condos, or the apartment dwellers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8585.38s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We didn't hear that, that information hasn't been brought forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8588.201s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it should have been brought forward if you're going to be thorough in this presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8592.203s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when you wanna talk about spending, or controlled spending, you need to talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8598.925s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So as Councilor Knight has alluded to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8602.203s">[Robert Penta]</a>: not thinking this be the right way to go, and I agree with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8605.704s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've never really had, as Councilor Marks alluded to, an outside independent order on every single department that would justify this council going into an administrative decision with the city administration to discuss, we need to now go into a Proposition 2 1⁄2 override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8624.591s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You folks are sitting here tonight with not one city administration here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8629.409s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know if they were asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8631.192s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know if it was intentional for them not to be asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8634.777s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But it would have made a big difference in trying to understand why we are at this stage at 12 and a half.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8642.928s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Two and a half weeks ago, you folks voted at a budget meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8646.855s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At the beginning of the meeting, you voted seven to nothing not to approve the budget, but after the mayor came in and a quarter or two in the morning, you voted seven to nothing for the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8655.263s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So what was asked for and what was gotten all took place between seven o'clock and quarter to in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8661.93s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, is that an exact budget science?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8663.972s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8665.69s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is that the right way to go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8667.331s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a proposition here tonight being proposed to $12 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8670.874s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where is the statistical information?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8673.576s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where are the reports?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8675.438s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where are the reports from the school department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8677.539s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Not one school committee person is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8679.701s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Not one school administration person is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8682.063s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The superintendent should be here if she thought she was gonna be so lucky to get almost $6 million out of a $12 million proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8689.369s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then we go on the city side,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8691.31s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8692.23s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have seven unions in this community, but there only seems to be two that have been recognized here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8697.052s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And very conveniently, they don't mention the Veterans Affairs Office, the veterans in this community who paid who paid through their lives for us to be here and give our commentary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8712.157s">[Robert Penta]</a>: To be exact, you need reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8714.658s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the only way you can have a good report is to make sure that you require it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8720.66s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8722.843s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think I heard Councilor, I don't know where he disappeared to it's his resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8727.148s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, Councilor Bears I believe said you know we've been asking for the last seven months and this and that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8733.355s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the mayor hasn't come around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8735.017s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well you know something, who has the greatest power in this city to control the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8740.987s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's the Medford City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8743.069s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what you also can do at any one given time, whatever that mayor, he or she wants, this council can vote against it until you guys and girls get what you want and what you ask for, because that's the way the game is played.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8757.18s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'll help you if you help me, but if you're not gonna help me and you just go along and you vote for it, well, you're just as much<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8764.805s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just as much to blame think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8767.046s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've allowed these budgets to go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8769.466s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you know they knew this was going on, and you did nothing about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8773.787s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you started in January asking for these financial reports and you didn't get them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8778.669s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then you should have stopped anything that came from the mayor's office, looking for approval until you got your reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8784.47s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Your responsibility and for the city is to run its financial management, and when you have intermittent and you don't have administrators in this building that can come forward to explain what 12 and a half million dollars will do more than $550 on a single family home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8801.693s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You got the doubles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8802.713s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What about the commercial piece of people property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8805.394s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You haven't even discussed them, and in the following years they keep going after two and a half automatically goes up each and every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8811.975s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's something to really think about, because this is not chump change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8815.776s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This isn't $1, $2, or $3 million that you probably could find if you went through that budget and you cut through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8822.258s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is $12 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8824.439s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And who come up with the $12 million?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8826.9s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Two Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8828.74s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Two Councilors who don't even pay real estate tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8831.441s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They don't understand the value.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8853.836s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm gonna continue what I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8855.277s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you understood, if you paid real estate tax, you would understand the impact that this would.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8904.473s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, you maybe missed my point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8906.634s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My point was this, not owning the real estate and having to pay those additional taxes, that gets itself disseminated down to you as a renter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8914.936s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if you, as a renter, are gonna pay the difference in the increase, but you're putting the burden back onto the who.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8920.578s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if she has a tax, if she's paying a rental tax,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8924.019s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that she can afford right now, maybe about a two or $300 a month increase, she won't be able to and that's what we're talking about people on fixed incomes, seniors on fixed income.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8934.005s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when you hear the story, when you're watching on television, every dollar counts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8938.127s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it going to be for my medicine?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8939.708s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it going to be for my where I'm living?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8941.949s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it going to be to put gas in my car?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8943.71s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it going to be for food?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8945.091s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it going to be that I can't go out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8946.532s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I got to stay home?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8948.153s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what we're dealing with right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8949.435s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're dealing with an economic impact in this country that's affecting everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8953.32s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that $12 million will kill this city of Medford because the city of Medford will never recover from something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8960.65s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you vote for that, you're going to...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8963.333s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you vote for that $12 million, you're going to take away what Medford is all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8968.536s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor Knight was absolutely right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8970.777s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Sit down, have a discussion, go over the whole thing, and ask for an independent outside audit to address all these departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8978.942s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what you need to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8983.224s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, we're too good of a city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8984.965s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We are way too good of a city to let something like this happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8989.552s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We've sat here for years with former Councilors and myself, and we never, never experienced anything that was presented in the middle of the night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9000.559s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what July is, it's the heat of the night, it's hot out, it's almost 90 degrees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9006.413s">[Robert Penta]</a>: where the people that this hall should be full of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9009.617s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's not because as Councilman alluded to, there was an issue way back a couple of two or three years ago in Mystic Avenue in the month of August when they had a public hearing and all the people showed up and they got so scared as to what's going on, they canceled the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9022.412s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And after they canceled the meeting, they took the vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9024.835s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No way should this happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9026.757s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let me just leave you with this last thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9029.499s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Your own Rule 19 on the Medford City Council states that the Medford City Council shall not approve of any bond or expenditure that does not have a written explanation of such expenditure at least seven days prior to said vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9044.229s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You got this three to four days prior to today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9047.652s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not seven days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9049.353s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You cannot even vote on this tonight because your own rules say it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9053.676s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And your own rules also state<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9057.012s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The following any financial paper appearing on the council agenda for the first time, shall be automatically laid on the table for one week when such action is requested by any one member, I'm quite sure there was at least one number here willing to put that on the table unless they have another motion to go by, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9075.965s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I didn't mean to get to an argument with you and I wasn't trying to be right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9078.546s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I was just trying to compliment you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9079.607s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I got my day years mixed up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9081.528s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The fact of the matter is I look at individuals today and I say to myself, how do they afford seven $800,000 houses?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9090.712s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How do they afford when they have two cars and they have kids running all over?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9093.833s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe you must be maxed out to the answer degree in debt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9098.447s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We never did that growing up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9099.848s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We worked for everything we got and we went along as we went.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9103.452s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is huge, $12 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9106.315s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This isn't $1 million or even two that maybe you can figure out how to massage your budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9112.521s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't work that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9114.86s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to be good Councilors, dismiss this action right now, move yourself into a committee to meet with department heads, hire an outside independent auditor to come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9126.406s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you could spend, as Councilor Knight said, $300,000 for an outside law firm that should be doing exactly what this law firm and the city of Medford is paying for, there is something wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9139.013s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5456.479s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Panto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5457.54s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I live at Zero Summit Road, a former member of this August body for 36 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5462.958s">[Robert Penta]</a>: For the past 82 years in the city of Medford, you folks have had weekly council meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5469.04s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I've served under both a plan A and a plan E form of government, and they held steadfast, not only to their weekly meetings, they held steadfast that this microphone, this podium right here was the people's voice on a weekly basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5485.506s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We've gone through the years, situations,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5489.849s">[Robert Penta]</a>: in the Wellington area, whereas if you were on every other week situation, the rat problem that took effect a few years ago, would have never got itself involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5500.758s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then Councilor Caraviello, Councilor Knight can remember people coming from the Morrison Ave Park area regarding in the wintertime storms that took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5509.846s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if the people had to wait every other week to come down here, their problems would have been exacerbated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5516.12s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You talked about making decisions as you relate of committee meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5520.842s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If committee meetings are a result of what takes place here at a city council meeting and forwarded to a committee, and the committee does whatever it's work has to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5530.386s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It still has to come back before the council, but it initiated itself right here in the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5535.848s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Tonight was a perfect example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5538.069s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When the gentleman from the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5540.555s">[Robert Penta]</a>: front porch came down here and unfortunately all the papers weren't in order until the clerk went downstairs to get the papers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5548.878s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, if the papers were not there, he would have had to wait two weeks if this process of two weeks took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5554.72s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That would have been a financial burdensome on that individual through no fault of his own because his papers were filed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5561.002s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when the chairperson got the papers and he saw they weren't filed and they were signed off properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5566.744s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When all of you folks ran for office like myself, I knew it was on a Tuesday night and I also knew that no matter what the day and the week was, was immaterial to the job and my responsibility to do the job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5581.018s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, if you folks wanna go to every other week with 18 committees that you have set up, and of those 18 committees, if you decide you wanna have three or four of them or five of them on every other week, and some of you are on the same committees, how is that gonna work during the same time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5597.304s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's just impossible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5599.645s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Right now, you can meet anywhere, as Councilor Scarpelli alluded to, you can go Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and you're meeting every week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5606.773s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This podium is here for one particular reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5609.875s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is the safeguard that a taxpaying citizen has to come here without having to wait, geez, I gotta wait two weeks because the pressing need is happening right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5620.923s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You folks are getting paid $30,000 a year to do this job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5625.807s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you know what the time commitment was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5627.789s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you also know what the dollar amount was to the salary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5631.444s">[Robert Penta]</a>: God forbid, if you ever go to every other week, you want to come in here and ask for a pay raise, you really will be adding insult to injury.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5638.588s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because that's just something that will never pass the muster of why you folks got elected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5644.332s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You got elected to do one thing, to represent the people the best way you could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5649.755s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And right now for 82 years it's been every Tuesday night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5653.336s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now Councilor Caraviello says change is good, but all change at all times is not good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5660.197s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The lack of community input to every other meeting, the lack of a community input as it relates to why are we making this change?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5667.979s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have two brand new city councils that just came on this term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5671.92s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm quite sure when they were running for office, this was not an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5675.861s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And since it wasn't an issue then, why is it an issue now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5680.222s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Second of all, when you go into the meetings, you talk about the regular meetings of the city council shall be held every two weeks on Tuesday evening at 7pm, beginning the first Tuesday in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5694.507s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then in the last sentence, it turns around and says the following bit further resolve that these updates become effective on September 1 2022.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5704.742s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So what is it, September 1st or is it January 1st of 2023?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5708.263s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's a mix of words there, something is wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5714.364s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also you talk about here, an emergency meeting shall take place unless immediately undelayed action is deemed to be imperative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5725.687s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, just think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5727.267s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Does any one of you know right now what an immediate action could be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5731.588s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What an emergency could be in somebody's life?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5734.705s">[Robert Penta]</a>: or some business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5737.867s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Pardon me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5739.928s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Does anybody know what an emergency could be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5742.229s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't, and neither one of us know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5750.274s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm talking about the community interest for this to make this change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5774.743s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You presented on the agenda for this evening, the word meetings, and this is a result of the change that took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5780.207s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So is it January 1st or is it September 1st?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5783.13s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What's it going to be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5785.431s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if it's September 1st, then it does not become operative January 1st, but that's not the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5835.017s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, it doesn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5835.557s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It says in the bottom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5836.797s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah, September 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5841.978s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think this is no devil coming from the sky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5852.298s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5854.1s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The fact of the matter is simply this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5856.141s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The reason why we're here on a Tuesday night is whether, like last week, you folks only met for maybe 30, 35 minutes, and you've had a pretty easy go from January till now, but once the budget comes in and things start to pick up, okay, so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5868.012s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But imagine if you had it every other week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5870.474s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And once the budget takes place and you start to get into every other week, and you're here four, five, six hours, and then you're going to put a time limit on because you're incapable of probably making an intelligent decision because it's kind of like late night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5884.042s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why do you want to disturb something that has worked?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5887.664s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And more importantly, if you felt such a need for this, and if this council was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5894.488s">[Robert Penta]</a>: so engrossed in the fact that we had to change this, then why don't you just make it effective beginning September of the next election?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5901.572s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why would you do it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5902.352s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It wasn't even an election issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5903.993s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So how did this become an issue right now, less than six months into the term?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5928.783s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I understand that, but it's been while it's been, it's not like it didn't come out of the, it came out of the blue, but while it's been discussed, it never got passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5940.889s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the question is to the metric citizenry who are watching this, they're going to have to figure out, they only can come here every other week, but at the same time, at the same time, you have 18 committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5950.154s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So are we going to say between the first week and the beginning of the second week, these 18 committees are going to work and your committee, the holes are going to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5958.512s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, is that going to make any kind of sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5961.055s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's 18 committees and there's only seven of you, and many of you are on the same committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5965.861s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, so how do you, how do you go through this, this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5991.247s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know what I mean, it's the only place for a public forum, you've got your opinion, I have a forum on what it's a public forum for someone to come and speak on whatever the issue might be, it might be a neighborhood issue that doesn't find itself on the agenda, it might be an emergency that doesn't find itself on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6016.653s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have your opinion, I have mine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6018.534s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As far as that goes, Madam President, I said what I had to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6021.816s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just feel, like I said, it's been 82 years, it's operated under plan E, plan A. It's been every Tuesday night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6029.38s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You never really know what the situation might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6031.482s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when you got elected, you knew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6033.283s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You knew when you got elected, the meetings were going to be every Tuesday night and subcommittees were whenever they're going to take you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6039.066s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And why should time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6041.047s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why should time even be an issue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6043.089s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Whether you meet one night a week or whether you meet four times a week, that's what you got elected for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6047.732s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And whatever the issues are, they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6053.556s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, being elected never bothered me to go to a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6059.175s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if it was every week, I went every week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6061.976s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If it was two or three times a week, we would meet two or three times a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6065.657s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And let me just conclude by saying the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6068.078s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If in fact, this council feels that they now want to change to every other week, please do not put anything on the agenda that asks for pay raise, because you would really be insulting the people of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6087.545s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, that's not what I said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6089.486s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What I said is if you're going to make this vote to go to every other week, please don't come back and vote in support of a pay raise for yourself, because then $30,000 for every other week becomes overpaid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6102.47s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as Councilor Caraviello alluded to, when he made his comments two weeks ago, if you go to every other week, maybe you should reduce your salary from 30 to 15,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6109.813s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6975.109s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm Robert Pentezero, Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6977.41s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe a couple of weeks ago, this council passed two resolutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6980.693s">[Robert Penta]</a>: One was a million dollars for new sidewalks, and I believe the second one was for $250,000 to remove tree stumps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6987.497s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But there was no identification of where the sidewalks were going to go over and beyond money for new panels, and there was no identification as to what tree stumps were going to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6997.404s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, over the past few years, here in Medford, former public works director had one,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7003.688s">[Robert Penta]</a>: two types of lists, one for tree stumps, and one for sidewalks, but unfortunately when the council passed at this time nobody asked that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7011.173s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So as a citizen, the council did ask, they asked a question of where they're going to be located, the tree stumps, and the sidewalk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7018.778s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So is there any way that that could be made a public disclosure, either on this, we don't have any city newspaper anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7025.623s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So method patch, or in the city web page could that go on there as soon as we get it, we can put it in, we have a dry folder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7033.088s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Madam President, you say as soon as you get I understand that but you should have had it the night that you took the vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7051.887s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But, but is there a list right now that it is available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7063.536s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So then just a very simple question, not to beg the issue, but maybe it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7067.498s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, you get something to vote on, especially tree stumps, much more than sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7073.803s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Those locations should have identified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7075.484s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is the third time something like this has been presented to the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7079.207s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So did you get the first two lists?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7083.51s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, have any of these lists<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7086.187s">[Robert Penta]</a>: tree stumps from the first of the second list even been taken care of some of them with duplicates especially on sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7091.488s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's just a thought because some residents are saying a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7094.149s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's a lot of money for sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7128.295s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it possible, Madam President, you can just secure a list for both?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7139.461s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7139.741s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7140.301s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2928.951s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2930.907s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Pinter, Zero Summit Road, mentioned NASS, former member of this August board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2935.029s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let me just tell you something right up front.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2937.91s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I spent 36 years behind this rail, and I never once denied anyone the ability or the action to come before the board and say whatever they thought was important to them, because this is their house, not your house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2953.036s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2956.065s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number two, Council Mark is only asking them to denounce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2959.509s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That sends the message citywide, anyone who might be watching, reporting or what have you, that we're not going to tolerate this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2968.859s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It makes absolutely no sense at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2972.102s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And let's get to the real major thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2974.863s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Vice President, you talk about how many more times are you going to do it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2978.745s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, this all started when the mayor of this community sent a message down to this council to say that the city of Medford was systematically racist, and you folks voted for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2990.43s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you've already been in, you're already in this, you're already in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3001.537s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, I mean, what's kind of an idiotic remark is that we're talking about how this thing, how this thing all generated itself, you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3011.182s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if Mr. Beers wants to have a debate any day of the week on this particular issue, I am quite sure, I'm quite sure he can be accommodated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3022.367s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He's a Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3023.348s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He's an elected official of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3025.27s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's who he is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3026.111s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's what his responsibility is, not just to move on and let's get to the next subject matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3032.497s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Listen to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3033.478s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're talking about human beings out here who for the past year have gone through a life and altering<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3041.595s">[Robert Penta]</a>: whether it's their business, whether it's their family, whether it's their kids, or what have you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3046.398s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The city has never been subjected to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3048.819s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the cowards, and that's what they are, the cowards who are behind that racist amendment, let them come forward, take their position, and stand their ground like a man or a woman, rather than go in the cubby hole, and I'm gonna just keep throwing these bombs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3066.263s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor Marks, you hit it right in the head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3069.045s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The whole idea of what this thing here tonight was, people have gotten frustrated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3074.188s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No matter what the outcome is with the investigation, which is now criminal, that in and of itself ought to tell you something's going on, and I hope our police department, and I hope our police department does find it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3087.816s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, everybody tonight has kept mentioning, you know, the mayor's comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3091.098s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The mayor's comments were written on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3096.024s">[Robert Penta]</a>: July 17th regarding the July 15th rally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3099.347s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She wrote them on July 17.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3101.369s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what she said on that, and that's the reason why they're here, and they're rightfully to be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3106.153s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They talk about that the attendees used language that was disgusting, abhorrent, and it has no place here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3113.556s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, can somebody please come up here and tell me what was said by any one of the 30 people now recognized?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3120.922s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because they stood there in behalf of, they stood there, they didn't even speak, they stood there in behalf of our Metro Police Department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3128.968s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The people are right there every day defending us and taking care of the needs of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3135.544s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why would you want to turn a blind eye to that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3138.125s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's ridiculous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3139.965s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Fire department, school department, teachers, first responders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3145.407s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This Medford City Council has an obligation, whether they like it or whether you don't like it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3151.545s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is wrong what's going on in this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3153.848s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you allow this to continue going on each and every day, and you allow these anonymous cowardly people to do what they're doing, we won't have a city anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3162.597s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because the divisiveness will cause physical anxiety between people, and no one will ever get along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3168.223s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you'll never see the right time of day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3170.165s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The city of Medford will no longer exist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3172.728s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's what we don't want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3173.908s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What you do want is inclusiveness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3175.929s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You want people to be able to sit and to talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3178.429s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a difference of opinion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3179.809s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay, you discuss it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3181.53s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you don't go and sneak around like in the middle of the night like a thief and you put something out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3187.811s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Social media is public media.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3190.171s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not private.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3191.671s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's so public it gives you an opportunity to respond, whether you're on Facebook, Instagram, or whatever you want to call it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3198.653s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3200.073s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would respectfully request and hopefully that every member of this council takes its position, lets the entire city of Medford know what their positions are, because let me tell you something, this is an immediate election coming up, and it's gonna reflect badly on anyone who decides that they're afraid to take a position, because they're gonna wait for the decision from the criminal court to come back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3221.629s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let me tell you something, if it was any one of you folks, and it was your name that was on there,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3226.553s">[Robert Penta]</a>: you'd see you'd be acting a little bit different because you wouldn't want it to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3230.555s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It started in this building, it started over there, it came over here, and this council voted for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3236.137s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when you voted for it, you accepted the responsibility that went with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3240.679s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why should any citizen who had nothing to do with anything<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3245.841s">[Robert Penta]</a>: be held accountable for something they have no control over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3248.902s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just don't know where to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3251.983s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I am so upset with this right now, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3254.024s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I cannot believe that this Medford City Council is toying with this as to whether to vote for it or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3260.127s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's as obvious and as clear as can be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3262.768s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do your job, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3264.088s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=463.132s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Good evening, my name is Bob Penta, Zero Summit Road, former member of the Sarkis party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=467.496s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would respectfully disagree with using the word concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=470.279s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The fact of the matter is that an accident has already taken place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=472.921s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Tank has already been going down that road and coming up that road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=476.184s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have MBTA buses telling you, you have a line from your own traffic consultant that tells you that a fire truck, if has to, can go on the opposite lane.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=486.073s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have no idea at what time of day or night that that might be happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=489.436s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The whole idea, I believe, the impetus of the council president's resolution is to let this city administration know that this council is not supportive of this type of islands coming in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=503.304s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can call it part of the complete streets program, the $563,000 that the city got from the commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=509.888s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where was the fire chief being consulted on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=512.33s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where was the city engineer being consulted?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=514.251s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And all these proposed bump outs that are being planned right now, continuing down on High Street, going into the West Medford area, where's the consultation for that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=523.599s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just go look at Sagamore Avenue and see the way they want to have that cutout coming out into the middle of High Street and then Boston Avenue over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=531.064s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then further down, right opposite the Brooks School, there's a gentleman who just did his driveway over and he's got a bump out in front of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=536.308s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't make any sense at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=538.49s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would not change one word in the president's resolution, only for one reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=542.311s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The city administration has to know that you do recognize that this is a safety problem here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=548.192s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This isn't just for cars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=549.753s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is for trucks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=550.873s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is for ambulances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=552.273s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is for other kinds of vehicles that are heavy duty going down there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=556.334s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we're not talking about a good day, as the council just alluded to on Sunday at 9 o'clock in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=561.795s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The gentleman, unfortunately, didn't see the island.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=564.376s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Not only didn't see the island, he wrecked the whole bottom of the carriage of his car.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=568.738s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What are you going to do in a snowstorm when it's dark out late at night and you have a big heavy tanker going down there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=575.046s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What are you going to do with a bicycle, a gentleman or a lady driving their bike down there, going in that little lane there, and you have an emergency vehicle trying to get by?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=585.42s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, one thing I learned after many years of being on this council is one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=590.962s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you know you see something that's wrong, why would you want to just smooth it over, use the word of concern as relates to telling the city administration, you're going to continue on with this complete streets program, this traffic calming issue, then the public safety is the priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=608.887s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And right now it's quite obvious that it's not a priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=611.547s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Correct me if I'm wrong, Council President,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=613.828s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Fire Chief said, even though he can get by, he's only got a foot on either side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=617.818s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is that what he said?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=653.904s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would believe that the impetus of the resolution, if you want to get to the concern that Mr. Isaac Beers has introduced, that would be something that they would once again look at to come back, okay, we'll redesign it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=667.652s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you'd lose your impact by putting the city on notice that you've recognized, you've talked, this is four times in a month, you have discussed this issue and it's not going away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=679.152s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the only way it's going to go away is if the city administration is aware of it and whoever their contact is with the state for the purposes of trying to make this correction, so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=688.674s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As of this Sunday, the fire chief, as of this Sunday, the fire chief still hasn't been informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=693.175s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So he had to go out there and do his dry run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=695.555s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, how do you call that progress?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=697.916s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How do you call that when somebody is supposed to sit down and let's talk about this traffic calming issue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=703.837s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How can it be traffic calming when you haven't even spoken to the public safety personnel who it's going to affect?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=710.559s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, it isn't like you guys, young lady, are in a tough bind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=716.882s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a very simple resolution that the President has offered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=723.225s">[Robert Penta]</a>: as the mayor of this community and to your departments, we're putting you on notice because God forbid something happens and somebody gets killed, this council has put the city on notice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=733.328s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If not, God forbid something happens and you modify that resolution, you're all gonna be part of a lawsuit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=740.93s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then you're gonna have to explain your way out of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=743.651s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's wrong and that shouldn't happen like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=747.454s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would suggest, Mr. President, that you do not accept the resolution to modify it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=752.939s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just make it as a concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=754.02s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not a concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=755.001s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=755.842s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a public safety issue that demands its attention one way or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=760.987s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if they don't want to resolve it, shame on them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=763.129s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At least the council's on record explaining the reason why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=766.172s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=768.034s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=770.837s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1163.281s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just in response to Council max.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1165.983s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Nobody's asking anything to be redesigned I don't think any of us have that expertise we're aware of that, but nobody came into the city and sat down with the public safety people, as it relates to all these locations that are being promulgated, and whether a review after four months<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1182.35s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, after four weeks talking about this and there's still, there is still no communication with the public safety personnel of this city, which means either one or two things, either the city administration is not listening to the council, the city engineers not listening to the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1197.512s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you have a fire chief who's basically telling you, you might have a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1201.414s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a city traffic engineer turns around and tells you, well, if something happens, you can go to the opposite side of the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1207.537s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, that in and of itself tells you right there, don't talk about public safety when you have a fire truck coming at you on the opposite side of the street, if an emergency exists, or if there's a snowstorm or whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1219.06s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The whole idea I believe of the impotence of this whole resolution is to put the city on notice that you're not happy with the island there because it is, it has the potential to cause problems and if it's going to cause problems in an accident for which you've already had one it's already started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1233.951s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, keep us out of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1235.793s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We should not be part of any lawsuit by any citizen, city of Medford or other city of Medford, because we told you this was going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1243.402s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe it might be wise, Mr. President, to invite the state in to sit down with the city council and review every one of these locations that they want to put in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1252.032s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How many accidents have taken place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1253.833s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is the reason why we're putting it here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1255.774s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where the bump boats are going and what's the reason for it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1258.695s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They made the determination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1260.236s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They don't live in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1262.016s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're not the experts for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1265.118s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's our city engineer and our public safety because if it's going to impede anything that they do on a daily basis, they should be primary before any decision is made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1275.623s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5772.241s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, former member of the circus party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5778.526s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd like to read a three-page prepared commentary<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5783.65s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that I find and feel to be very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5787.011s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a message from Memorial Day to Flag Day, and it's a commentary to our Medford residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5793.653s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Memorial Day, why is my speakers off?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5799.655s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Memorial Day was never intended as a celebration to remind us of the ugliness and the ravages of war, but rather to honor in some solemn observance, our men and women,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5812.54s">[Robert Penta]</a>: their survivors, and our allied comrades who sacrificed their lives to protect our liberty and our freedoms here at home and around the world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5823.785s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Likewise, our Flag Day observance on June 14th is but an annual reminder of some 244 years ago when the Second Continental Congress, along with George Washington, took a break from their writing of the Articles of Confederation to establish a standard bearer<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5842.382s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to be the unifying symbol of our colonial fighting forces and for our freedom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5850.245s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As our fledgling nation was moving forward in its quest for its independence, that is how Old Glory was commissioned to be our American flag.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5861.143s">[Robert Penta]</a>: From Memorial Day remembrances of lives given up to protect our America, to the flag day birth of old glory, both symbolizing the embodiment of our right of free speech, we are here today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5876.69s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But in the interim of many years, what has happened to our country, state, and local cities and towns nationwide, especially over the past 30 years in particular?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5890.537s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When the politically correct crowd of progressives and liberals began complaining that our public displays of patriotism is offensive to others, and we have to back off such displays, and that we are a systematically racist country as well as a city, and that we need to practice cancel culture, wokeness, defund the police, teach systematic race theory, and being a white supremacist,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5919.918s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and accept revisionary history as history's new truth, I take offense to such broad universal commentaries, especially by Washington politicians and self-serving proclaimed educators who have made their living by espousing race as their financial and social calling card for more than the past 20 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5946.933s">[Robert Penta]</a>: With crime running at an all time high, illegal immigration crossing our borders, causing ongoing social welfare, educational, security, and uncontrollable medical problems, we have now become the victims of today's liberal and progressives agenda of inclusion without requirement or responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5973.209s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, if God offends anyone, then I suggest you consider another part of the world as your new home, because our good God is part of our American inheritance of religious freedoms secure from governmental intervention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5989.062s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if our American stars and stripes offend you, or you do not like or believe in our Uncle Sam, and you don't have the tolerance for free speech, then you should seriously consider exporting yourself to another country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6004.392s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In conclusion,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6006.095s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Our First Amendment gives every citizen the right to express his or her opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6011.277s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But for those who complain, whine, or gripe, or dislike our American way of life, as well as our city of Medford way of life, don't let the door slam you as you leave, because you do have the right and the opportunity to leave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6030.162s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We are not a perfect society.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6033.805s">[Robert Penta]</a>: but there is no other country that offers more freedoms than our America.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6039.968s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So from a Memorial Day remembrance to a Flag Day observation, let not our freedom of thought, speech, and expression ever be challenged by some ideology that bears no fruit but hatred, division, and racism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6059.422s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you and let our method never be a part of any such movement or agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6066.267s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I felt Mr. President and Councilors, I had to say that because after being at the Memorial Day service and listening to our veterans director emotionally present before our community that for which a veteran is all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6087.122s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I feel as an American.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6091.823s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I am a white Italian American.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6095.306s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm proud of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6096.767s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I am not a racist, and I don't intend to be a racist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6101.191s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I encompass anyone and everyone who wishes to express their opinion, and I would hope that our city of Medford does not go down any path that disrespects the fact of who we are as individuals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6115.943s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8028.474s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Penton, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8031.136s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I have some, Mr. President, this is our third time we've had this discussion on this high street project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8035.527s">[Robert Penta]</a>: at the corner of Woobin and Hastings Lane.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8039.609s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I'm a little bit disturbed and recognizing that Mr. Blake, who I've never met, I'm quite sure that he's proficient in what he does, but he makes a comment in his response to you by saying fire trucks may have to use the entire opposite lane to make the turns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8057.819s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And by doing that, Mr. President, what you are doing, you are exposing the city of Medford to a tremendous amount of liability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8066.106s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if the city is going to go forward and leave that island there, then it should be part of the official record here that the Medford City Council does not support, but rather condones the fact that that island can now cause a potential hazard to the city of Medford's liability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8087.682s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We've spoken to MBTA buses, there's no mention in here on the extra long tankers that carry gas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8094.305s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The other day coming down high street toward the charter circle, there was a bicyclist there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8101.329s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you know those trucks once they have that weight, they're moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8105.631s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he was people in the home because the bike was just taking his time going through that little pathway there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8112.254s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So all I can say is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8114.752s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's there, it's in writing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8116.914s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the city council now has enough, if you're really strong in this position, and I think you are, you have an affirmative position to make by way of a vote that the city of Medford, the Medford city council opposes that particular island that's put there because the acknowledgement from your own traffic commissioner says,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8135.872s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The fire trucks might have to go on the complete opposite lane to make its turn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8140.835s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What about a car coming the opposite way?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8143.377s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What about the bump out that's over there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8145.058s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What about the second island?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8147.18s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What about the bump out that's in front of the house, in front of the man's driveway, in front of the Brooks School?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8153.804s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It makes no sense at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8155.925s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And go further down into West Method on the corner of High Street and Sagamore Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8160.789s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Look what they already have penciled out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8163.571s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's on to the middle of the street almost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8166.353s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These aren't traffic calming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8168.174s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are traffic accidents just waiting to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8171.115s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you've got to understand the route traffic and the type of traffic that's on those routes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8175.958s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think you brought it up last week, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8178.339s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A truck going up the hill, they've got to pick up the speed to get up the hill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8181.86s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Look at the buses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8182.741s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What are you going to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8184.282s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And right there at that intersection, there's a bump out there, which makes further no sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8189.904s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I don't know, Mr. Blake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8191.485s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Like I said, I've never met you and I don't know you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8194.487s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I don't know how you can put in writing that a firetruck can go in the opposite lane to make its turn if it has to because of an emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8203.774s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You are now indicating that the city is exposing itself to a liability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8209.659s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if that's what the state is going to be doing throughout the rest of the city, with these locations, with these prompts, causing problems with side streets because of buses,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8220.885s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and cars cannot be going down there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8222.728s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What are we getting all this money for the state for if the city has no input into providing common sense use of the money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8233.145s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a damn shame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8234.899s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that we have to be discussing, you folks have to be discussing something that common sense tells you by just going there and looking at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8242.545s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you can paint and stripe the streets all you want with your yellow lines, you're not gonna get rid of those islands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8248.249s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you're not going to get rid of the fact that coming up or going down in a winter's day storm, and if there's ice in the road, and if there's an emergency that has to take place, somebody is gonna get killed there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8261.279s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you already have it now in writing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8264.18s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Your traffic supervisor has now told you in writing that a fire truck can go on the opposite lane if he can't make the turn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8272.283s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What does that tell you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8273.423s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What does that tell you about the Commonwealth of Massachusetts coming in here trying to tell the city of Metro, we know what's best for your streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8281.166s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Tell them to take their money back and mind their business and let the city of Metro to its engineering department and through citizen input, take each section one at a time to realize what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8294.052s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's all right for somebody to come in here and tell you what to do, but it isn't all right for you to tell them, possibly you maybe made a mistake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8303.038s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You haven't thought this out correctly or possibly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8306.181s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, you're the president of this council, the six of you, you make seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8310.804s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would strongly, I strongly advise and suggest that some one of you, if not all of you put a resolution on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8318.851s">[Robert Penta]</a>: indicating that you do not, you are against, and you don't accept the fact that that island in the middle of High Street, Reuben, Hastings Lane, serves in the best interest of the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8331.656s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If anything, it does not serve in the best interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8334.897s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you have the letter from your own traffic supervisor who says the same thing, traffic consultant, excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3856.492s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Good evening, name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3857.873s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Bob Penta, former member of the Saugus body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3860.935s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I would be remiss not to come up here because as a prior member of the Smith City Council, I think it was only on three separate occasions that I had the honor of recognizing a young gentleman who became an Eagle Scout.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3873.745s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Tonight, it's a distinct pleasure because in today's day and age, you don't even hear of the term of an Eagle Scout.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3879.029s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't hear about the dedication that a young man would put<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3883.072s">[Robert Penta]</a>: into doing something positive, not only for the community, but for himself, recognizing he needs to be a success for the future because that's what this is all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3893.046s">[Robert Penta]</a>: being self-made and going forward, being a graduate of the vocational school, that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3897.507s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Going into the electrical department, that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3900.048s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Being an electrician, that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3902.389s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the one thing that everyone seems to be missing today about youngsters, whether they're male or females, is the fact that they have this self-worth of wanting to do something that benefits the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3914.512s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And just by looking at him and looking at the six years that it took him and his family that's here, it's a proud moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3921.114s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And not only is it a proud moment, it speaks well for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3925.311s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't hear too much about scouts today in the news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3927.933s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If anything, you may hear some more negative than positive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3930.975s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But this gentleman represents the positive part of what our city is all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3936.039s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It represents why Medford is what it is, because they have the ingredients, the intelligence, and the drive of a good, young, honest man who wants to make not only his life better, but our city of Medford better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3949.57s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So like I said, I would be remiss not to come up here and say that because I think this is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3954.534s">[Robert Penta]</a>: a distinct honor, not only for this gentleman, but also for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3959.317s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6254.491s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass, former member of the Saugus Party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6259.976s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Last week, we had an interesting conversation that you started, Mr. President, regarding this little bit of an island that supposedly has found its way at the corner of Woburn and High Street and Hastings Lane.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6271.898s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I spent some time during this past week, once again, speaking to bus drivers, members of our fire department, as it relates to the question that I believe the council asked, and I don't think any of you ever got the answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6285.262s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Whose idea was it to authorize, to put that file in there, in the middle of the street?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6290.924s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you can just anticipate as bus drivers do, and as a fire truck would do, in an emergency, snowstorm, whatever it might be, just take one of those big,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6300.754s">[Robert Penta]</a>: tankers to deliver gas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6303.175s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in the wintertime, if in fact they happen to be coming down the street and there's some ice or whatever it might be, what about the bike people where the bike lane no longer exists anymore and it's not to be found?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6313.94s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if they ever decide to put that bike lane in the middle of the street in between the two islands that are there, not the single one, the two islands there, you've got a real serious problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6323.344s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So my question to you, Mr. President, is the city engineers still online?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6343.159s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is he still online?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6343.959s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can we ask the question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6345.16s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Um, the traffic engineer is not online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6347.562s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What about the city engineer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6348.863s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm quite sure an engineering plan has to take place to put that in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6354.667s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Unfortunately, he's not online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6356.58s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, they continue to keep going on and doing work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6360.702s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you just take a look at the idea, if in case there's an emergency and a fire truck has to make it down that street and make that left-handed turn in a snowstorm, you have a problem just facing you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6372.008s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've got a bump out coming out there on the corner of Woolman and High Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6376.01s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's just, how do you allow things like this to happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6380.012s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm not saying the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6381.484s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would hope that the council would make a concerted effort to have the city stop that process and actually go out there and look at it, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6391.513s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That path coming down on the corner of Hastings, you've seen it, we've talked about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6397.939s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That thing is so narrow, it's an accident waiting to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6401.323s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And is that what the city has to do, wait for the accident to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6404.706s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Correct it before that even happens, and the island should be as a matter of fact they're keeping both islands there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6412.235s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Whoever comes up with bad enough going down high street toward West Midland right near opposite the Brooks School, there's a bumper right in front of somebody's house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6420.9s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It makes no sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6422.621s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who comes up with these ideas?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6424.523s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, it would be nice if you want to talk about public safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6427.324s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6427.965s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It would be nice to maybe have the council think about it or have them involved with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6432.667s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I don't know if these are state people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6434.389s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know if these are city contractors or if this is the city itself that's doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6438.531s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But between the bump outs and that section right there, right there on the corner of High Street, Hastings Lane and Rubin Street, that is a disaster waiting to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6447.975s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I would hope this council takes an aggressive action and holds the city accountable and not continue further with that and get rid of that island.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6455.719s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It just makes no sense at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6457.279s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You'd have to be a complete moron not to understand coming down High Street, that road is so narrow,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6464.658s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just think of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6466.279s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Both ways, both ways, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6469.08s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Both ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6469.901s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's a shame that none of you have gotten an answer back and you asked for that a week ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6474.442s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Public safety and not even an answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6517.98s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you've got the bumper right over there as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6521.983s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm picking up one other point that Council Marks alluded to, because apparently there's been no updating as to the streets, as the sidewalks being a little bit wider in the bike lane.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6531.65s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So since none of that has taken place, and you have people coming down High Street in that bike lane, they're going to traverse right into that middle of maybe 8 to 10 feet wide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6546.586s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would hope one of you on this council would make a motion to just put a stop in that project to fully have a complete public safety review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6556.934s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's up and it can also be taken down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6610.339s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6611.26s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I thank you for listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6612.543s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I know you've seen it, we've had this discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6615.225s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And again, I would something, hopefully, you know, things are made to be corrected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6619.407s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's why there's a racist on pencils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6620.968s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's why sometimes having something like this really be taken a look at in the interest of public safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6627.111s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it makes a lot of sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6628.652s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6629.172s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1961.812s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, former member of the Saugus body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1965.595s">[Robert Penta]</a>: During this past week, I've had two conversations with two separate bus drivers from the MBTA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1970.44s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And their question is, cause I can't answer it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1972.141s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So since you do have the city engineer online, they think this is a complete hasty comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1978.755s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Safety has it as Councilor Caraviello and a few of you alluded to, to having this island that sticks out on the corner of High Street and Woburn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1986.619s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So since we have the city engineer, could you please answer the question, whose idea was to put that island there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1993.022s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And did that island come in as an afterthought to this construction project?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1996.944s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because if that's the case, then I would strongly suggest that you folks recommend that that be removed before someone gets killed here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2005.405s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can we ask the question, please, to the city engineer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2055.541s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But with that being said, Mr. President, going back to what Councilor Marks and others have alluded to, the bike lane and the taking a property coming up high street and then getting to that intersection going down the hill, that seems to be have bypassed whatever was supposed to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2070.548s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you're asking for something now that this council has already voted on and there's been a change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2076.291s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I get the impression that this council has not been advised of these changes and the bike route.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2082.586s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and the island that went there, because it appears that that island, I mean, you're talking about safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2088.687s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let's talk about the traffic safety before the, you already have a crosswalk right there at the corner of Hastings Lane going across.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2096.069s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the island comes out a little bit more, it comes over in the area that's pushed out where, in front of the other island that's already there, that's gonna be gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2103.11s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you have to take into consideration in the wintertime, buses coming down the street, heavy duty trucks, ambulances that have to get there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2110.652s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're looking at a serious,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2112.587s">[Robert Penta]</a>: vehicular emergency situation that's going to happen there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2116.991s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I would strongly suggest that that island can be removed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2120.555s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It should be removed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5900.88s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5902.181s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, I'm Bob Pento, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5905.126s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Rick just jogged my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5906.887s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The city has in its Department of Public Works, anytime a street is opened by a public utility, there is a bond that they have to place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5914.489s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe it's gone from five to $10,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5917.63s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think what really needs to be checked, if you wanna get into this review as Rick suggested, and he's absolutely right, have those bonds been taken out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5925.393s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is the city sitting on any kind of money in its legal department or the Department of Public Works?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5930.535s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because one of the big complaints before when the streets were being dug up by utilities,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5934.26s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They weren't being put back in the way they were or made better than what they were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5938.122s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And many streets are like that in the city, national grids coming in, they've done that on numerous occasions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5942.844s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So as a result of that, I think it's something that you probably should look into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5946.405s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Have they filed anything by way of a bond with the city as it relates to this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5951.267s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And more importantly, when you talk about the residents not getting their fair share out of this whole thing, Councilor Marx is right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5958.55s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because if in that agreement, in that purchase and whatever you want to call it, that agreement between the city and Eversource, it keeps going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5966.716s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as we know, and I'll ask Councilor Knight, Vice President Knight, if you look at all those additions that they've had since 2015, I guarantee you that the personnel that started this aren't the same personnel that's there right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5980.305s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if that's the case, that's where the city is losing out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5983.186s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So that's why you need it hard and fast right up front when the contract is signed,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5987.714s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Once again, what are they putting up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5989.034s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Are they putting up a million or two million?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5991.035s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Whatever the contingency might be, but you have it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5994.076s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have it already built into the Department of Public Works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5996.737s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When the public utility comes into the city, they have to place a bond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6000.898s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if they don't place the bond, they don't get their money back as it relates to the work that they've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6006.239s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there has to be what they call a performance bond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6008.857s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's the term, performance bond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6010.519s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if that's not in the contract and they are digging up the street and Eversource is in fact utility, then shame on the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6017.245s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if you do have it, then maybe that $10,000 ought to be increased to a million or two because of the magnitude and the scope of the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6024.812s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So thank you, Rick Orlando, you jog my memory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2127.136s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He used to come to these council meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2129.098s">[Robert Penta]</a>: on numerous occasions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2130.139s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if he had an opinion to make, he would make it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2132.94s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he would tell you right to your face what he thought of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2134.881s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's the same way he acted when he was a police officer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2137.983s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If he made an infraction of the law, you were guilty of doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2141.344s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then if he wanted to give you a break, that would be a separate story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2144.326s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the interesting part about Harold is I think he represents what a lot of people try to do to a police officer today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2153.804s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They try to make them look like a bad person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2156.706s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're not out there for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2159.007s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's the worst message you can send out there right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2162.849s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Harold McGillivray was a policeman's policeman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2166.611s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he represents every single policeman that puts that uniform on every day, puts that gun, puts that badge, and goes out there to defend the people of the community that they're in, whether it's city, county, state, or whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2181.099s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would hope that the people of Medford not only appreciate the fact that Harold McGillivray and the family and his two sons, who are also police officers in the city, are going to have their father's name be put on the plaque that represents what law enforcement is in this country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2198.276s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're there to help and defend the people, and that's what it should be about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2203.544s">[Robert Penta]</a>: not to debunk them, but to defend them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2206.407s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's a shame that anyone tries to do anything to take away from the integrity of what a police officer is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2212.933s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And to Mr. Harold McGillivray, I thank him very much because I enjoyed him and he was a good supporter of mine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2218.819s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And because of that, I support him as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2221.041s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6750.182s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6752.482s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm at the NASS, former member of the Sawyer-Gasparti.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6755.643s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I want to, at the outset, I'd like to thank former Councilor Doherty for coming forward because her points of vote are very cogent because Memorial Day is right around the corner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6767.253s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's probably the most sacred of all our veterans holidays during the course of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6774.916s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And for this city to go forward and look for an exemption to eliminate veterans in a police exam preference says an awful lot of things as it relates to where are we going?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6787.602s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, where are we going as a community and as elected officials?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6791.984s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know the real sad part about this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6794.415s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is gonna be the 30th year in Washington, D.C.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6798.697s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that the veterans have had their annual motorcycle parade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6801.939s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's the first time that it's being canceled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6805.321s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's being canceled because allegedly of COVID.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6808.822s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But on the same day, BLM is having their parade and cannabis is having their event on the same day, same times as the schedule for the AMVETS 30th anniversary motorcycle parade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6823.795s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's a little bit of a disconnect here and maybe of a political, where do we go and who is in support of who and whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6830.777s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'll tell you my experience about my free speech being infringed upon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6835.758s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's a group in Method called Method Mass Politics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6839.479s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The issue was the Christopher Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6842.06s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now I expressed my opinion on that page, like I've done on many pages here on the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6848.162s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I've been called every conceivable thing that you can think of on that page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6853.679s">[Robert Penta]</a>: on that group by members in that group and leaving no expert is out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6859.662s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just use your imagination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6862.783s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's free speech.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6865.644s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if they want to say it, and if they're not going to be scolded because of being the appropriateness of their language, then so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6874.108s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I shouldn't be chastised or anyone else be chastised for going on that page or any other page and expressing your opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6881.571s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just like Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6882.092s">[Robert Penta]</a>: D'Antonio said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6883.4s">[Robert Penta]</a>: just like Councilor Doherty said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6885.182s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when you are on a board and a commission of this community, common sense dictates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6891.248s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because that's what you're here for, to listen to both sides of whatever the issue might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6896.293s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Common sense dictates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6897.995s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be working here in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6902.88s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know what I resent the most?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6904.804s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I resent the most when people say, I'm white, I was born privileged, and I have a spoon in my mouth, and I can take advantage of anything, or I have taken advantage of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6916.123s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When I look at all of you, you're all white, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6919.404s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You work for what you got nothing's been handed down to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6923.085s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I resent the fact that anyone would turn around and tell me that I'm a racist because I'm white.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6928.866s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I've been privileged because I'm white because nobody knows my life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6932.507s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Nobody knows my background, how I got to where I am.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6936.228s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And just because I served in government for 39 years, which is the greatest honor I've ever had, outside of being married and having children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6944.289s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No one can take away that feeling of serving the people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6948.743s">[Robert Penta]</a>: but you serve the people not to denigrate the people, you serve them to build them up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6954.187s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when you start to tell little kids today in school, that you've got to be ashamed whether you're white, black, blue or brown, that's wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6962.434s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Don't do that to a little kid in our public school education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6967.258s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm gonna switch gears real quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6969.619s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The city of Medford has just been, I've read in patch today, city of Medford is getting $37,500,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6977.215s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if the city of Medford is getting $37,500,000, as Councilor Marks alluded to earlier on this evening, I guess the better question is, you guys have got a budget coming up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6987.604s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if you have a budget coming up, why should you discuss a budget when you're anticipating under the American Recovery Act, this $37 million, you're gonna get it all at once, you're gonna get it over a year, how are you going to get it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7000.111s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You people should have a committee of the whole meeting with the mayor present to tell you how this money is going to be disseminated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7006.933s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In 2007 and 2009, when this country had its economic problems, the monies that were given out back then couldn't compete against the needs that the communities have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7016.836s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, now it's a little bit different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7019.116s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're getting $37 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7020.717s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a tremendous amount of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7022.937s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you got to look at some of the things that can be used for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7025.859s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And to me, the first question is, it's looming right around the corner from all of you in 2029, you've got an approximately $30 million unfunded pension liability that no one still talks about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7038.248s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who's gonna pay for that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7039.209s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How's it gonna be paid?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7040.33s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it gonna be included in this money that you're going to be getting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7043.733s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are questions you really need to ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7046.054s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, it talks about paying premium pay for the people who did work during the COVID-19.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7054.24s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, how are you going to disseminate that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7055.861s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it going to be first responders?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7057.342s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it going to be fire?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7058.142s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it going to be police?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7059.583s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who's it going to be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7061.284s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think you really need to sit down and have this conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7064.766s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let me ask you, have you people have been notified already that you're getting $37 million or did you just read about it in the paper?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7072.39s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7075.072s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have not received it, but it's okay for transparency, for the patch to have it, but the council not to have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7082.275s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My suggestion strongly to folks, all of you, whether you're sitting here or the two that are sitting home, that you sit down with the mayor and her staff to discuss what that $37,500,000 is all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7095.559s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Point of information, Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7150.169s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Through the chair, Mr. President, it also indicates that you can get premium pay for essential workers and you can offer additional support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7156.493s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you can also, the money can also go into the educational park and the educational park for which a lot of these kids have gone through, they have suffered over the past year for emotional disabilities that kids have been able to suffer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7168.872s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and we won't get it to the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7170.032s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We'll just leave it like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7172.773s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There is money there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7173.794s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's broken down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7174.534s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's six categories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7176.235s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm not gonna go through all six of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7177.435s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm just saying, thank you, Council Vice President Knight, but I think you really need to sit down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7182.257s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And before you take one vote on this budget coming up, you should know exactly how and when that money's coming in and what it can be used for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7189.6s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And just as a third point, let's go back to the money that they wanna use to take the $500,000 out of that retained earnings account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7198.946s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We are well beyond the 10 year, 10 to 12 year minimum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7203.395s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're into almost the 15th year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7205.372s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have batteries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7207.033s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Batteries are not calculating properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7209.055s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's going to reflect on people's bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7210.997s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's going to be, it was 795 abatements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7217.963s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7219.003s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, listen, wait a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7220.204s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're talking about money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7221.165s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're coming close to our 10 minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7222.586s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm sorry, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7223.948s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It does talk about money that can be used for infrastructure and water and sewer and water and sewer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7230.613s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And water and soil.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7231.735s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7233.376s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's my right to say my free speech, and it's my time to say what I want to say, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7239.483s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay, that's the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7241.084s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Don't shut somebody off if they're making a point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7308.401s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7308.962s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, with all due respect to the unfunded liability, if you look at the budget for the last four years, it's not been funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7315.843s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4022.61s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at that point in time, there was a gentleman by the name of Donald Ouellette, who became the city engineer here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4031.658s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And one of the reasons why he became the new city engineer is because he came from the community of Air Mass, where he instituted a new water metering program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4042.567s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At the time, Paul Guia was our director of public works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4046.37s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in December of 2002,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4048.535s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Roulette came on board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4051.176s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In January 20th of 2003, Councilor Marks and myself at the time were interviewed by the local newspaper for the purposes of the concerns that were out in the neighborhood regarding the water meter and the bills that were going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4067.242s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at that point in time, information came forward that for the past three years, prior to 2003, there were over 709 abatements<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4077.335s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that were issued by the city of Medford because of faulty water meters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4082.259s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Roulette, when he came in, indicated that the city of Medford's water meters at that time were no more, they should be no more than 10 years of age.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4091.225s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They were 17 years old at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4095.208s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So that began the crusade, so to speak, of figuring out how are we going to change these water meters?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4102.013s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Should we change these water meters?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4103.534s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when are we going to do it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4105.687s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At the time, there was over 15,000 households that had water meters that needed to be changed, as well as 150 large capacity commercial district people, which represented 50% of the water consumption and the use at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4123.961s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, in August of 2003, the concerns kept multiplying on the council from residents complaining about their tax bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4134.294s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And October 23rd, in a very rare moment by former Mayor McGlynn, he acknowledged at a public meeting that it was his fault that the meters were not changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4144.72s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the reason is the concern wasn't as bad as it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4148.502s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he told the Water and Soil Commission at that point in time that blame me, that was his quote, blame me because they just didn't want to get into the financial obligation of getting into the water meters, not realizing how serious everything was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4161.809s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4163.279s">[Robert Penta]</a>: because that got itself corrected after that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4166.241s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then on February 17 of 2004, Mayor McGlynn presented before the city council a prelude, a prelude so to speak as to what the water meter sewer count should look like and what do we need to do here to go in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4183.255s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But what he did and what he proposed, which was kind of interesting, he proposed to finance $18,000<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4189.402s">[Robert Penta]</a>: have the city council vote for $18,000 to do a preliminary review on X amount of homes and X amount of businesses in the city, just to see how bad these water meters were in commercial meters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4201.666s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what they found out was an atrocious, the decision or the results were atrocious, because what came out of all of that, where these meters were running much slower, and as a result of them running much slower, the city was losing a tremendous amount of revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4215.75s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So in October of 2004,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4219.526s">[Robert Penta]</a>: straight down October 19th, the city council voted the appropriation for $4.2 million to put new water meters here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4228.13s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And subsequent to that, the chase goes on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4231.272s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At that point in time, and that's back in 2003, at the end of 2003, the city of Medford was losing on a daily basis 189 million gallons of water a day, not getting billed, and their leakage was 113 million gallons a day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4248.325s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Those two numbers, and I would hope somebody in the council would pick up on that and make a request as to what our leakage is and loss of revenue from then it is now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4258.407s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The new water meters that came in, once again, had a 10 year lifespan and the meters on this new meeting system, they had batteries in their battery life, according to their own information that they passed up as a 10 year life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4275.433s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We've well exceeded a 10 year life on these batteries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4279.515s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe most recently there have been some concerns with people who have gotten their bills and their bills have been higher or lower than expected than what they received in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4291.819s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I really think as the concern is for parking in the city, the concern should equally be as where are we going?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4298.141s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're sitting on over $5 million in your water and sewer enterprise account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4302.043s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There needs to be some addressing to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4303.743s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When is it going to take place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4305.988s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if it's, if in fact, they're accurate in their information that they submitted and they gave us at the time when the council voted on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4314.633s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think council Max was the only one on the council at the time when we voted on this, something really needs to be done because you're gonna find yourself right back to where you were before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4323.879s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If in fact, 10 years is the mandate as their brochure says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4329.262s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So with that being said, I would hope somewhere along the line, what a 10 year battery and a 10 year life of the meter<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4335.555s">[Robert Penta]</a>: something needs to be looked at because we're going to find ourselves right back into the same problem that we were when they were 17 years of age and you brought in a new person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4344.78s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Second comment, Mr. President, I think it was three weeks ago when I appeared before here, when they were talking about the 5G situation, I said at that point in time that I believed, I believed, and it's my mistake, I misquoted myself,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4359.93s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe that that time that one of the people who happens to be the director of public, what's her name?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4366.774s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Public health at that point in time had voted for some of the passing and not for passing some of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4374.519s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Sort of like split down the middle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4376.36s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I want to thank council Max.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4377.641s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I want to compliment him because of his institution of pushing forward the folks that had their place, not have that 5G go in front of their house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4390.984s">[Robert Penta]</a>: at their last meeting, I think that sets the tempo for people to stand up and say, hey, you can fight the government and you can push them back if you have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4398.83s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They've set the standard now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4400.832s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And people out there, if you don't want that 5G in front of your house, now's your time to complain because they've already set the trademark.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4406.917s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the council, I believe the vote was four to nothing on that particular issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4413.262s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Two last comments, and they go like this, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4416.125s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The two gentlemen that you just talked about, Tom Kianciano and Bob McGovern,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4420.21s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think the underlying issue there to their lives are that they were born and bred in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4426.836s">[Robert Penta]</a>: True Medford family folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4429.899s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Something that's very hard to understand today for people who just move in here, who think that even though they've been here for 10 to 15 years, they know Medford like somebody in their family who's lived here their whole life, who's been well respected within the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4445.132s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They both happen to have a Wellington background.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4448.135s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they both happen to have a big family background, something that's hard to find today and to be respected for and to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4455.678s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So with that being said, I congratulate you for bringing the issue of dedicating the meeting on their behalf.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4461.581s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think it's a true honor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4463.962s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think also would be a true honor for this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4466.962s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're getting ready to deal with your budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4468.483s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's coming up pretty soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4470.184s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is a big issue as far as I'm concerned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4472.144s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If I was running for office right now, I would be running to find out where are and is the money for these meters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4479.088s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do they have to be replaced?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4480.348s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When are they going to be replaced?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4482.129s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And how and where is the money going to be found?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4484.13s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Are they going to take it out of the Water and Sewer Enterprise account or what have you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4488.712s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is serious money and this is serious community money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4492.294s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And let me just leave you with one last thought, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4494.194s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd like to ask you a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4495.72s">[Robert Penta]</a>: because I look forward to every Tuesday night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4498.002s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You started this about three or four weeks ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4500.324s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't hear any more from the director of public health on an update as to what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4504.948s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And is there a reason for that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4515.277s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if I remember correctly, the one week she couldn't come, she gave you a written synopsis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4519.46s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I haven't heard, I haven't heard anything like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4521.96s">[Robert Penta]</a>: because people look forward to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4523.22s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I would just hope maybe, you know, that gets itself reinstituted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4526.901s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But as far as just getting back real quick on the water meters and the whole idea of the meters, it's going to turn out to be a big issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4534.722s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's going to be a financial concern for this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4536.703s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I'm quite sure when council Marks and myself at that point in time in 2003, we viewed 709 abatements having been filed because the meters were not cooperating correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4550.485s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And thankfully, Mayor McGlynn finally understood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4552.527s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's the reason why he put the appropriation in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4555.268s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't want to get yourself into that position again right now, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4559.111s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think it will serve you any good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4561.413s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I have all the records here of everything that took place, how we got to where we got at that point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4568.658s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I would hope that the council does not find themselves in that same position again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4572.741s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4573.642s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5226.179s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5226.319s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, just one quick, Council Marks and Council Falco are both correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5231.94s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The software that the city was supposed to purchase would cost anywhere between 100 and 115,000 at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5238.501s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they figured that the reason that they would save the money on that is just think about all the abatements that you would not have to service, the people that would have to leave work or whatever it might be to come to a hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5248.242s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And sometimes if they didn't even win on their abatement process, they'd have to take that to the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5252.853s">[Robert Penta]</a>: district go over and some of them, but Councilor Falco is absolutely right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5257.475s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The way the program was sold is you were going to have an abatement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5261.037s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You were going to have a program with a software.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5263.598s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if any house spiked irregularly, they would contact the taxpayer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5268.301s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It should not be the taxpayer contacting the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5271.342s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think that's the key.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5273.764s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That was the key as Councilor Markswell alluded to and Councilor Falco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5277.446s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's just, you know, when you say out of sight out of mind, but that's not right either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5282.689s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's the biggest, other than doing a public works street or a sidewalk, it's the biggest financial obligation that the city has to its taxpayers as it relates to make sure that the water and sewer system works properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5297.121s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if it's not working properly and there is something wrong with the infrastructure below the street, below the sidewalk, how's the taxpayer gonna know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5304.987s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When in fact you're collecting, you're raising the taxes each and every year, you're raising the rates each and every year,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5310.664s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You supposedly have this system and you're still telling the taxpayer, you've got to call city hall to find out what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5317.209s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That doesn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5318.41s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I think you get your work cut off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11502.76s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The mic isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11504.081s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Bob Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11506.782s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, I appreciate the fact that this is an ongoing thing, and I want to compliment Councilor Marks<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11512.329s">[Robert Penta]</a>: because speaking throughout the community, he has taken the charge on this particular issue, not to be for or against, but just to bring the awareness and to have some understanding of a communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11523.492s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As I said before, this is a $5 billion G5 undertaking by Verizon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11529.913s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And some two years ago, when they first came into the city and had a discussion on this, they allegedly stated there was 143 locations or 143 polls<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11539.053s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that they had identified here in the city of Medford as to where they were gonna go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11542.796s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, these poles are all owned by National Grid and on National Grid's poles, you have fire, you have police, you have alarm systems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11550.541s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're all pole renters and they pay National Grid to be on those poles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11556.185s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And by paying National Grid to be on those poles, National Grid is now receiving a financial inducement, so to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11566.468s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In return, that inducement doesn't find itself anywhere back to the rate payers of National Grid, but all Verizon is doing is getting more and more profit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11576.754s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they're not spending $5 billion just for the sake of having $5 billion to spend, because the subscribers to Verizon plans are gonna pay for that in the long run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11586.159s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's been no explanation as between 4G to 5G, whether there's anything medically or substantially different,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11594.226s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that could possibly hurt somebody because of the medical portions of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11598.448s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the question then becomes, and alluding back to council Marx's comment, if you have the lady who is a board of health director, who sits on this board of four, which makes no sense at all, but who sits on this board of four, you've had 11 votes so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11613.676s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And of those 11 votes, six of them have been against and five of them had been for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11619.983s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, I would strongly suggest that you would ask, some one of you folks, ask a question of why the people voted the way they did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11628.165s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because if you understood last week, there was two young ladies here from a certain part of Medford who was concerned about a poll being in front of their house and the poll being in front of their house, not wanting it there, not knowing what the 5G could admit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11641.748s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So of the five that got approved as compared to the six that didn't get approved,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11646.181s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do the six have an argument against the five or does the five have an argument against the six?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11650.363s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Are we going to play what kind of game is this going to turn out to be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11653.884s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who gets it and who doesn't get it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11655.625s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11656.966s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the most important thing that I think is missing here that the mayor of this community, having this committee being sent up should have made some kind of an agreement with Verizon as to what the city of Medford is going to get in return<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11669.793s">[Robert Penta]</a>: for having Verizon come into this city and go from 4G to 5G, because the only one right now that's going to be making all the money up front is going to be National Grid on the poles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11678.997s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And Verizon in the long run will get this, whether it goes to 5G, 6G, 7G, who knows, that's not the point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11684.88s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The fact of the matter is they're here, they were planning for it as of two years ago, whether it's 143 poles or 143 locations, that seems to be the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11694.344s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if you're going to have this meeting,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11696.345s">[Robert Penta]</a>: this meeting, however this meeting is going to be sent up, what's the logic?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11700.267s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What's the reasoning behind approval and disapproval?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11704.028s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if the director of public health voted against it, and even if it was because she felt that it wasn't right for the city, then it's not right for the city all the time, not just part of the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11715.913s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And those people that voted for it, as compared to the six times they didn't vote for it, well, what was their logic to it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11722.569s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think it's very important that if they're going to make a decision, and you said there's 11 requirements on there, then those 11 requirements have to be met by all applicants that come, all 42 applicants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11734.674s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if that's being said, there's no logic, there's no rhyme or reason right now to the 11 decisions that have been made thus far, six for, six against, and five for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11744.459s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How do you justify that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11745.619s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How do you explain to the city that you have this committee of ongoing people with no experts on there<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11752.674s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That doesn't make any sense at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11754.217s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when the taxpayers can ask that question, you have this subcommittee that's not even odd number, it's even.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11762.83s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and you're being restricted according to FCC that you can't vote because of any medical concerns, but you have your own director of public health on the committee and she votes against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11774.722s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, what's her logic for voting against it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11777.505s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What are all the other members who voted against it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11780.348s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What was their logic?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11781.649s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what was the logic of the five that got approved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11784.953s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's important to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11786.795s">[Robert Penta]</a>: because you're going to play playing this game with 40 somewhat applications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11790.477s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Some get it, some don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11792.217s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Some streets get it, some don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11794.058s">[Robert Penta]</a>: One house has it, another one doesn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11795.799s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what are you going to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11797.26s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Wind up having a lawsuit between people in the city saying, hey, how can you give it to one and not another?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11802.622s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I didn't want it there, but you let it be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11804.983s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's a good suggestion you came up with, Councilor Marks, because if somebody wants to come and put a poll in a particular area, then maybe they should<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11812.102s">[Robert Penta]</a>: come in advance, say this is where we'd like to do it, and get a find out, let's find out if people are for it or against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11819.106s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the one thing you forgot to mention on whether it's Burlington or Cambridge, they've got a committee, they've got a committee that's uniform, either it's for or against, it's not split.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11829.872s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you're dealing with a subcommittee or whatever you want to call this committee, that's split, you have no professionals,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11836.445s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No medical experts, you definitely don't have any technical experts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11840.026s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And with that being said, how can anybody trust that whether 5G is better than 4G, medically or otherwise, it doesn't exist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11848.369s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But this city is allowing a multi-billion dollar corporation to come in and right now, nobody knows if the city of Medford is getting anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11858.172s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Nobody knows if this mayor has made any kind of an agreement with Verizon to come in here and do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11863.354s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the only ones that are gonna get rich in the long run<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11866.596s">[Robert Penta]</a>: is going to be rising in the long run and national grid up front, and your rates aren't going to go down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11872.002s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So what have you accomplished?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11873.804s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Or better yet, you've allowed somebody to come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11877.067s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11877.728s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You should have this meeting with that subcommittee, with the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11881.852s">[Robert Penta]</a>: with the legal counsel that you have, and you should bring in a medical and you should bring in a legal expert.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11886.257s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Doesn't make any difference if FCC rules and regulations say you can't vote on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11890.14s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a determination because if the person that's on the committee is medically entitled with the knowledge to know that the 5Gs<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11898.032s">[Robert Penta]</a>: will not work in behalf of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11899.872s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can't pick and choose what part of the city you want it to go in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11902.893s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It either is or it isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11904.533s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Your technical person will say either it is or it isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11907.454s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can't go from 4G to 5G.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11909.575s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where's your expert to tell you what's the difference between the two?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11912.355s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That hasn't even come out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11915.216s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Oh, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11916.176s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That hasn't even come out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11918.457s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are important questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11919.677s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So they've already voted on 11 applications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11923.478s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11925.438s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can't run a professional business on something such as this and then be left out in the cold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11931.404s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And here are seven of you trying to ask questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11933.806s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have one city council who took the bull by the horns and the people appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11939.251s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11940.112s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think all seven of you appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11942.474s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the fact of the matter is one simple question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11946.418s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who's running the show here, Verizon?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11949.909s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't know, they seem to be running the show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11952.271s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it National Grid?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11953.272s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because it's their poll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11954.933s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're allowing to go up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11956.494s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're allowing renters to go up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11958.836s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't have any verification from anybody in the city, from the mayor down, where that transparency is, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11965.121s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It needs to come out, it needs to be found.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11969.524s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if this continues to go on like this, and you folks know me, and that four member committee just keeps going on, and they make those approvals,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11976.758s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, then shame on the people of Medford for electing the administration that has allowed this to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11983.343s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You city council have at least taken your position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11986.325s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But there's a transparency issue here that needs to come forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11989.428s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it has yet to come forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11991.109s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And because of that, somebody is going to have to pay the price for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11994.652s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And hopefully, the 5G doesn't go into neighborhoods where people subsequently medically find out that there was something wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12002.691s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't want to find yourself into like a Johnson and Johnson situation that just came up now with the federal government because people now have a concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12010.335s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's been some bad reactions to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12012.396s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Does that mean that they're all bad?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12013.677s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, it doesn't mean that they're all that they're bad, but you've got plenty of time to test this thing out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12017.999s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If they've been here two years ago, since 2019 and saying that we're going to have 143 locations, and this is now 2021, something is wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12027.524s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If there's been no situation, no communication, I would respectfully ask that one of you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12032.851s">[Robert Penta]</a>: ask the city administration, the mayor's office, what, if anything, is the city of Medford going to get, or is the city of Medford getting, by allowing Verizon to come in and put 5G on these poles?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12045.603s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a money matter, follow the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12047.605s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's all about money, as we all know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12050.007s">[Robert Penta]</a>: $5 billion is not chump change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12052.469s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a huge investment nationwide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12054.972s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when T-Mobile can rent off the same pole<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12058.922s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that Verizon is putting up, you know, they're all making money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12063.545s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=6521.308s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, I would like to, if the young lady felt insulted, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=6527.232s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But that's the marketing that Verizon does when they go out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=6530.955s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They go to the lowest socioeconomic areas because that's the ones that they feel that they can move into first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=6538.62s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what I said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4027.53s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4028.17s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As a matter of fact, Mr. President, I'm picking up on your resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4032.483s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that took place in 2016, because at that time it was the second year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4037.987s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I believe along with you and Councilor Knight and then Councilor Brianna Longo, there was some concerns with Park Method and their distribution of how the revenue was going to be coming in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4049.214s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Therefore, as a result of that, what we needed to go to, as I indicated back then, was to go to the contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4057.079s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in the contract on page five, there is two specific sections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4060.921s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It basically includes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4062.722s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that states 20 days after the end of each month, a monthly report would be submitted to the city of Medford as it relates to a whole host of issues relative to the inventory of monies taken in and what's going out and what the fees and everything were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4078.631s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, there's an inclusion in there that the operator, meaning Park Method, would agree to submit on an annual basis the gross revenue and the operating expenses<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4088.74s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So on an annual basis, so rather than having you go and get all the monthly things, I'm requesting that the council puts a resolution forward, making that request as it relates to their annual revenue, relative to the fact that this is what took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4105.126s">[Robert Penta]</a>: For example, you would have net city parking revenue, that's annual appeals, the annual appeal, dismissal, forgiveness, annual resident visitor parking permits, business permits,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4118.592s">[Robert Penta]</a>: commuter permits, annual parking citations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4122.074s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then we get to the issue on an annual basis of the $50,000 annually that would go to the commercial districts here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4134.08s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now that was something that came up by Mayor McGlynn in, I believe, October of 2014.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4139.923s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of that, that became a bone of consternation between<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4146.513s">[Robert Penta]</a>: the Medford Chamber of Commerce and the business people, and as well as the issue on the city council relative toward the business districts not getting X amount of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4157.182s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Therefore, as a result of that, what took place was that in October of that year, the city at that time through Mayor McGlynn, and then Park Medford came to a final resolution before January of 2015,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4173.491s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and 15.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4175.412s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in 2015, that $50,000 for each square was then included as part of the agreement between Park Method and the City of Method.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4184.458s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in their brochure, they note specifically that $250,000 annually will be subject to the appropriation for district improvements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4193.243s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4194.269s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know where that money is, if it's ever gone there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4197.311s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Some people say it's gone out once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4199.392s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Some people say maybe it has, maybe it hasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4201.753s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know, I can't answer that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4203.354s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's the reason why I'm asking for this breakdown and how the money was being expended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4209.637s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Next, we have the issue relative toward $2 million a year is what Park Method said that they would bring in annually to the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4220.623s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if we look at that $2 million per year,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4223.996s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in the contract, there was an inclusion that anything over $1,250,000 annually, the city would increase from its annual 35% net revenues to 83%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4235.479s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The question then becomes where, and if in fact, has Park Method submitted that type of information to the city of Metro?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4243.702s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4244.162s">[Robert Penta]</a>: None of us know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4245.823s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And again, once again, that's the reason why I'm here asking you folks to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4250.902s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So then let's go to the issue that basically talks about, I think it was in October during a city council strike that award six committee candidates on October of 2019.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4263.351s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then council Longo addressed the community at that point in time as it related to the method parking program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4271.838s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Quote, this is what she said, as to parking enforcement, it is broken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4276.86s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If elected, I will end the contract that expires during the next mayoral term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4281.824s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I will go back to the committee recommendations of 2009 to implement in-house enforcement and replace the kiosks with meters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4290.35s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I will provide free parking for our seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4293.532s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The city will benefit by keeping 100% of the gross revenue for our city services and schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4299.036s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We currently see only 35% of the revenues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4302.577s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, that's a tough point right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4304.759s">[Robert Penta]</a>: 35% of the revenues, because we really don't know because you've never received the public documentation back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4309.944s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You, Mr. President, have asked three times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4313.047s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Resolutions go back and suggest that and prove that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4316.67s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So where do we go from there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4318.752s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's the question of why I think you really need to know how much money has come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4324.386s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How has park method delivered as they're supposed to occur, so into the contract and the city of Medford, how they made an accounting for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4331.451s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's public information, it needs to be made public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4334.213s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the question then becomes, if in fact the contract has been adhered to, and if in fact revenues have exceeded that for which the 35% formula has taken place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4348.484s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the question then becomes, if it hasn't taken place,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4352.346s">[Robert Penta]</a>: then where are those revenues?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4355.228s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's also a report that's out that you can go on Google and it's by the Method Parking Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4362.454s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they have a report that goes out there that basically says, through their Google webpage, that on an annual basis, the city of Medford is, if you add up their numbers, that the city of Medford has only collected approximately $436,000 per year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4377.567s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4381.485s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number two, the statistics that the city has in the city of Medford allegedly will substantiate that we're only getting 35% rather than the 83%, which would indicate we haven't exceeded that for which you would get the $1.3 million annual money that they collected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4400.822s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But according to Park Medford, when they first came in, they said that their annual revenue would be in excess of $2 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4406.243s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So $2 million over a period of 20 years, or even over a period of eight years, would give you $16 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4411.845s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're nowhere, we're nowhere near that type of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4415.286s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I would strongly suggest that if this be the case, what really needs to be addressed is as follows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4421.848s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have the 2009 report to which Council Marks served on there with the then former Chief of Police Sacco and a whole list of other folks who made up an extensive and an exhaustive report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4434.952s">[Robert Penta]</a>: as to how much they went to other communities, they checked it out, they saw how the revenues could come in and where it should go in here for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4442.935s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The question then becomes Mr. President, if elected means she has been elected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4447.837s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So since the mayor has now been elected, the question then becomes the 35%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4452.899s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We really need to get these numbers to find out, are we in the 35% or are we above the 35%?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4458.702s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And lastly, just let me say this, and this is really the perplexing question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4463.063s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If in fact we follow what the mayor<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4465.424s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then city council said in October of 2019, to follow that formula of this report, why then do we have another new committee report of people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4477.326s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is the mayor going to change plans, change direction, not follow the 2009 report?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4483.107s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think you people really need to know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4484.807s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if people are sitting on that committee and it's gonna be a waste of time because you're just gonna follow the exhausted committee report of 2009, that needs to be relegated out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4494.534s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, this is a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4497.116s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if we're only looking at $436,000 a year as compared to a lot more than that, because we haven't gotten to the $2 million mark per year, you need to know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4506.824s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you really need to have a discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4508.865s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it was you then Councilor, Mr. President and Councilor Knight and Councilor Marks and Councilor Brianna Longo-Cunningham had serious questions with Park Method over this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4518.962s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You indicated, Mr. President, that this is year eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4521.905s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is years eight, nine, and 10 are the years for negotiation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4525.688s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they're taking them one year at a time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4527.469s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, if they're taking them one year at a time, and the mayor said, and when she ran for mayor, that she was going back and she was going to get rid of Park Method, then the plan ought to be that Park Method's going to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4538.559s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There should be no negotiation to extend anything here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4557.293s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe this is the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4558.713s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I may have the wrong terminology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4559.973s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is the committee to discuss parking in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4604.457s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So then the question that I asked the council and to you, Mr. President, if the mayor indicated she was going to look at the 2009, she was going to adhere to that report, then the traffic, this new committee that's been put together, are they discussing this report to add or subtract?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4619.46s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is the mayor not going to support this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4621.82s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Are she going to entertain another type of situation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4624.441s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because this is very conflicting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4630.427s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, if you're going to be on one year renewals in years eight, nine, and 10, give you the option to bow out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4635.689s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you've had plenty of time to realize coming into your option year that something should be taking place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4641.332s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So are we going to, as a community, take three years in a row as option years and work at it one at a time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4648.355s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4703.148s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, I'd like to answer that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4704.83s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A constant night brings up a good point that three years when it first came up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4709.031s">[Robert Penta]</a>: was nixed by then city solicitor Mark Romney.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4711.992s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He said it would not serve in the best financial interest of the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4716.074s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That bumped up the contract to 10 years, but given years eight, nine, and 10, the flexibility, whether you'd want to renegotiate, get out or whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4725.237s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm only concerned over the fact that you, Mr. President, dating back at least three times going back to 2016, coming forward with council resolution have asked for these numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4735.325s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Senior citizens have been waiting to park for nothing for free, because that's what was alleged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4740.106s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Same comment was made in Inauguration Day, same comment was made in 2009.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4745.708s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if we're not going to follow this report of 2009, which is very extensive, and it wasn't just for the city of Medford, you can correct me Councilor Marks, you went to other cities and towns, you saw how they derived their revenue through meters and their timing, and whether they had resident parking, commuter parking, this and that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4764.068s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If that is not going to really be entertained, I just think that this parking commission, Councilor Scott Bell, it's just a waste of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4771.624s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We either follow something or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4773.964s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Are you going to change it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4774.965s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think the mayor has an obligation to tell you and the taxpayers of this community, whether in fact we're going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4781.546s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why would you want to go into two more years of one year contracts trying to figure out what you're going to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4786.967s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You should know by now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4788.567s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Resolutions dating back to 2016 and 17 with her name and many councilors names on there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4794.189s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Question, just as councilor Knight has indicated, the veracity of this contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4799.33s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, how is it going to work with the city of Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4802.429s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Approximately $2 million in uncollected money is still outstanding again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4808.26s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is on the Google page of the Medford Parking Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4825.294s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor President, I'm going to disagree with you, because when this council issue came up before the council, it started in May of 2014.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4831.479s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it ran on for a few months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4833.861s">[Robert Penta]</a>: While the mayor and some of the councilors had a difference of opinion,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4836.463s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It did go on, there was some public interaction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4839.305s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if this mayor is going to entertain a new contract without having the council interaction and public awareness and public input, that's bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4847.729s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is really bad because that's not what you call transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5137.58s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, one quick thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5142.001s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor Marks, you talked about Everett, talked about Revere, talked about Somerville, you talked about Boston, Brookline, Malden, and Everett.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5152.483s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A thorough report from the hiring of a clerk to the amount of people that walked the streets and the monies that were collected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5158.605s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're not gonna get more of a thorough report than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5160.705s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this new commission, for whatever the reason is, it's out there and why the mayor is doing it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5165.505s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And nobody knows, but that question ought to be asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5168.166s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you made the commitment in 2019 to do with this one, why are you going in a different direction?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5173.489s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5174.59s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, if I could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5178.432s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Council member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2496.042s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Pentez, Zero Summit Road, Method Nest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2500.766s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think what I have on the agenda is a discussion of Method's pay to park program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2508.811s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I believe you gave me the catalyst to do this, Mr. Caraviello, Council President, because for some years you've asked for a report<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2517.686s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and we really haven't gotten a report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2519.687s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know if you can hear me on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2521.848s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is this coming through?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2524.609s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can hear me, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2526.029s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay, I'd like to go back to, as a quick side note, to September of 2009, when then Mayor McGlynn had a commission set up as it relates to how was parking going to be addressed in the city because it was a revenue item here in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2543.276s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At that point in time, Councilor Marks served on that committee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2547.489s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And one of their recommendations was to possibly look into having a civilian parking commission in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2554.194s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now that was in 2009.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2557.075s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it didn't take place until I believe it started in May of 2014, when then Mayor McGlynn decided we were going to do something about parking here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2568.983s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of that, from the months of May through the months of December of 2014, we went through<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2576.884s">[Robert Penta]</a>: an arduous task of reviewing how and what packing was going to be here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2583.887s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So what I'm asking for is that a complete breakdown from inception, starting from calendar year 2015, right up to date, be brought forward, and I'm going to pass out something for all you councillors at the end, that we get so not only the U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2600.995s">[Robert Penta]</a>: councillors, but we as citizens have an idea of just how much money that's coming in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2607.058s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Asking for a complete itemized detail is found in the contract that was signed by the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2614.462s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at that point in time, the public parking point, I believe has been resold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2619.425s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it states on page five on section six on the gross revenue, it says within 20 days after the end of each month, the operator shall provide to the city a statement showing all revenue, including details<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2633.742s">[Robert Penta]</a>: of citation revenue, meter revenue, permit revenue, and other revenues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2638.225s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this statement must include a copy of the monthly statement from the separate bank accounts utilized by the operator for the payments and received by the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2647.97s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I'm really not asking for anything other than what should be in this building right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2653.073s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the only thing that this building has been able to afford was in the calendar year 2015 and the calendar year 2016, the first report<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2663.213s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that the then city council asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2665.895s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And subsequent to that, nothing has come forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2668.496s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe you have asked three times, Mr. President for a report, an itemized report for which the contract says they were obligated to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2676.962s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So we're not asking for anything that's outrageous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2678.963s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's in this building somewhere, somehow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2682.245s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, another thing you need to remember is they said, they meaning Republic at the time, they said that the revenues coming into the city of Medford would be approximately $2 million per year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2693.844s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So right now we're into the end of the seventh year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2696.586s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So that would be approximately $14 million thereabouts to be accounted for according to their terms as it relates to what the revenues would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2706.215s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if you go on the Medford Parking Commission, they have a Google page here from the city of Medford and they extrapolated from Park Medford, a list of outstanding monies that have owned this old, the city of Medford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2722.214s">[Robert Penta]</a>: since 2015.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2722.534s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In 2015, still owed, if I'm reading it correctly, it's $339,449.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2725.377s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In 2016, it's $368,140.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2725.697s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In 2017, it's $375,611.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2726.157s">[Robert Penta]</a>: 2018, it's $351,470.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2726.518s">[Robert Penta]</a>: 2019, it's $339,449.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2751.378s">[Robert Penta]</a>: $148 and past year 2020 was $163,875.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2758.441s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Again, if I'm reading this correctly, but I'm standing here tonight to be corrected if I'm wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2763.143s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But from reading what Park Method has submitted and what the Method Parking Commission is saying, that's $1,937,693.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2771.947s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's outstanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2772.967s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's still owed here to the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2780.612s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He's a random.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2789.755s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These amounts have yet to be accounted for as being satisfied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2798.498s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, I'm just telling you with the traffic commission, parking commission, excuse me, it's put on their webpage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2805.1s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But again, as I said, I stand here to be corrected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2807.901s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Plus the fact, plus the fact I believe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2811.574s">[Robert Penta]</a>: the $2 million per year that was indicated was part of what park, I mean, Republic Parking said on October, 2014.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2822.639s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if we look and if these numbers are true, there's a little bit of a problem there, why they haven't been collected upon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2831.024s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But therefore, if we're getting $2 million a year for the last seven years, that's $14 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2837.372s">[Robert Penta]</a>: years eight, nine, and 10, I believe are they're renegotiating yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2840.273s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I really don't know if the city's renegotiating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2842.874s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I know they have a new traffic commission, a group of people looking at where you should go and how you're going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2848.416s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think you guys and Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2850.997s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Morell, you should be up to date as it relates to, you know, what the city is doing with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2856.259s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Another thing is there is, and I believe- Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2863.481s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was an October- What information council members?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2888.475s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Being aware of the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2889.396s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if in fact these numbers are any way correct, that's $1,937,000 takes back to 2015.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2896.071s">[Robert Penta]</a>: there's something wrong with the city not being able to get that money, separate issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2900.634s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Taking that one step forward, in October of 2014, for those of you that might remember, there was the argument of the five squares, Medford Square being one, would get on an annual basis $50,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2913.084s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that was a ball of contention, especially here in the city of Medford, Chamber of Commerce, and then Mayor Mike McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2919.268s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But toward the end of the year, I believe it was in December of 2014, there was an agreement reached<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2925.923s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There was an agreement reached with Park Method as it relates to, they now, they would be willing to submit $250,000 would be earmarked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2937.188s">[Robert Penta]</a>: $250,000 would be earmarked on an annual basis, 50,000 for each square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2940.85s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They put that in their folder, in their folder that they passed out, which specifically states that $250,000 annually be subject to appropriation for the district improvement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2953.375s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's the five districts here in the city of Metro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2955.69s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I know it's been some conversation with the chamber, and I know it's been asked a couple of times, but if that'd be the case, that $50,000 a year going forward for four of the last five years would be approximately $200,000 each square that they haven't seen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2972.333s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Again, the accounting of the money, this goes back to like last week on the water money, on the fees, there has to be an accounting where it's going, how it's being spent, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2983.543s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if you take that, put that all together, Mr. President, Mr. Messenger, could you please pass this up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2990.124s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm asking on this particular issue here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2997.525s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it's important to know that while you might be having a commission or a committee to be looking at the parking revenues, there doesn't seem to be anything going forward because it states on page six, I believe, of the contract<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3013.588s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that this has to be a renegotiating year with the people that we have in the city right now, years eight, nine, and 10, is the city in fact in a negotiation with the parking company?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3031.06s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're on a one year contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3032.2s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3032.941s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So for example, if we're on a one year contract, which is year eight, which we're on right now, it's possible at any point in time, this contract ends at the end of this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3044.375s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So it's up to the administration that that be the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3046.996s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would thank Mr. President if in fact that the two million dollars was the estimated amount that we would be getting on an annual basis and we're looking at 1.9 million plus and monies that are owed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3058.563s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Something's not jiving here because those monies whether they're making the two million dollars a year or not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3065.555s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How do you let each and every year, how do you let that just continue to escalate and escalate and escalate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3070.518s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3071.298s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's unfair to the people who pay every single day to use the meters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3076.08s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's unfair as to the contract as it's written.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3079.942s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So it's either a lack of enforcement or I'm reading these numbers wrong, or there's something wrong on the adding and subtracting of how this money's being spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3089.827s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What you have here, what I gave you comes right out of the contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3094.49s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The contract is even more specific and more definitive as to what you're looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3099.571s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That, as it's written, tells you basically how much money is coming in and where's the majority of it going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3105.233s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The key point to all of this is whether you stay with the company you have now or you go with a new company, you have an in-house, something has to be considered as it relates to outstanding liabilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3117.755s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you can't run $1,900,000 in an ongoing liability that started from day one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3125.319s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It just doesn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3127.3s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I would hope that somebody would make a resolution and ask for an annual breakdown of Park Method.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3135.544s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, what the contract says does for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3143.429s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Say it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3145.57s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, that's what I'm asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3161.711s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Nobody's going to do it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3165.332s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What are you asking for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3167.913s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What I gave you right there is a sample of what's on page six, section, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3177.395s">[Robert Penta]</a>: For five years, since inception, from 2015, coming forward, how you got to your revenues, how did you get to your receipts, how did you get to your expenses?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3187.37s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've only done it twice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3200.099s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Say it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3447.78s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3450.12s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know if you can hear me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3453.481s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, can you hear it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3458.763s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Back in May of 2017, what was presented here before the city of Medford was a new, what they call a base,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3467.498s">[Robert Penta]</a>: rate of 861 per household.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3470.979s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then the different charge would be for the commercial district folks here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3478.622s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then one of the arguments was that it would raise $1 million a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3483.384s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That was approximately 4% of what the city's budget was at that point in time required for the water and sewer services in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3491.807s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Subsequent to that, it's gone on for the last three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3496.0s">[Robert Penta]</a>: now coming into its fourth fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3498.821s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I believe a response that was sent back to the city, you folks, pursuant to a request from one of your colleagues, was a breakdown of how much money each and every one of the last three fiscal years amounted to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3513.945s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Inclusive of that amount, again, was the term of $1 million to be used per year, but they never reached the $1 million per year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3524.563s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What was reached was $2,585,362.66 as compared to the $3 million that was allegedly stated that the city would gain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3538.411s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's a difference of $414,637.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3539.612s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So where do we go with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3544.875s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where we go with that, the argument was that that would be used to supplement water and sewer for whatever needs might be if something were to come up<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3554.937s">[Robert Penta]</a>: also to subsidize the water and sewer department in case of something that's anticipated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3561.501s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In the letter that came back, it indicated here that the universal connectivity fee is an infrastructure recovery charge to be hooked into and maintained in the water and sewer system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3574.349s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The fixed base connectivity fee is estimated at $1 million per year to help stabilize revenues in this place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3584.439s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That response also indicated that that money goes to your water and sewer account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3590.161s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There is no breakdown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3592.182s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There is no breakdown to the charges, commercial or residential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3597.084s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There is no breakdown also as to how and where that money has been spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3602.127s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there is no program that is set up presently that tells you what that money can be used for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3608.149s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So right now, all it's done has been included into your water and sewer account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3612.957s">[Robert Penta]</a>: One of the misnomers to this whole project, when sold back in 2017, was in case there is a, in case, that's the word, in case there is a deficit in either the water or sewer account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3625.904s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In the years 2016 and 17, there were deficits on the sewer side, not the water side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3632.428s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But each and every year, when the water and sewer budget is estimated, it's estimated on what the work is going to be here in the city of Medford, and also,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3640.852s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The water and the sewer rates that you get from the MWRA, those rates come in ahead of time, not after a budget is made and set.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3648.896s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's another misnomer as it relates to the full program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3652.118s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So approximately right now, you're sitting on $2,585,000 of base rate fees or charges, whatever the term you want to use, that has come from the Mr. and Mrs. Metro taxpayer has been put into the general revenues of your water and sewer account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3671.14s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That ladies and gentlemen is not the proper accounting practices and procedures because in your own water and sewer account, you have to have it broken down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3681.064s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have it broken down by employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3683.185s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have it broken down by cost of material.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3685.586s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have it broken down by the named individuals in the trucks and everything else that goes along with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3691.309s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My suggestion to you folks would be simply this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3695.231s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can't put a fee on somebody or a charge<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3698.987s">[Robert Penta]</a>: without knowing what you're charging them for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3702.228s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3703.429s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If that's the case, you should have just raised the water and sewer account by the approximate 4% that you think it was going to do to offset it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3711.031s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if you're sitting on a surplus of approximately $7 million or thereabouts in your water and sewer enterprise account, and you're sitting on approximately having already raised $2.5 million, but you still don't know how it was spent, where it was gonna go,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3727.116s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where is the projected projects that are supposed to come?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3730.238s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't make any sense because right now, what it's saying is it's a water and sewage charge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3735.881s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was to services in case something were to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3740.984s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The original proposal back in 2017 was the charge for the water meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3746.607s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that was the charge that was going to be placed on each and every residential person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3751.27s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So we know right now that that charge every single time, once it comes out,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3756.162s">[Robert Penta]</a>: is not for the meter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3757.642s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But unfortunately, for accounting purposes, because you can't figure it out, in this city, in the accounting department, there is nothing to be found that'll tell you how and where that money was spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3769.145s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you can find it in water and sewer, in their particular budgets, independently separated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3774.806s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My suggestion would be to you, that you have a budget coming up this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3779.067s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would hope that maybe somebody would make a request and ask the question, because it doesn't make any sense<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3784.759s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that the response that came back from the finance director, we don't keep an accounting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3789.882s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, if you don't keep an accounting, how do you keep an accounting of residential and commercial meters that you have and what you're going to be charged?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3799.367s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How can you allege that you're going to be taking in a million dollars a year when you haven't even got to that figure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3806.171s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Something needs to be said as it relates to these type of budgetary items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3810.813s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Seven weeks ago, I came in here and I think I explained something like seven items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3814.81s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm going to go through them all one at a time, not tonight, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3818.232s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I will go through them all one at a time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3820.374s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because good accounting procedures tells you what comes in has got to go out and how does it go out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3827.579s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've got situations here that you really don't know why should you be charging these people to supplement or augment a water and sewer account that's presently sitting in millions of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3838.106s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have yet to be told what the cost is going to be for an anticipated construction<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3843.756s">[Robert Penta]</a>: sidewalk, street reconstruction might be because of water and sewer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3848.278s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if you keep taking in these monies from Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer, you're overcharging them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3854.061s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're overcharging them each and every year on this base rate, the speed, whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3859.123s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Point of information, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3904.033s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, while that may be true, there's also, you talk about general accounting practices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3908.295s">[Robert Penta]</a>: General accounting practices does state that if you are going to put a budgetary item on a budget, as you councilors get each and every year, the question needs to be asked, if I'm going to just put $100 million, so to speak, and put it into a line item, and there's no accounting of the money, other than the fact I just put it into an account, what's the purpose of that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3929.019s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you're right, it's an administrative prerogative, but when it came up in May of 2017, it was contentiously argued at this Medford City Council as to why we need this new fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3940.91s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at that point in time, the argument was for the purposes of the meters, for the accounting of the meters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3947.015s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now it's going into the general revenue, and now we're being told that there is no delineation, there's no explanation, there's no accounting of how that money's being spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3955.202s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if that's the case,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3956.607s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as Councilors, if there's no explanation of how it's being spent, before you used to have the accounting firm of Melanson and Heath, you don't have them anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3964.609s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have them for like 15 years out of New Hampshire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3966.809s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a new accounting company that comes in here, they're supposed to do an annual audit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3970.73s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That question ought to come up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3972.05s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because if you remember correctly, if you looked at the Melanson and Heath audits, that was one of their concerns on the MWRA, especially in our water and sewer accounts, if you go back and read them, the accounting and the prioritizing how the money is spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3985.946s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This account, or this money, Councilor Knight, there's no accounting with the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3990.329s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It just goes into a general revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4003.38s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As watchdogs of the city's money, over and beyond the administration, the administration can make a proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4008.924s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The bottom line is here with the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4010.325s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You either vote it up or you vote it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4012.187s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you're going to vote it up or you're going to vote it down,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4014.161s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The question is, what are you voting on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4016.222s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if something comes to your attention to be questioned as to why and how, this is where it's going to take place in the Medford City Council Chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4038.148s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then I would respectfully suggest, if we follow that train of thought, I would respectfully suggest a freedom of information<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4044.3s">[Robert Penta]</a>: request to the city auditor, asking the city auditor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4050.681s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As to why, Mr. President, why there is no accounting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4056.362s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When you get the money from the MWRA ahead of time, before a budget is made, there's an accounting of how that money is going to be spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4063.964s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4073.166s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Biss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4074.577s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe, Mr. President, a Freedom of Information Act can come from anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4078.579s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if the council does not get it as you got it from the response from the finance person, then you would go to that next group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4086.182s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because again, if you follow what Councilor Neider said, if allegedly it comes from the Water and Soil Commission, it's their call, maybe their call to implement it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4093.805s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But it's your call to decide how and where, if it's going to be spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4097.727s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you guys can ask for an accounting of how the money is being spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4103.81s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4104.807s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're more than happy to answer the questions because it's the finances of our community and you can't keep tagging on to Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer and now not having an answer or an explanation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4484.852s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, just on that matter, just to go back and reflect, Demita's had a lifespan of 10 to 12 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4490.826s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know if it's 13 to 15.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4492.986s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But that's a perfect example, a perfect example of when you have a budget that's coming up from the Department of Public Works, having a projection, for example, on new water meters, that dollar amount in anticipation needs to be in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4506.377s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And while it's into the proposed budget that you folks deliberate over, it's likewise the same type of money that can be deliberated over the base fee for which goes in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4517.406s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You back then, Council March, talked about the retained earnings, but the retained earnings,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4521.781s">[Robert Penta]</a>: has to be something that's certified and qualified by the Department of Revenue and subsequently voted upon by the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4528.587s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So taking all of that into consideration, you're dealing with a multi-million dollar surplus right now in your water and sewer account, and you also have inclusive of that multi-million dollar, you're talking about two and a half million dollars right now that's been collected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4543.781s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So how does that fit into either retained earnings or the water and sewer balance<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4549.425s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it off by two and a half minute because this is a new dollar amount in there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4585.77s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in 2016, Mr. President, the deficit was 467,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4587.091s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in 2017, it was 427,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4587.551s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That was on the SOAR account, but that was offset on the opposite side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4596.793s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Council March is talking about because of the retained earnings of the surplus that was in the water and sewer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4601.516s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All I'm saying, all I'm saying is this account, if it's included in your water and sewer account, it should be accounted for and how it's spent or anticipated to be spent, just like any project that's going to be done in the forthcoming year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4615.767s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there was also a dollar amount contained in the budget for unanticipated expenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4620.991s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You may have a street that just blows open, a major line that blows open, I don't know, but the money is there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4626.42s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And lastly, let me just say this, Mr. President, each and every year, I don't know, coming into this year, each and every year, there's been approximately a million dollars in surplus that's left over from the prior year's budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4637.769s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So each and every year for the last maybe 10 to 12 years, there's been approximately a million dollars, and that money, which is left over, once it's certified by the Department of Revenue, it's leftover money, can be used for any unanticipated debt deficit that takes place in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4652.761s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But we don't have to do it because you've got surpluses,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4655.819s">[Robert Penta]</a>: in the water and sewer enterprise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4658.501s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4663.583s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4665.584s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Oh, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2970.61s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do you have to leave the mask on or can I take it off?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2976.834s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2978.175s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Marksley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2979.155s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2979.616s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know if you can hear me, if it makes it any clearer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2982.658s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What Councilor Marksley has alluded to has brought me into this issue of public accounting as to what took place as it related to this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2992.09s">[Robert Penta]</a>: connectivity fee, that's what it was called.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2994.373s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So it was implemented in August of 2017, and for the last three years, it has brought in in excess of $3 million to the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3003.872s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And having that at $3 million and not knowing how and what it's been used for, and if it was going to be an adjunct to the water and sewer system here in the city of Medford, then so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3014.954s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We always get in advance from the MWRA their projected assessment as to what the city is going to be charged for water and sewer charges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3024.136s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that is built in your annual budget each and every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3027.357s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And each and every year since then, the projection that this could be possibly used for a deficit has never happened because we're still dealing with the surplus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3036.084s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I think what Councilman Marks is alluding to is the fact that, you know, if you've collected $3 million, what have you used it for, number one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3044.47s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What do you have projected for its use?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3047.072s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What is the cost for it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3048.893s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And more importantly, if it is separate from water and sewer, so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3053.196s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As we know that you can't take the money from water and sewer because that's considered to be retained earnings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3057.88s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the only way you can get through retained earnings is to the Department of Revenue to get a waiver and 90% of the time that they will give it to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3065.287s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But this is something that has led me after the resolution went on, if you can just bear with me, to other things that unfortunately the council and the public have not been apprised of and brought forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3077.597s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This base fee charge at a minimum of $51.66 annually, that's on the house side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3082.405s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know what the commercial side would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3084.489s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if in fact it's bringing in approximately a million dollars a year, so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3090.143s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you look at your most recent tax bill here in the city of Medford, which is for the third quarter, they implemented a new system with a new vendor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3098.706s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the new vendor has really got this bill basically messed up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3101.867s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's going to be changed because they made a big mistake on it, especially when it gets to the tax itself and it talks about your CPA tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3110.423s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you think about what's going on, and if you think about the taxes here that are going on here in the city of Medford, what can we do to some degree to help the Medford taxpayer as to what's going on and everything that's going on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3123.413s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So what I would like to just introduce to you is something for you to think about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3128.437s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When you look at your water and sewer tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3143.901s">[Robert Penta]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3144.422s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you can look at your water and sewer bill, and if you can look at your tax bill, I'd like to introduce something for the council entertainers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3150.626s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's called a deadline discount program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3154.79s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And a deadline and discount program, which is implemented in a lot of states and a lot of counties, that the month that you get the bill, your tax bill, for example, you get your tax bill in November, and I believe it's due February 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3169.181s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The next one is February 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3171.042s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if you pay it on the month that you receive it, there's a 4% discount on your bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3176.043s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The next month, which would be January, there would be a 3% discount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3180.944s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the city in itself would be getting its money quicker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3184.125s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at the same time, the taxpayer would be getting a break as it relates to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3188.806s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Same thing as it relates to your water and sewer bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3191.306s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you get your water and sewer bill, it's usually six or seven weeks out before you pay it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3196.247s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the month that you get it, or the month before, you get a 4% discount if you pay for it ahead of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3201.368s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a thought, but it does work because it gets the city money quicker before you get it quicker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3207.052s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Pinellas County in Florida, one of many counties, have implemented that and they've shown a marketable increase, a marketable increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3215.271s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Another thing, Mr. President, when we talk about the city's unfunded liability, for which this council, I can go back to 2014, Resolution 214725 was offered by myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3227.906s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that particular resolution asked that on an annual basis, the city of Metra take out of its free cash a minimum<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3234.094s">[Robert Penta]</a>: of $500,000 toward then in fund liability of $29 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3239.976s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I have no idea what the unfunded liability is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3242.316s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I don't think this council has any idea of what the balance is and how much each and every year has been taken out of the budget for the purposes of getting to that unfunded liability, which has to be paid by 2029.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3255.54s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Another thing for which the taxpayers and the council should be aware of waste management.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3261.688s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I don't know if you guys are aware of it, but in March of 2014, then Mayor McGlynn signed an extension, a three-year extension to the waste management contract in the City of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3273.652s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that three-year extension went as follows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3276.353s">[Robert Penta]</a>: For the first year, the City of Medford would get $300,000 in cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3279.734s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The second year, they would get $100,000 more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3281.475s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's $400,000 from 2014 going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3282.435s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the catch to the whole thing was as follows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3291.705s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The amendment was, if you remember correctly, for those who did serve back then, recycling was an issue here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3300.362s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at that point in time, when the contract was signed, we were at 11%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3304.638s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At some point in time, the city worked itself up to a 29% inventory of recycling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3311.601s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But as a result of the city signing off on a three-year extension, what took place there was that the city of Medford allowed waste management, allowed waste management to increase our cost of recycling on an annual basis projected at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3330.978s">[Robert Penta]</a>: $85 per ton, and then it would set itself on an annual basis increase, according to the city of Boston, beginning on July 1st, 2015.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3341.082s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's almost six months, that's almost a good year after the contract was signed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3345.386s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of that, each and every year, the city of Medford has been being charged more for recycling than they had been according to the original agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3354.596s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So for $300,000, $400,000 that the city got paid up front, the cost of recycling has gone forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3362.103s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And once this contract ends in the year 2023, yeah 2023, all the recycling bins, all the recycling bins that the people have in this city will come under the control of the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3373.833s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They'll own it and not waste management.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3376.536s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Another thing that I believe, Mr. President, needs to really be discussed is the CPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3381.44s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Once again, taxpayers on an annual basis are at a cost of approximately $103, according to your household, in the value of your home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3390.427s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, the CPA, as we all know, five years are up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3394.93s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Any time after five years, according to the law, as it's written, that question can go back on the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3401.094s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I would strongly suggest that this council put that question back on the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3405.197s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because when it was first elected in 2015, 1,200 people did not vote on the question because it was on the backside of the ballot, and they didn't know that the question was there to be asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3419.147s">[Robert Penta]</a>: $103, think about that, annually for CPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3422.089s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then you think about the $51 and the connectivity fee, and you put that together with maybe the discounts on paying for your taxes, it would be a great help to the city of Medford and to the taxpayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3432.736s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, Mr. President,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3435.025s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Cable costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3436.065s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Our cable bills from the residents of this community keep going up each and every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3441.087s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They just went up again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3442.848s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But they also have a 5% franchise fee in that cable bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3447.529s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You folks have not got an update on what that increase has brought to the city of Medford and where that money has gone, at least for the last four or five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3456.072s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I know that's something that Councilor Marks had brought up before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3459.373s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then we get to the parking issues, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3474.633s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This presented itself, Mr. President, onto other issues which could be beneficial to the taxpayers, and it would be a public accounting so people could become aware of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3482.655s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor Penta?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3491.977s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, we're almost done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3493.017s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do you mind if I can just figure it out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3494.437s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because it's unfortunate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3495.818s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know something?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3496.678s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're supposed to seize the moment as the moment is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3499.138s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we're talking about the people of our community, what they have to pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3503.039s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, at the same time, if we can offer them a benefit, and at the same time, the City gets a benefit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3507.643s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a matter of being creative and looking at what you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3510.746s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Parking information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3511.746s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You, Mr. President, you have asked on numerous occasions, numerous occasions for a report on how many tickets have been issued, how many have been abated, how much money has been collected, and how much has been given to the City of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3523.496s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Excuse me, none of you can do that because it's never been presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3526.699s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what about the $50,000 that was supposed to go to each and every square here in the City of Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3532.38s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3533.46s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The accounting for the squares hasn't come under any control as to what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3538.741s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And lastly, Mr. President, if we all remember at the inaugural, we were told that seniors in this city would not have to pay any more to park in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3546.943s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That still hasn't come to fruition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3549.044s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's unfair, because you can't make a promise like that and not keep it, because that's what people look at, what your responsibilities are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3557.346s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I say this tonight, Mr. President, as I told you before, taxes pay for what makes this city run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3563.328s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at the same time, the city has a responsibility back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3565.67s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if it can be a two hand, shaken hands compromise, why not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3571.057s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Discounts to your water and sewer bill, discount to your cable bills, finding out where that money went.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3577.301s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And let's get back to the original thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3578.802s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The connectivity fee that was supposed to be helpful here to the city of Medford, you've never had a report where it's going, how much it's brought in, what projects, if anything, and how much it's gonna cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3589.408s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And why should that be considered an adjunct to the Water and Sewer Commission money, when in fact, if you can't project your budget in the future,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3597.453s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Like you're supposed to, and you get your water and sewer estimate ahead of time from the MWRA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3603.083s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We should not be thinking about a deficit when, again, you're just taking more money from the taxpayer without giving them the reason why you took it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3610.389s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd be more than happy to answer any questions, but I would hope that one of you, someone, even would get into the idea of showing and having some kind of a discount in advance for people who pay their taxes and for people who pay their water and sewer bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3624.659s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's out there, it's been a proven fact, and it does work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3627.582s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it'd be a great handshake between taxpayers and the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3630.844s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Paeta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3634.426s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd be more than happy to answer any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3638.628s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3795.796s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3796.997s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, before you call the roll, one quick thing as a notation on the tax bills that come out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3802.279s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You'll notice it says police, fire, and library.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3805.68s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It says 10, 25, 30, whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3808.461s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Whoever checks that, when those bills come out every quarter, I think it would be informative to have next to each one of those items how much money has been donated so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3819.676s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because that would give either an incentive or not for somebody to make a contribution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3823.281s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3868.902s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On the bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3869.422s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay, under each item it'll tell you, they can put in parentheses, that would designate how much money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3914.989s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4805.815s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Summit Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4807.216s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, I want to go back to something that I had said earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4810.318s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would like the council to entertain what they call a deadline and discount program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4815.442s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This would relate itself to your water bills and also to your taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4820.807s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as I said before, it is well practiced in some states and some cities and towns where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4828.112s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On the month that you receive, for example, your tax bill, if you pay it that month, you get a 4% discount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4834.174s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you pay it the next month before the bill is due, you get a 3% discount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4838.556s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Or you wait till the very last day and pay it like a lot of people do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4842.178s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Same thing with the water bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4843.398s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The water bills doesn't have as much of a leeway time between the tax bills when they come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4848.14s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But in the month that you receive the bill, it's usually halfway through the month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4851.441s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you pay it that month, it's a 4% discount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4854.202s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it works well because it's a handshake between the cities and the taxpayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4858.343s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if the taxpayer is looking for a little bit of a break, there it is right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4862.204s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you pay your bill ahead of time, you get a discount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4864.625s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at the same time, the city gets its money to use at a quicker rate for whatever purpose it has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4870.167s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4871.007s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4872.467s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there's no loss to either side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4874.228s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it's a benefit to either side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4875.889s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at the same time,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4877.509s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What you're doing is you're telling the taxpayers, you're basically thinking out for them the best way you can, and you're thinking out for the city the best way you can, because you're giving us the money quicker than we would have gotten if we had to wait almost eight weeks for you to pay your tax bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4891.9s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I would hope someone on the council would entertain it, present it before a committee of the whole for the purposes of discussing it, and moving forward with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4900.103s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4902.424s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It works in other cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4903.445s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It works in other states and other cities and towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4905.905s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as I told you earlier, it's just a way of saying to the taxpayers, we're hearing what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4914.149s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Everybody's got these problems today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4916.21s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We want to help you out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4918.067s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the second thing on the citizen participation, I just don't understand why tax seniors have to pay that once a year $25 tax to park in the city when we were told in January inauguration that the seniors would be able to park for nothing in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4933.387s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That still hasn't happened yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4934.689s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4936.311s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a promise that should have been kept, that needs to be kept, and it's just, once again, it's, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4942.895s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know how the city's operating lately, but all I can tell you is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4945.877s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've got to look for creative ways to keep the people's interest, and at the same time, to keep your own interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4953.022s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what I presented here tonight, I think, is a pretty good handshake with the taxpayers and with the city of Medford as well, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4961.959s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Be more than happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4963.38s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When we talk about money here in the city of Medford, you talk about how the city is going to function.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4970.585s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the city can only function when the taxpayers are willing to pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4973.847s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And sometimes people become delinquent in paying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4976.349s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if they become delinquent, they can't pay it because they don't have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4979.291s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if those people that do have it want to relinquish some of their money quicker,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4983.774s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and get a discount for doing it, it helps the city because they get the money quicker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4987.997s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the last thing I want to say, Mr. President, I think it really needs to entertain itself that the CPA, which is now five years has come and gone, should be looked at about presenting itself on the ballot this November coming in 2021 for the purposes of whether you're going to use it again and re-up it and what have you, because that's what the law says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5005.57s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm not advocating for it or against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5007.292s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What I'm advocating is that the five years are up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5010.195s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The sunset legislation is now in effect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5012.938s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you don't do nothing, it's just going to stay there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5016.261s">[Robert Penta]</a>: 1,200 people in 2015 did not vote on that question because it was on the opposite side of the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5022.348s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They weren't aware it was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5024.17s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So we really have no idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5026.172s">[Robert Penta]</a>: whether it would have passed or it didn't pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5028.474s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This time, I think it would be incumbent if the question goes on the ballot, it's there, and the taxpayers make their decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5034.879s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what it's about, the taxpayers' use of their money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5037.521s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd be more than happy to answer any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5041.625s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Penta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5042.686s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5157.829s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5158.569s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5167.819s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5169.443s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Relative to Councilor Bears' comment, it doesn't make any difference whether it's in-state or out-of-state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5173.986s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's how a city sets its tax rate and how it makes its collections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5178.329s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All I'm making reference to the fact that it works in other states.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5181.852s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5182.893s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe there's a few cities and towns in Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5185.735s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not my call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5186.876s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's only an offering to be made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5188.677s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if it works, as Councilor Marks has alluded to, how can it not work if you're getting your money quicker and you're having a discount paying it ahead of time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5196.683s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's all I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5197.644s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=409.898s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Good evening, my name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, and a former member of the August body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=415.92s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I come here tonight<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=417.987s">[Robert Penta]</a>: To make some comments on issues that I feel are important as it relates to this upcoming budget, from what I understand this administration, and I know the Chief of Staff is here, he can reflect upon the fact that you guys and Lady are going to get an early budget this year, earlier than normal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=435.088s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If that's true, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=436.529s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it true?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=437.628s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So he says we hope so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=438.768s">[Robert Penta]</a>: With that being said, and with two new Councilors on the board, I would just like to reflect upon a couple of things as it relates to what really has not been addressed for the past few months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=449.69s">[Robert Penta]</a>: First of all, going back to last year at some point in time regarding the Lawrence Memorial Hospital, we never got a report back from the auditor's office as it relates to the outpatient surgical offices that are going to be housed<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=465.453s">[Robert Penta]</a>: in the old Lawrence Memorial Hospital as part of an addendum to the 16,000 square foot building that the Lawrence Memorial Hospital is going to have their surgical center at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=475.719s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And with that being said, again, it's just out there floating around not knowing what's going to happen because they haven't made a decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=483.203s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Second of all, it's the taxing of the nonprofit funeral portion<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=488.206s">[Robert Penta]</a>: of the operation at the Gaffey Funeral Home, which houses the Islamic Cultural Center here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=495.068s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And where they're going to be running a funeral business out of that center, once again, it presents itself as a for-profit business within the non-profit structure itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=506.011s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Again, no answers come back on that as of yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=509.192s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And these are issues that I think need to be discussed and resolved before or at least during your budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=515.834s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, let's go back to something that Councilor Caraviello, when he first came on to the Council, talked about, the disrepair of the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=524.222s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At that point in time, Councilor Caraviello indicated during his first term, it was $1.2 million of school repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=530.908s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're now in excess of $1.5 million of school repairs, and we're getting ourselves right into the same position, I shouldn't say ourselves, the city is getting itself into this position<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=541.758s">[Robert Penta]</a>: of why we had to build new schools in the first place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=544.059s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If the upkeep is not going to be taking place, there is something wrong with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=549.401s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The building of a new police station, contained within the building of the new police station, it's 5,000 square feet less than what was asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=557.965s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There is no police firing range that is for qualification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=563.208s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But more importantly, the sad part about the whole thing, no police vehicle is going to be able to be housed internally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=568.91s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're all going to be outside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=571.365s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And by doing that, all you're doing is leaving all your public service vehicles open to the elements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=577.03s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if there's a snowstorm or whatever it might be, every police officer's gonna have to go out there and take the snow off it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=582.034s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you try to explain that to the people of this community and you tell them that you're spending close to $20 million for a new police station, but you have no place to house or at least care for your police cruisers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=594.656s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A very important issue that seems to be lost in the weeds is the, at present, if not more, a $29 million unfunded pension liability that needs to be paid by 2029.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=606.781s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That is yet to be discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=610.322s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, what needs to be addressed right now also is a citywide<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=616.474s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's called the Citywide Home Water Meter Battery Replacement Program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=621.317s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now for those of you that have a house and you know when you get your water and sewer bill, the system was put in well over 10 years ago with meters that were only good for 10 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=631.523s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The 10 years have come and gone, that's a cost factor and that's a replacement that needs to take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=637.446s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We still have yet to receive a cost projection for a new fire station as to where it will be, when it will be, and what it will cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=646.17s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There is no projections out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=648.451s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And still outstanding is the new training tower that was promised it would be built before the old one was taken down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=657.274s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, the old one has been taken down, and now nothing has been put up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=662.116s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in fact, it does affect, in the city of Medford, your home insurance rates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=667.213s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's no financial outline as to how the city's annual free cash should be prioritized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=673.275s">[Robert Penta]</a>: For the new councils coming on board, for the last few many years, it's almost a million dollars each and every year the city of Medford has left over, it just goes into free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=682.278s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So that presents itself with one or two arguments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=684.399s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number one, the budget is either not accurate, or number two, that million dollars is maybe not correct when the budget is being voted upon at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=694.463s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So therefore,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=697.506s">[Robert Penta]</a>: To me, it makes very good sense because a lot of cities and towns do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=701.488s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You folks pass a budget in May or June, let's call it June, that should be the time you set your tax rate, not six months later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=709.672s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if you do that, you're working on an actual annual budget that reflects upon that vote that took place in June that represents itself to each and every dollar itemized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=722.077s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, a public works five-year projection program that covers our streets, our sidewalks, our tree stumps, our equipment, our water repairs issues, and cemetery, as well as all personnel that's gonna be needed to address that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=737.109s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That would be a great program to have because number one, we're already understaffed and we're hiring immediately just two more people to work in the highway department that just basically on a daily basis is so understaffed and on demand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=749.895s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Lastly, for the purposes of at least this portion of the discussion, two points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=756.477s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I know Councilor Caraviello once again has asked for this and Councilor Marks, you've asked for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=760.598s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You should get a five-year financial recap from Park Medford on all the receipts taken in and what has been given to the City of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=768.459s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I guarantee none of you have received anything from Park Medford as it relates to that financial responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=775.501s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And lastly, Councilor Marks, you brought this up, yet to be determined<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=779.182s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where and for what reasons has the $500,000 from Tufts University been accounted for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=785.185s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You still don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=786.245s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We still don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=788.186s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now moving over to the housing issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=791.345s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And here's an issue right now that's in the forefront of everything as to what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=796.447s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So let's just mention a few little things that are going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=800.028s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Right now what we have on the books are 185 units that are coming online after Wendy's on Middlesex Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=807.19s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have 300 plus units opposite the Wellington Station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=811.191s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a proposed 400 Chapter 40B units next to the Middlesex Courthouse on Mystic Valley Parkway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=818.553s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And looking at the smaller neighborhood issue that took place on Forest Street, where a private developer wanted to maximize a single-family residence to a multi-family use zone, that caused a tremendous amount of consultation not only to the neighborhood, but the Medford Historical Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=836.195s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Going back, you go to 61 Toro Street, where you had an old magnificent home over there for which Tufts University was involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=843.243s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they sort of like wanted to take advantage of the property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=846.026s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But through the neighborhood pushing back, that didn't take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=850.475s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Right now, as of tomorrow night, you're going to have before the Board of Appeals, where the old Titan gas station is on Boston Avenue and Harvard Street, a condominium proposed development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=861.519s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then you have rumored development of a new condos behind the Middlesex Avenue Mall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=867.522s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Once again, a rumored development of 30 plus condos on South Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=872.784s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And a rumored Boston Avenue multi-housing development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=878.123s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then, at the end of last summer, 500 multi-use development was proposed by Combined Properties of Malden.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=887.529s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And after a large community opposition, led by then City Councilor and now Mayor, Lungo-Koehn, as well as Gene Nuzzo and Cheryl Rodriguez, the project was forced to be scrapped by the developer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=904.521s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, some six months later,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=907.52s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This same company, Combined Properties, is now proposing a 37, 378 residential unit, and the application for approval is coming along under a Chapter 40B proposal, entirely different than what they originally had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=924.773s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The real wake-up call to this whole issue right now on housing here in the City of Medford should have taken place at 61 Locust Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=932.179s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The massive development that is opposite Wegmans right now, which was originally scheduled for over 500 units, and they've culled it down to 345.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=942.412s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Neighborhood protests pushed it back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=945.033s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But as in any big business development, what did they do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=949.075s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They went into the neighbors that were pushing back and they bought every single home over there for them to at least come back with $345,000 and still make the money that they're going to be made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=960.103s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As I said some years ago, and as I said during this past campaign, the City of Medford needs to embark on a moratorium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=967.685s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A moratorium on its zoning, and more importantly, a complete review of its zoning here in the City of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=975.207s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the reason why the moratorium would work<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=978.311s">[Robert Penta]</a>: is because our zoning has not been reviewed for a multitude of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=982.653s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you're saying to any proposed developer that comes in, I will propose this affordable housing, which is not the same as a Chapter 40B, because remember, affordable housing is something that's compensated in part or given great latitude by state laws, whereas a Chapter 40B is a private independent entity coming in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1004.523s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So sure, they'll give you their affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1007.284s">[Robert Penta]</a>: but they'll back in the cost on the remaining units that are in the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1011.186s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So how does that qualify and justify for an affordable housing process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1015.489s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1016.95s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But also, you should be looking into what they call a growth management proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1023.934s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the reason why I say that is because we have right here in our own city, a sister city, it's called Malden, Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1033.829s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in 2015, they put a question on the ballot, and their ballot question revolved around what you have been talking about, Councilor Falco, the Malden Hospital, what we're going to do with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1045.737s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The second thing is the Community Preservation Act, what are we gonna do with that as far as open space?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1050.98s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And their third question was the moratorium on high-density, multi-level development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1057.564s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It won by 71% of the vote, and they had a moratorium,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1063.834s">[Robert Penta]</a>: proposal that passed and it went from January of 2016 to December of 2017.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1068.516s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now incorporated into that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1076.522s">[Robert Penta]</a>: was the density of the immediate neighborhood taken into consideration, the height, the number of units, as well as the zoning exemptions that were being challenged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1087.07s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of that, they have now, I think if you go to them all, then you can be able to see, if you look at their development office, I don't know if they call it Office of Community Development, they do have a serious situation where they had developers just coming in all over the place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1102.765s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Medford has a serious problem in having a workable business community, a business development community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1110.249s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Approximately 10.2% of the business in this community is commercial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1115.171s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who bears the rest of that brunt?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1117.172s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's the residential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1118.553s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I know every time when you folks turn around and do your budget, you talk about a residential factor making it the highest or the lowest or whatever it might be, you're still putting the burden<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1127.998s">[Robert Penta]</a>: on the taxpayer who owns his residential home, and you're not taking the exemption for the out-of-state person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1133.761s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So, with that being said, and if we continue to go on this road, or this, how can you say, this road, so to speak, of not increasing our commercial base, all you're going to do is just going to be commercial, I mean, raising in the future your residential rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1148.628s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, after what took place in Malden, and after what took place after that, we can switch ourselves over to the city of,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1161.081s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You want somebody else to talk?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1164.744s">[Robert Penta]</a>: OK, well, I'm on my last page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1166.526s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm on my last page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1168.767s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So after Malden, beside Malden, in 2015, the city of Revere, and again in 2018, put that question of a moratorium, high density, multi-use positions over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1179.916s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And their situation over there revolved itself around large scale buildings, traffic, public safety, schools, and roads were going to be at issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1188.163s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the claims that Revere was not growing geographically, but rather becoming more dense without any economic development is just like what's going on right here in our city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1200.088s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And with that being said, that the challenge for affordable housing in Chapter 40B as we speak today,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1205.43s">[Robert Penta]</a>: would be the luxury of using our at-present zoning laws and skirt around the real issue of reasonably priced housing and rental.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1214.596s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There are two or three companies in the United States that take into effect low-moderate housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1221.3s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Veterans<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1223.098s">[Robert Penta]</a>: middle-income people, but not high-end middle-income people, middle-income people, and that's a determination by a professional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1229.963s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We don't have that expertise over here, and I know on the ballot here tonight, on our agenda, there's a question regarding Chapter 40B, but if you really look at just Chapter 40B, and you realize that developer is not there to lose money, and he's putting housing in a densely populated area, you're violating all the reasoning of why a neighborhood should be a neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1253.438s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of that, moratoriums does not have to go on the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1257.602s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A moratorium can be placed by this council, by this mayor, or jointly together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1262.266s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And recognizing the fact, and recognizing the fact, we are a city just as running, allowing housing to be any place and everywhere at any time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1270.152s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And because of that, that's not good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1272.054s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not healthy for the neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1274.136s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As I said before a long time ago, development for the sake of development isn't the best thing that can happen in this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1279.58s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have schools, we have public safety, we have public works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1282.822s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have a whole host of issues that taxpayers have to increasingly pay for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1287.005s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And our best example of that is when they talked about stations landing, that they said at that point in time, that was going to lower our tax rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1293.909s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, the tax rate has never gone down once since station landing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1297.271s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As a matter of fact, it just continuously goes up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1300.794s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd be more than happy to answer any questions, but I just think it's important to have brought this up, especially for our two new councils, but more importantly for all seven of you, because this administration and you as a new council needs to address issues that basically address these matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1318.0s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They haven't been addressed, and they need to be addressed, and you just can't sit here and say, okay, we'll get to it someday, because someday has already come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1327.983s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1331.362s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Larry, could you, I made copies of my comments for all of your Councilors, so in case you missed anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1341.869s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The part that I appreciated the most when I served on this board for 36 years was the fact that I was willing to hear opposite viewpoints.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1351.193s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But when it comes to finances, two and two equals four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1355.534s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when it comes to neighborhoods, the people who live in the neighborhood should come first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1360.056s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Not out-of-towners, not developers who want to come in there and make a whole bunch of money and then leave us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1365.958s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Perfect example is Lumineer on Locust Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1369.139s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They built the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1370.7s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They said they were going to stay there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1372.201s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They went to the Board of Appeals to get what they had to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1374.762s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And one year later, they sold off the building and made $62 million at the expense of the Medford taxpayer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1382.327s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, I thank you for listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1384.868s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if there's any questions, I'd be more than happy to answer them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1395.594s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can I ask a question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3509.89s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3517.376s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Penta, 0 Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3520.078s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm really getting confused on this whole issue right now, because I thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3529.065s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let me just ask this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3530.526s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let me ask just one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3532.127s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And to me, this is where I would be going with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3535.45s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm trying to understand, you're telling me that don't raise the value of land.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3540.412s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you don't raise the value of land, you'll have a better neighborhood or a better atmosphere, so to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3546.174s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So with that being taken, taking place, what you're saying is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3550.936s">[Robert Penta]</a>: ignore zoning because zoning is a big reason why land values go up and if you are going to take out the free competitive spirit of Somebody buying a piece of property and doing what he wants by ignoring the zoning laws that absolutely exist at the present time whether it be for a chapter 40 B or affordable zoning that flies in the face of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3573.656s">[Robert Penta]</a>: of what the petition is all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3575.978s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think what Dr. Starello is basically trying to say, all you're doing is moving the debt from today till tomorrow, and when tomorrow comes, whether it's two today or 10 or 12 or 14, what are you dealing with?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3587.469s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Somebody's gonna wind up paying for it, but in the meantime, it's a cost factor that's being reflected upon everyday taxpayer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3594.014s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So when somebody says that the value of land, don't put it on the value of land,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3599.079s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That seems to be the intrinsic value of how developers seem to come into a community, see the value.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3605.281s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They don't care about the location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3606.821s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They don't care about what the density is going to do with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3609.842s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's your zoning that's gonna predicate the value of land and its use of land and neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3615.804s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's how I read what Councilor Morell just offered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3619.225s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4953.551s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Barpenta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4955.972s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So this is going to reflect back on some of the comments that I made a little bit earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4960.033s">[Robert Penta]</a>: First of all, the City of Medford is a member of the Massachusetts Municipal Association, and they have individuals who are very professional in the housing portion of what we're talking about here right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4971.397s">[Robert Penta]</a>: To go out and hire a private consultant that pushes and advocates for Chapter 40B, I don't think would be a very wise idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4980.424s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Oh, against the 40B.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4981.825s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I thought you said... I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4984.927s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, you may not have to do that because if the Office of Community Development gets itself redesigned, hopefully you would have somebody up there who would understand what the process is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4992.771s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have to understand something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4994.152s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's a difference between Chapter 40B, which does come under a few Massachusetts housing management departments, as compared to affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5004.337s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Affordable housing is usually a private,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5007.779s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But working with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, who to some degree sets some standards up there as it relates to not only affordability, which has to be, but the permanent and perpetuity of having the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5020.091s">[Robert Penta]</a>: the reduced cost unit, whether it be the rental or whether it be the housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5025.694s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Chapter 40B is made for a private developer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5029.536s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He'll come in there and say in the city of Medford, well, you've got to get between, your income level has to be 80% of the medium income in the area that you're applying to put the housing in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5038.642s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if that be the case, you know, we can do that or we'll put 100 units up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5044.456s">[Robert Penta]</a>: 25, 2025, whatever the number's gonna turn out to be, will be affordable, and we'll just raise the cost on the other end of the units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5050.54s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So what did you wind up getting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5052.341s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You really didn't complete anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5055.683s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Me personally, my suggestion would be that the city goes into a complete moratorium on any and all development to take place, because you don't have anything right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5064.228s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a Chapter 40B person who can come in, who just came in right now on Mystic Avenue,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5069.591s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and will bypass your height restrictions and other zoning requirements because that's what 40B is allowed to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5075.919s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you read chapter 69 of chapter 49, excuse me, of chapter 40B, that's what they'll tell you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5084.229s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They can come in and they detour and they go around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5086.972s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I know you guys, Councilor Knight and Councilor Scarpelli, have talked about over the last two or three years, zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5092.296s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So maybe you should hire a zoning consultant right now to figure out how you bring up an update of a 40-year-old zoning that you have here in the city of Medford because every Chapter 40B that comes in here will bypass upstairs and they'll get around it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5105.606s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's the privilege that you have for being a Chapter 40B participant, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5110.589s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if you want to have a Chapter 40B<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5113.231s">[Robert Penta]</a>: be participant that works with the city, then that's what you need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5116.813s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You need to have someone who goes into the neighborhood and sees where the project is going and how is it going to enhance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5122.417s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not gonna produce a density buster.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5125.699s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what you don't want, and that's what's happening right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5128.281s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Density busting all over the city, because private developers know how to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5132.784s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're efficient at doing it, they make it sound good, and what do you have left?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5137.387s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have all these developments all over the place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5140.797s">[Robert Penta]</a>: schools, police, fire, public works, infrastructure, water and sewer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5147.159s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's all affected by this, all affected by this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5150.44s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And while it might sound good that it looks good, that's what you're paying for in your taxes for which our commercial tax rate can't even handle because it's only a 10%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5160.664s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the burden once again is right back onto the residential taxpayer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5165.025s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it's a great idea to get into the discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5168.442s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if you read this case after case after case where cities and towns are so sorry that they went into Chapter 40B because it did not turn out to be what it was supposed to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5178.185s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the fastest way to correct a Chapter 40B problem is to make sure that your zoning speaks for what you want today and for tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5186.767s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's the financial viability of what a community has to deal with as it relates to a Chapter 40B.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5192.409s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Not affordable housing, it's a Chapter 40B.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5195.029s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're in two entirely different requirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5197.97s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Point of information, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5254.154s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, if you go to the city of Somerville, they just went through it for a year and a half.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5257.236s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They stopped, they had a moratorium as it relates to that type of development that took place over there because of what was taking place so fast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5266.301s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They did nothing for that period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5268.442s">[Robert Penta]</a>: as it relates to multi-use development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5274.404s">[Robert Penta]</a>: To the best of my, to moratorium, so that means you can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5277.205s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Another point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5290.871s">[Robert Penta]</a>: One of the things that a Chapter 40B does tell you, if they go before a Board of Appeals, if the Board of Appeals feels, this is the term that they use, and it's not a friendly Chapter 40B, that's the term, friendly, they can shoot that down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5306.196s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, what determines to be friendly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5309.157s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It could be public health, it could be public safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5311.678s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Those are the two biggest issues that you'd have going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5314.879s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Other than being in a residential neighborhood and making it high density,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5318.953s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's a subjective thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5320.194s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's all I can tell you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5322.055s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if you are going to hire somebody, or Office of Community Development is going to employ somebody, consultant or otherwise, that's the first thing I would address, because you have such archaic laws, you can go to the Board of Appeals right now and come in and make a proposal, and you can't shoot it down, because YDB will allow you to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5343.814s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's an interesting concept and the city of Medford really needs to address it because you've gone at a fever pitch over the past many years with all kinds of development and there's no checks and balances to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5358.449s">[Robert Penta]</a>: 61 Locust Street is really the issue that should bring this all to a head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5362.713s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It should have brought it to a head then when they wanted to put 500 units there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5366.676s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay, and what did they do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5368.499s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The big developer went in there and bought out the neighborhood, bought out every single house in the neighborhood, and they reduced it to 345, which the Board of Appeals allowed, and it managed to put itself through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5391.19s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe that the reason, I believe Councilor, the reason why the city lost is because the neighborhood agreed to the reduction of $345,000 after they all got bought out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5401.379s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So our suit was completely moved at that point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5422.466s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But they felt it had zero standing, but also the then mayor at the time refused to give additional money to go forward with the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5431.493s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You could have appealed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5454.052s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I also believe, Mr. President, when you lost the issue on standing, it was a moot issue, because all the people, the residents, pushed back on the lawsuit, because they all got bought out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5464.315s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the standing for which the council had was not being supported by the neighborhood, which initiated the lawsuit in the first place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5472.076s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the council got originally $20,000 in the beginning to get the case going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2668.477s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2670.351s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2671.753s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert M. Pentez, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of this party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2675.557s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, the world is in a changing state of times right now, and I think what Councilman Marks has introduced is something that could be epidemic anywhere in this country, but it's not the first time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2685.229s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's been here before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2686.69s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, you as Councilors, you have a 50 percent voice in the school department budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2691.653s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you see something that's not taking place in their budget, for example, under school security, and here's a prime example of what school security is all about, this is the opportunity to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2701.057s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If the school committee knows that the city council is with them and trying to help them, that's a great leadership quality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2707.501s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I don't think anybody in any municipal or state or federal capacity should sit back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2712.043s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you've got something to say that revolves around security,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2714.683s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Say it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2715.003s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what you're getting paid for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2716.423s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what the people expect from you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2718.924s">[Robert Penta]</a>: With that being said, Mr. President, not only do I think it's a good movement, I think it would be wise, as a suggestion being offered to the school committee, that they review their entire policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2730.526s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now, knowing that they're going to be having a new superintendent as of June or at the end of May or whatever it might be, if not sooner, whatever the situation might be, here's an opportunity to start to clean house on issues that are really of a concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2743.352s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe the gun clip said something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2746.053s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the review of the policy is what it's all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2749.533s">[Robert Penta]</a>: People in the building that nobody knows nothing about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2752.234s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think it's a good motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2754.755s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I would hope the council votes approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4471.125s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Pentez, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4474.406s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The stress and anxiety of Clipgate, that's what I call it, Clipgate, has needlessly caused our city an embarrassed showing for collective management when they thought nobody was looking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4485.85s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Dating back to December 28th, when the ammo clip was first found,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4490.832s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A cast of characters have become principal components to the investigation, starting with the cleaning company personnel who first found the clip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4500.034s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have further parties of interest in the school custodian, Mr. Edwards, the principal at the McGlynn School, Mr. Belson, the school superintendent, the resource officer, Medford police officer, Riccati, Mr. McLaughlin, director of building and grounds, Mayor Burke, and school employees who brought this to the attention of Councilor Lungo-Koehn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4521.859s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When Councilor Lungo-Koehn notified the police on Thursday, December 15th, of this concern brought to her attention by school employees, the school building was swept on Tuesday, February 20th, according to news reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4535.225s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thankfully, Breanna Lungo-Koehn and Councilor Marks addressed this matter at their next council meeting with many concerned parents in attendance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4543.889s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This past Thursday, February 22nd,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4546.573s">[Robert Penta]</a>: at the Karen Little Theater at Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4549.434s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Seven days after Breonna Lungelkorn notified police, the mayor called for a school committee meeting wherein hundreds of Medford citizens, teachers, and administrators attended to discuss the matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4561.997s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When Mayor Burke, as chairperson of the school committee, first found out about this matter, and from whom and what did she do, she has yet to disclose that matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4571.714s">[Robert Penta]</a>: While the February 22nd meeting revealed a lot of anger and displeasure as to what the Clipgate incident has caused, it also revealed shortcomings to questions asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4584.843s">[Robert Penta]</a>: One glaring question, and yet to be answered, was, who was the we that decided not to share the info at the outset?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4593.908s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The Medford Police, under the direction of Chief Sacco, is leading the in-house investigation regarding this incident, as he should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4601.664s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If the Medford police are good enough to investigate a murder, stolen property, drug dealing, and other crimes within their daily jobs, they now don't need to be upstaged by the mayor and her hiring of her close, personal, and financially rewarding political friend, Martha Coakley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4620.247s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mayor Burke, on her own, without any discussion, approval, or vote of record from the school committee, has hired her close personal friend, former Attorney General Martha Coakley, who has contributed $1,000 to Mayor Burke's campaign to do this independent personnel investigation because of this matter as it's reported in the news reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4643.868s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This independent personnel investigation should have no ties nor relationships to any politicians in our cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4652.535s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I ask, where is the transparency to this matter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4655.898s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Independent means just what it says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4659.02s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Free and devoid from any influence, guidance, or counsel of another or others, nor affiliated with or loyal to no one political party, organization, or voter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4670.767s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Both Mrs. Burke and Mrs. Coakley are both Democrats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4674.67s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This hiring of Martha Coakley by Mayor Burke is a sole source contract, a contract awarded without competitive bidding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4684.476s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It directs itself to cronyism, particularly in awarding jobs to friends or trusted colleagues in politics between politicians.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4694.375s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This hiring also prevents presents, excuse me, a serious question as to whether Mayor Burke has violated the state ethics law on the chapter 62.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4704.318s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 268A, wherein the law states if a conflict is apparent, or the appearance is a telling sign, then a violation of the law is readily at hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4716.627s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A public employee may not act in a manner that would cause a reasonable person to think that she would show favor toward someone or that she can be improperly influenced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4728.535s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I stand here not to question the ability or the capability<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4733.222s">[Robert Penta]</a>: of Martha Coakley, but rather the concern of a state ethics conflict of interest, as well as to her individual unspecified cost from her very expensive downtown Boston law firm of Foley and Hogue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4748.798s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mayor Burke's relationship with Martha Coakley has been long and financially rewarding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4754.15s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I find it interesting that Mayor Burke is now concerned with having an independent personnel investigation, but where is her outside independent audit of the school department if she is so concerned about righting the ship?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4767.832s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I do not believe we need a very expensive, close, personal, and political friend of the mayor to address Medford's employee personnel policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4777.495s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Medford is a good city with tons of good people in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4781.156s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let this incident be the thoughtful reminder that when the law is not followed and protocols are not in place, and when city leaders take it upon themselves to make decisions that fly in the face of potential safety and what the law says,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4797.221s">[Robert Penta]</a>: then all involved, no matter who, as this case has demonstrated, shall be held accountable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4804.826s">[Robert Penta]</a>: For the truth only has one consequence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4808.468s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let no cover-up be worse than the crime itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4812.73s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would like to conclude by making a correction to a statement I made last Thursday at the school committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4819.743s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At the conclusion of my commentary and in my haste, I misread what I meant to say, and it was as follows, what I meant to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4828.807s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What happened in Florida was horrific, and hopefully we all have learned something here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4834.269s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The people of Medford want action, and as city officials, you owe it to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4839.411s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, with that being said, Mr. President, again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4843.374s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You folks have been through the whole issue of conflict of interest, whether it be your pay raises or jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4849.616s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is a very serious matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4852.077s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This hiring of Mrs. Coakley out of the Clear Blue Sky, while this incident is going on, I believe does not speak well for the police investigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4862.041s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think it speaks well for the Medford Police Department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4864.722s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They can handle their own investigation, and if it turns out to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4867.505s">[Robert Penta]</a>: something on one of their own, they will resolve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4870.128s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If it's something that's resolved here in the building, an employee, it will be resolved internally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4875.435s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if the need is to have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4877.934s">[Robert Penta]</a>: an updated personnel policy that hasn't taken place since this mayor has come into being, well then so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4885.06s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But to hire someone who paid you, strike that, who gave you $1,000 in political contributions, smacks with the theory that this is directly a conflict of interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4897.591s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this is a sole source contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4899.893s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There was no need for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4901.821s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There was no need to go out with no competition, no bidding on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4905.043s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This wasn't a serious emergency that needed to be done and nobody could be contacted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4909.825s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I really think it needs to be reviewed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4912.166s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think the city solicitor needs to review it with you council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4915.067s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would hope someone on the council would ask that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4918.449s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why did the mayor go ahead and do it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4919.649s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The mayor hasn't even notified you fellas and you yet that she's hired Mrs. Coakley for this particular purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4926.578s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to do this investigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4928.279s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know how much she charges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4929.819s">[Robert Penta]</a>: People say she charges $500 an hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4932.16s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, how many hours is she going to go for and how long is this going to go on for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4936.022s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The taxpayers of this community need to know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4938.663s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this issue of her being hired should not be disguised because of this ammo gate that's going on here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4946.106s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They are two separate issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4949.227s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the mayor needs to respond and answer that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4952.411s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Was she part of the we that made the decision not to disclose the information, dating back as early as December 28th and bringing it up to February 15th when Councilor Longo-Curran brought this to everybody's attention because of people bringing it to her attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4967.842s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, if you remember closely what the Chief said when the question was asked of him about the picture with the clip with the gun, because I was the one that asked him, where did you get that picture, Chief?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4978.45s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he says he got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4980.046s">[Robert Penta]</a>: from the Director of Buildings and Grounds, Mr. McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4983.468s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I gave you seven people in the beginning that start this whole thing going that have to be interviewed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4988.25s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Possibly every single elected official probably should be interviewed and asked a question, because maybe some of you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4993.393s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe some of you have been told something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4994.954s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4996.115s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you know something?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4996.895s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a very serious incident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4998.776s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Last Thursday night, up at that high school, there were so many people that were so impassioned as to what they were saying that sometimes it just looked like it might have or it could have gotten out of hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5010.32s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But logic and common sense and calmness has to take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5015.043s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We all know now that there is an issue out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5017.585s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We all know that allegedly it was thrown away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5020.666s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We don't know if it was thrown away, if it was misplaced, somebody took it, somebody got rid of it, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5026.41s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The police report, the police investigation will prove that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5029.912s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But while all that's going on, to hire another paid outside consultant, because that person is a political personal friend of the mayor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5040.195s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My God, come on, folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5041.597s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, there's got to be some checks and balances here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5045.842s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5046.163s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If it looks like a duck and walks like a duck and smells like a duck, it probably is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5049.647s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Chapter 268A, that's what it says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5052.03s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can't give the appearance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5053.532s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this definitely not only gives the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5056.556s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've got the $1,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5057.697s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've got the contributions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5059.377s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And she's not only contributed to this mayor, she's contributed to other mayors and other people in this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5065.5s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5066.721s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not being independent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5069.122s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's saying pay to play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5071.303s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if that's what's going to go on here, then shame on this city and shame on elected officials for allowing this to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5077.026s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I would hope Mrs. Coakley would give a second thought about this and say, well, while it was nice to be asked, I think it would be better for the city of Medford to find someone<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5086.35s">[Robert Penta]</a>: who has absolutely no connections if they really want to do an independent policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5090.596s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You folks are all part of the Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5092.418s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Municipal Association.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5093.419s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They have a huge department in there to review personnel purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5096.964s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5097.705s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're a paying member on an annual basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5100.148s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You should have gone to them first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5102.393s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But to turn around in this situation and disguise it because of what happened with the ammo clip and go out there and hire a Methodist lawyer from one of the most expensive law firms in Boston, and you don't even know what it's going to cost you, it makes no sense at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5118.5s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would hope one of you somewhere along here puts a request in to have a report as to how and why she was hired, how much is she getting, and if, in fact, this is a conflict of interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5129.285s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5910.783s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5911.724s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let me address the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5912.925s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Zero Summit Road, Barpenta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5914.647s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number one,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5916.317s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As outlined in the local press and in the Boston news media, she was hired, Martha Coakley was hired by the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5922.779s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This vote never took place, it was never presented before the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5926.301s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, wait a minute, I'm just telling you, if you can check it out, it was never presented before the, it was never presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5932.143s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was never presented, Rick, before the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5934.384s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's no official vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5939.413s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If it's hearsay, never mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5944.395s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can I ask you to amend the resolution that reads, well, maybe you don't like it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5950.456s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can leave if you're bored.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5952.777s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe you can ask the question that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5955.815s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're concerned about the ethics of it because of the fact of the financial contributions she has made to the mayor, and that in and of itself presents a conflict of interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5966.517s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The appearance of a conflict of interest, that's what 268A says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5973.018s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what we're asking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=6079.932s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=6080.813s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, just as a point of reference, on February 23rd it was written in the Boston Herald and where the mayor is quoted as saying that Martha Coakley is now an employee being hired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4700.656s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4707.421s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, former member of the Saga's party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4712.095s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm going to piggyback on what Cheryl talked about, but I'm more to the process more than anything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4717.72s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Um, this was a, the September meeting of the board of appeals was continued to the October meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4722.744s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And once the meeting was continued to the October meeting, um, it was noticed out that the some of all Alderman didn't have enough time, um, to prepare what he needed to prepare.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4732.032s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So he wanted to be allowed to speak in the October meeting for which he was, I believe four of members of the council were there, expressed their opinion that the members, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4740.731s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They had received emails and telephone calls regarding folks that weren't notified, did not get the notice, and they just heard about it on this particular night, and they rushed down there to come to this October meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4751.1s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was at the discretion of the chairman of the board, Mr. Carman, who indicated that public comment was closed because the September meeting had come and gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4762.029s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, that's not particularly correct either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4766.613s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The meeting was continued, and when the meeting was continued,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4769.911s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At the time when the chairman asked for a raise of hands, those who might be opposed, and I believe he said, let the record say there were 10, at that point he opened up that meeting for public participation by the raise of the hands, because he noticed it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4784.739s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He also said that they couldn't speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4786.88s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, if you're asking for their participation by raising their hands, but they couldn't speak, you really don't know the reason why they were opposing it, because maybe they would have been convinced<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4797.814s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that they would be far if they wanted to get their particular point across, which unfortunately I never had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4803.641s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So then you go to four particular issues that I think were really prevalent at that particular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4812.17s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The first one was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4814.083s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The zoning on parking spaces, Somerville and Medford are very different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4817.665s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Somerville has 1.0 per parking unit, Medford has 2.1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4822.127s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No discussion on that at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4824.027s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The next issue was the sun being blocked on the streets that are abutting this particular project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4830.39s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a legitimate concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4831.571s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have the same issue here on High Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4834.738s">[Robert Penta]</a>: when they were building the new condominiums next to St.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4836.639s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Joseph's Church.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4837.779s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there's legal cases and legal precedent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4840.36s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If someone's sunlight is being blocked by a building, and in this particular case, you're asking for variances to a particular project, which is over and beyond just a normal building, that has legal precedence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4853.563s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, they didn't talk about the fact that Cheryl alluded to the facts on this mixed-use piece of property that could be put together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4862.97s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, in the city of Medford, we do not allow for spot zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4866.211s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's one of the arguments that's taking place on Locust Street right now, the argument of a possible spot zoning issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4873.333s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That didn't even have an opportunity for public discussion as it relates to the fact that, you know, is it or isn't it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4879.434s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the mixed use combination of mixed use of commercial and residential, beside not having its opportunity to have a conversation, did not even have its opportunity for the Board of Appeals to say, if we're going to entertain that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4892.037s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's obvious that it's a mixed zone, I mean, it's a spot zone issue, which is in violation of the law or the spirit of, not the spirit, of the Massachusetts general law here in the city of Medford that's promulgated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4903.261s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've got an issue here as it relates to the developer and what he needs to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4907.382s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, Councilor Dello Russo alluded to the fact that the board is not political.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4910.923s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It most certainly is political because all three members of the board are appointed by the mayor of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4915.925s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the request that was just made earlier by Councilor Longo relative to asking the mayor<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4921.493s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to ask the board to let people speak on and beyond, over and beyond, is absolutely on target.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4928.017s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And more importantly, you can say what you want about the prior Board of Appeals when Mr. Arena was the chairperson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4933.421s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He always allowed every single person to speak, never mind once, sometimes twice, because he recognized whether you agreed or disagreed with his decision, if people took the time to be there and have a conversation about the project that's before them, then let them speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4948.411s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that was not the situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4951.093s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I almost had the distinct honor of having the police called on me by the chairperson, because I asked him, and I begged him three separate times, would you please let the people speak?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4959.898s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he says, no, no, he can't, because the time has already come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4962.759s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We've already had it in September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4964.62s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And through his reckless act, and that's what I call it, reckless, he canceled the whole meeting, which was the last two petitioners that were on there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4971.483s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They didn't even have an opportunity to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4974.025s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, the law is somewhat clear, but it's also somewhat fuzzy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4979.647s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In the open meeting law, in the guidelines promulgated by the Attorney General, it does say, it does give the distinction to the chairperson or the chair of the committee to allow people to speak at that person's discretion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4991.535s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But it also says at the very end by the Attorney General, the Attorney General encourages public bodies to allow as much public participation as time allows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5001.661s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This was eight o'clock at night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5003.482s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Nobody was falling asleep in this audience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5005.724s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They were here because for a particular purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5009.114s">[Robert Penta]</a>: as much public participation as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5011.556s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And for that chairperson to shut off public participation and hear what was on people's minds was wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5018.864s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This same chairperson served as an alternate last year when the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Attorney General Office came in and told the Board of Appeals that they had to reopen the board because they were wrong in closing down a meeting that was in a continued meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5034.089s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, if this Board of Appeals doesn't want to understand the law and follow the guidelines by the State's Attorney General, then maybe we need a new board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5042.615s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe when you change the charter, we should have the Board of Appeals be elected instead of appointed that way there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5048.399s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe that would be the safest way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5050.521s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Neighborhood character and neighborhood future buildings be protected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5054.363s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5055.585s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You guys and ladies on this council, your biggest responsibility over the budget is zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5060.628s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What takes place in a community by its zoning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5063.769s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can talk about it all you want, you can advertise it all you want, but people are saying nothing's taking place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5069.392s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This community has changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5070.973s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're in the middle of a lawsuit, they're suing the developer on Locust Street in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5076.136s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've gone to Miloka Street, you've gone to Middlesex Avenue, you've gone to Salem Street, and now you're over here in South Medford on Medford Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5082.959s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And one of the other arguments that were brought forth is the traffic going to be deposited onto the Medford Street, and Medford Street, as we all know, is a cut-through street to Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5092.382s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are all legitimate concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5094.783s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This isn't to say whether you're for or against the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5097.504s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's the concerns that the people wanted to talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5101.265s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when you shut the people off at the pass, that's why they have no respect and they don't believe in their government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5108.028s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's why it's incumbent upon you as city councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5110.689s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've been talking about it for two years, about changing your zoning, and you haven't done it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5114.69s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So whoever of you get re-elected, you should make that your priority, along with the new members of the council, that zoning is the number one priority, because you've seen what it's doing to this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5124.332s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've seen the character of neighborhoods being totally disrupted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5128.213s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you can't say it's not political when every member on the board is appointed by a political person, and that's the mayor of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5136.26s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if you want to have clean hands and let the neighborhood and let the taxpayers make that decision, because good zoning might be predicated upon people who get elected rather than people get appointed, that might set the tone in a different direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5149.651s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And just lastly, I want to say this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5152.374s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is Halloween.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5153.074s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is trick-or-treat night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5154.636s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And some of you have young children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5156.416s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it would have been a good call by you, Mr. President, to delay the meeting by at least an hour to let whoever had children to go out and trick or treat with their family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5164.184s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You still could have accomplished the city council meeting and we wouldn't be in the chaos that we're in right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5176.997s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when was that, sir?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5182.202s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe you have 48 hours to change that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5184.083s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've had that since last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5185.784s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But other than that, I'd be more than happy to answer any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5188.066s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But how do you say it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5191.728s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There aren't too many things that you guys and girls really have super control over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5197.091s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Budget, voting it up and down, but zoning, it's all yours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5200.313s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You own it, lock, stock, and barrel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5202.734s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Use it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5203.815s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Don't let the administration abuse it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5205.876s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You guys and girls use it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5208.148s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6108.577s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just as a further point, just as a further point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6113.499s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, I can appreciate the developer coming here to make the comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6116.6s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But these comments were not made at the public hearing, for which a whole bunch of people, almost 100 in total, were here on that night, whether they were from Somerville or from Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6125.543s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Arguing the case here tonight with only a few of the residents is not the right way to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6131.025s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The issue on the sun, the issue on the barrels, that's all well and good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6134.526s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But we have four people here right now that have never heard it for the first time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6138.127s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You folks have taken it upon yourself to bring a suit against a developer on Locust Street because you were dissatisfied because the neighborhood was not addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6147.244s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Four of you just attended this past meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6149.841s">[Robert Penta]</a>: this past October 24th meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6151.763s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would strongly suggest that the four of you, if not seven of you, make a request to the Board of Appeals to ask them to delay any finality to making a decision and to reopen a public hearing to listen to all the stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6165.874s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because it's obvious that they didn't have a chance to listen to the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6174.141s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, he can have all the meetings he's want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6176.322s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm talking about the Board of Appeals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6178.604s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As Mrs. Rodriguez just said, they're scheduled to make a final determination first week in November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6185.308s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There are two official complaints being filed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6187.77s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if they don't respond to them, it goes to the Attorney General's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6191.092s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, do you really want to go that far?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6193.534s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Or we can resolve it by maybe having the board, seven of you, respectfully request the Board of Appeals to delay any further action and to reopen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6208.042s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm asking a council Lungel Curran.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=201.815s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, um, on this address to the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=204.376s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Penta zero summit road, former member of this board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=206.876s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Um, whether it be this question or the next one, it is maybe the terminology is wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=212.778s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It says medical cost is 5,000, but in the narrative it says medical bills are in excess of 6,500.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=219.68s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Could that be just explain why it's five and not 65 the next day about the next one is the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=248.068s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then the question is, under the term other, can you just explain, this is for clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=252.25s">[Robert Penta]</a>: For the purposes of other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=253.39s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Could she have collected the difference of 15?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=255.071s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Point of order, Councilor Nate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=264.269s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Your common practice is to allow people to speak at the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=267.271s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The Assistant City Solicitor is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=268.891s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She's willing to answer the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=270.132s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know what his problem is tonight, but if he wants to keep disrupting me every time I speak, he can show his rudeness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=275.695s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The Solicitor would— What is the gentleman suggesting that's problematic?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=289.822s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What's problematic, Councilman Knight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=291.723s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Pardon me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=294.199s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What does that mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=295.1s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm sure it's the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=297.181s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You better rest your case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=298.622s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can you answer that please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=301.684s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm sorry, what was the question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=302.665s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The question on other, what does other mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=306.608s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Could you take the money from other in terms of picking up the difference?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=315.354s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=315.654s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On the chapter 84, you said the max is $5,000, but to get over and beyond that, there's a term there called other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=321.258s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is there any other way?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=322.498s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to get that person up to the 6,500?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2806.831s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of this August body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2813.676s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I come here to address the City Council on this important issue that has important but different consequences depending on what side of the issue that you might be on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2826.145s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At the outset, I want to address and thank Curtis Tudin for propelling this issue<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2831.714s">[Robert Penta]</a>: before our citizens of the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2834.415s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Since this is an election year and we're all running for office, those of you that are and those that might be candidates running for office, boasting about all the wonderful accomplishments and the hard votes that you had to take.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2847.181s">[Robert Penta]</a>: To me, this is a very important issue and I think it's an issue that needs to be presented and discussed and to have everybody, including the mayor, the city council, the school committee, take a position on this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2857.449s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because isn't it weird, when we think about our America today, and you see all the things that are taking place, whether it's before the National Football League, or little Pop Warner kids, the use of our American flag, the national anthem, seems to be at issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2875.734s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And our culture seems to be at issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2879.355s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But where are we going with all of that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2881.396s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2882.496s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Sanctuary City's had its beginning here in the United States back in the 1980s.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2886.778s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Central folks, central people from Central America left their country looking for political refuge because of the oppressive nature that was taking place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2896.962s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what took place here in this country, and the churches, many of the churches throughout this country, they took these folks in, believing them to be in need of help, and for which we did, we helped them out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2909.821s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But that sort of like has morphed itself since 1981 to what it is today, addressing itself to sanctuary cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2918.967s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of sanctuary cities becoming what they are and having a different interpretation, you, Mr. President, just read something that was dated November 21, 2016.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2931.756s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you go to that third whereas, it says the city of Medford stands in support of all immigrant groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2937.7s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think the word before all,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2939.83s">[Robert Penta]</a>: an immigrant should be legal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2941.791s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All legal immigrant groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2944.051s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because we, the people of the United States, are a nation built on laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2949.533s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Its foundation is built on laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2952.014s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's on the legality of what we do each and every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2955.535s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it seems, and it seems that because of all this illegal immigration that is taking place in this country, you know, have we as a country now forgotten the fact or gotten to the point where everybody has a right<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2969.155s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're giving everybody rights, but nobody wants responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2973.497s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the responsibility that's being borne each and every day is the Mr. and Mrs. America, Mr. and Mrs. Medford taxpayer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2981.141s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, I cannot think of any prouder comment than something that's written on the banner of the VFW of Mystic Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2992.607s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It says, all lives matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2996.315s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Everybody's lives matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2998.617s">[Robert Penta]</a>: White, black, blue, green, I don't care what nationality you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3002.46s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you're here in this country, and you're here legally, or you have the proper legal documents, earning your way to become an American citizen, your life matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3011.847s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And for those folks that come here illegally, that's in and of itself the question that's before us right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3020.586s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We as a community are very generous to so many people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3024.389s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You members on the council, especially your two new members, Councilor Scarpel and Councilor Falco, you've just gone through two years of community block grant funding, and if you go through each and every one of those community block grant fundings, you will see the amount of money that's been dedicated and prioritized to charities within not only the city of Medford, but in the Tri-City and outside the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3046.085s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've also seen monies go to legal, council,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3050.216s">[Robert Penta]</a>: for people who have an illegal immigration condition needing to get itself resolved and coming forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3059.158s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We also have in this community all our churches and all the food pantries and the shelters taking care of as many people as they can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3068.241s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And while they're doing that, the question then becomes, who comes first, the illegal or the legal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3076.423s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think a sanctuary city, in and of itself,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3080.219s">[Robert Penta]</a>: presents that particular situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3082.541s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Like I said, again, depending on what side of the issue you're on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3086.983s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Sanctuary cities throughout this country, and there's 200 of them right now, that bar the use of government resources to enforce federal immigration laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3096.99s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they also allow illegals charged with crimes to be released without notifying federal authorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3104.775s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, in a report that was submitted in December of 2014 to Congress,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3109.591s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It stated that more than 30,000 convicted criminals have been released by ICE at the end of 2014, and they have gone back to the states, to the cities and towns that they came from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3122.019s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But inclusive of those crimes,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3125.196s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There was 173 homicides, there were 373 sexual assaults, there were 186 kidnappings, and there was 1,000, excuse me, there was 14,014 drunk driving charges to individuals that did not have a license.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3131.558s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There were more than 30,000 convicted criminal citations issued during that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3152.065s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What does that say to the law abiding citizen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3154.887s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But more importantly, what does that say to law enforcement personnel?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3161.69s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who especially now, if you're in a sanctuary city, you can't ask for identification as to are you an immigrant or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3169.214s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can't hold them, you can't call ISIS, excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3175.064s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It has a ramification that just really says to the police officer of today, beside doing my job for the city that I'm in, I am now having to become aware of somebody who might be here illegally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3190.393s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that person might get preferential treatment over someone who might be here legally, but that I can arrest and imprison.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3197.977s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's really not right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3200.609s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's a particular case that takes place from a gentleman and his two children that died.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3206.651s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He came from Levone, Texas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3209.112s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he was hit by an illegal immigrant who hit him head on in a collision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3214.134s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he killed him, his four-year-old son, and his 22-month-old, strike that, his four-year-old daughter and his 22-month-old son.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3223.017s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The illegal person was arrested and plea bargained to a two-year sentence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3231.283s">[Robert Penta]</a>: a two-year sentence for wiping out a husband, a father, and a daughter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3237.404s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The woman, subsequent to that, has had some kind of public, how could you say, retaliation, because she felt that the justice system didn't do her right, because she complained because of that, and the person that killed her husband, her daughter, and her son was Hispanic, she now becomes the culprit and not the victim.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3260.455s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are just little nuances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3262.236s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We can go to the entire country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3264.318s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There are cases where police officers have been killed, shot, brutally murdered by illegal immigrants here in this country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3272.303s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's not right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3273.364s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Absolutely not right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3276.386s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When we think about what's going on, illegals, they have the benefits of our free medical system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3283.071s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They go to our quality schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3285.352s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They get free housing and free food.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3287.614s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But they don't choose to blend in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3289.653s">[Robert Penta]</a>: by learning English and assimilating to our American culture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3294.835s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And further, by committing crimes outside or inside the community or the state that they're in, it adds a definite cost to our police, to our public safety, to our public education, and to Mr. and Mrs. Medford and Mr. and Mrs. America.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3313.123s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the question then becomes, on a sanctuary city, you folks are running for office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3318.615s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I haven't seen one of you yet say or put anywhere in your literature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3322.816s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just one gentleman so far, he's in the back of the room, made the point that he is for sanctuary cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3330.099s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I commend him for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3331.119s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He took his position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3333.26s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a very important issue to be discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3337.961s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because if you're telling me that you're abiding by this November 16th, strike that, November 23rd,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3346.365s">[Robert Penta]</a>: resolution, well, this smacks of all the ingredients of a sanctuary city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3351.129s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Either we are or we're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3354.292s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think you councilors and every candidate running for office needs to take that position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3359.656s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the reason why they need to take that position, whether you're for or against, in a common level headed society, while we don't have to agree, we can respectfully disagree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3371.752s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's where I think we need to be going here in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3375.515s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, when you say we're a welcoming community, as a matter of fact, there's a billboard coming in on Route 93.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3381.379s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It says we are a welcoming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3382.88s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We've always been a welcoming committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3384.661s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We've got the third largest black population in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and we've had it for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3391.326s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And slowly but surely, they're leaving because nobody can afford to stay there anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3395.129s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The cost of housing in this community has gone completely out of control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3398.872s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Makes no sense at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3400.868s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if this present administration keeps wanting to put housing all over the place, and if this council doesn't want to review zoning, that's what's going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3408.572s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can have a city so out of control, you're not going to be able to understand what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3412.474s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And Dr. Stirella was right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3413.995s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Your finances will be so out of control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3416.656s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you add a sanctuary city to the mix, then please explain why you're doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3422.399s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And please let the people know as a candidate for office that a sanctuary city, you're either for it or against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3428.729s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Panto, we're running, you're running over your time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3441.36s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think the bottom line, my comment would basically, I don't think any city council, any mayor, any school committee person or anyone<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3450.615s">[Robert Penta]</a>: should tell a police department how to do their job, especially whether they're legal or illegal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3457.244s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's their job to protect and to serve, and not to be controlled by a political hierarchy in a community that turns around and says, we want to be a sanctuary city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5725.656s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5725.976s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Penteciro, Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5729.079s">[Robert Penta]</a>: First of all, for the young lady to my behind me,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5733.038s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm not a white privileged individual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5735.439s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I've had to work for everything in my life, starting at five o'clock in the morning for eight consecutive years, driving a canteen truck, being held up three times, shot at twice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5747.925s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I didn't give up because I knew what I wanted to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5751.327s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I wanted to get a college education and go forward with my life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5755.629s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's what I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5756.89s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I did not come here tonight to be decisive or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5762.048s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Have people become decisive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5763.531s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I came here tonight to present an issue, thanking Mr. Tudin, who made the acknowledgement that he is for a sanctuary city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5771.745s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a subject matter that needs to be discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5775.236s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The statistics that were given are actual statistics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5778.838s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can't get away because they're not lying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5781.899s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And for the other lady who indicated that the crime rate for the individuals who are undocumented are less than regular American citizens that are documented and are legal, that in and of itself spells to the question of the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5798.487s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're doing more work because they have to deal with undocumented illegals over and beyond their regular course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5806.214s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, are all of them bad people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5808.696s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Absolutely not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5809.897s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do they deserve a fair shot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5812.239s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5814.298s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if they have to have some political intervention, which is taking place right now in Washington, so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5820.324s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the fact of the matter is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5822.566s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I stand here and I resent the fact that anyone, any seven of you or anyone in this audience, who wants to turn around and say, because I was born white, that I am privileged, that is false, that is wrong, and that is a lie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5835.519s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you should be ashamed of yourself for saying that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5838.321s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2122.993s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford Mass, former member of this August body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2129.818s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I come here to address the City Council on this important issue that has important but different consequences depending on what side of the issue that you might be on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2142.287s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At the outset, I want to address and thank Curtis Tooden for propelling this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2147.877s">[Robert Penta]</a>: before our citizens of the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2150.559s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Since this is an election year and we're all running for office, those of you that are and those that might be candidates running for office, boasting about all the wonderful accomplishments and the hard votes that you had to take.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2163.325s">[Robert Penta]</a>: To me, this is a very important issue and I think it's an issue that needs to be presented and discussed and to have everybody, including the mayor, the city council and the school committee take a position on this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2173.609s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because isn't it weird, when we think about our America today and you see all the things that are taking place, whether it's before the National Football League or Little Pop Wanna Kids, the use of our American flag, the national anthem, seems to be at issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2191.897s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And our culture seems to be at issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2195.518s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But where are we going with all of that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2197.559s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2198.379s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, Sanctuary City's had its beginning here in the United States back in the 1980s.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2202.941s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Central folks, central people from Central America left their country looking for political refuge because of the oppressive nature that was taking place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2213.107s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what took place here in this country, and the churches, many of the churches throughout this country, they took these folks in, believing them to be in need of help, and for which we did, we helped them out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2225.964s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But that sort of like has morphed itself since 1981 to what it is today, addressing itself to sanctuary cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2235.111s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of sanctuary cities becoming what they are and having a different interpretation, you, Mr. President, just read something that was dated November 21, 2016.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2247.861s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you go to that third whereas, it says the city of Medford stands in support of all immigrant groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2253.666s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think the word before all<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2255.939s">[Robert Penta]</a>: an immigrant should be legal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2257.9s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All legal immigrant groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2260.16s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because we, the people of the United States, are a nation built on laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2265.642s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Its foundation is built on laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2268.123s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's on the legality of what we do each and every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2271.664s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it seems, and it seems that because of all this illegal immigration that is taking place in this country, you know, have we as a country now forgotten the fact or gotten to the point where everybody has a right<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2285.282s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're giving everybody rights, but nobody wants responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2289.623s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the responsibility that's being borne each and every day is the Mr. and Mrs. America, Mr. and Mrs. Medford Taxpayer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2297.265s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, I cannot think of any prouder comment than something that's written on the banner of the VFW of Mystic Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2308.728s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It says, all lives matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2312.441s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Everybody's lives matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2314.743s">[Robert Penta]</a>: White, black, blue, green.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2315.944s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't care what nationality you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2318.586s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you're here in this country and you're here legally or you have the proper legal documents earning your way to become an American citizen, your life matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2327.973s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And for those folks that come here illegally, that's in and of itself the question that's before us right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2335.459s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2336.713s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We as a community are very generous to so many people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2340.515s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You members on the council, especially your two new members, Councilor Scarpel and Councilor Falco, you've just gone through two years of community block grant funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2347.998s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you go through each and every one of those community block grant fundings, you will see the amount of money that's been dedicated and prioritized to charities within not only the city of Medford, but in the Tri-City and outside the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2362.224s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've also seen monies go to legal, council,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2366.36s">[Robert Penta]</a>: for people who have an illegal immigration condition needing to get itself resolved and coming forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2375.302s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We also have in this community all our churches and all the food pantries and the shelters taking care of as many people as they can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2384.383s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And while they're doing that, the question then becomes, who comes first, the illegal or the legal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2392.564s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think a sanctuary city, in and of itself,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2396.383s">[Robert Penta]</a>: presents that particular situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2398.684s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Like I said, again, depending on what side of the issue you're on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2403.127s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Sanctuary cities throughout this country, and there's 200 of them right now, that bar the use of government resources to enforce federal immigration laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2413.133s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they also allow illegals charged with crimes to be released without notifying federal authorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2420.918s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, in a report that was submitted in December of 2014 to Congress,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2425.754s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It stated that more than 30,000 convicted criminals have been released by ICE at the end of 2014, and they have gone back to the states, to the cities and towns that they came from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2438.123s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But inclusive of those crimes, there was 173 homicides, there were 373 sexual assaults, there were 186 kidnappings, and there was 1,000, excuse me, there was 14,014<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2456.055s">[Robert Penta]</a>: drunk driving charges to individuals that did not have a license.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2460.597s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There were more than 30,000 convicted criminal citations issued during that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2468.18s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What does that say to the law abiding citizen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2471.002s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But more importantly, what does that say to law enforcement personnel?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2477.79s">[Robert Penta]</a>: who especially now, if you're in a sanctuary city, you can't ask for identification as to are you an immigrant or not, you can't hold them, you can't call ISIS, excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2491.159s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It has a ramification that just really says to the police officer of today, beside doing my job for the city that I'm in, I am now having to become aware of somebody who might be here illegally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2506.499s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that person might get preferential treatment over someone who might be illegally, but that I can arrest and imprison.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2514.081s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's really not right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2516.701s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's a particular case that takes place from a gentleman and his two children that died.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2522.762s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He came from Lavon, Texas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2525.223s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he was hit by an illegal immigrant who hit him head on in a collision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2530.244s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he killed him, his four-year-old son, and his 22-month-old<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2535.14s">[Robert Penta]</a>: striped out his four-year-old daughter and his 22-year-old son.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2539.102s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The illegal person was arrested and plea bargained to a two-year sentence, a two-year sentence for wiping out a husband, a father, and a daughter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2553.508s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The woman subsequent to that has had some kind of public, how could you say, retaliation<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2562.588s">[Robert Penta]</a>: because she felt that the justice system didn't do her right, because she complained because of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2568.753s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the person that killed her husband, her daughter, and her son was Hispanic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2572.396s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She now becomes the culprit and not the victim.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2576.579s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are just little nuances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2578.34s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We can go to the entire country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2580.442s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There are cases where police officers have been killed, shot, brutally murdered by illegal immigrants here in this country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2588.408s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's not right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2589.469s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Absolutely not right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2592.469s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When we think about what's going on, illegals, they have the benefits of our free medical system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2599.152s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They go to our quality schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2601.433s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They get free housing and free food.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2603.694s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But they don't choose to blend in by learning English and assimilating to our American culture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2610.938s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And further, by committing crimes outside or inside the community or the state that they're in,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2618.539s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It adds a definite cost to our police, to our public safety, to our public education, and to Mr. and Mrs. Medford and Mr. and Mrs. America.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2629.225s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the question then becomes, on a sanctuary city, you folks are running for office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2634.708s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I haven't seen one of you yet say or put anywhere in your literature, just one gentleman so far, he's in the back of the room, made the point that he is for sanctuary cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2646.235s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I commend him for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2647.255s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He took his position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2649.369s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a very important issue to be discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2654.07s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because if you're telling me that you're abiding by this November 16th, strike that, November 23rd resolution, well this smacks of all the ingredients of a sanctuary city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2667.254s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Either we are or we're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2670.415s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think you Councilors and every candidate running for office needs to take that position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2675.757s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the reason why they need to take that position, whether you're for or against,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2680.441s">[Robert Penta]</a>: in a common, level-headed society, while we don't have to agree, we can respectfully disagree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2687.861s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's where I think we need to be going here in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2691.622s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, when you say we're a welcoming community, as a matter of fact, there's a billboard coming in on Route 93.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2697.483s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It says we are a welcoming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2698.984s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We've always been a welcoming committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2700.764s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We've got the third largest black population in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and we've had it for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2707.426s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And slowly but surely, they're leaving because nobody can afford to stay there anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2711.227s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The cost of housing in this community has gone completely out of control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2714.968s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Makes no sense at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2716.977s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if this present administration keeps wanting to put housing all over the place, and if this council doesn't want to review zoning, that's what's going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2724.681s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can have a city so out of control, you're not going to be able to understand what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2728.583s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And Dr. Stirella was right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2730.104s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Your finances will be so out of control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2732.765s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you add a sanctuary city to the mix, then please explain why you're doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2738.508s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And please let the people know as a candidate for office, that a sanctuary city, you're either for it or against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2757.509s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think the bottom line, my comment would basically, I don't think any city council, any mayor, any school committee person or anyone,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2766.741s">[Robert Penta]</a>: should tell a police department how to do their job, especially whether they're legal or illegal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2773.389s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's their job to protect and to serve, and not to be controlled by a political hierarchy in a community that turns around and says, we want to be a sanctuary city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5041.629s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5041.949s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Penteciro, Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5045.05s">[Robert Penta]</a>: First of all, for the young lady behind me, I'm not a white privileged individual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5052.355s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Had to work for everything in my life, starting at five o'clock in the morning for eight consecutive years, driving a canteen truck, being held up three times, shot at twice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5063.944s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I didn't give up because I knew what I wanted to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5067.326s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I wanted to get a college education and go forward with my life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5071.65s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's what I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5072.891s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I did not come here tonight to be decisive or have people become decisive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5079.556s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I came here tonight to present an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5081.707s">[Robert Penta]</a>: thanking Mr. Tudin, who made the acknowledgement that he is for a sanctuary city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5087.763s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a subject matter that needs to be discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5091.257s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The statistics that were given are actual statistics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5094.859s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can't get away, because they're not lying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5097.921s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And for the other lady who indicated that the crime rate for the individuals who are undocumented are less than regular American citizens that are documented and are legal, that in and of itself spells to the question of the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5114.511s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're doing more work because they have to deal with undocumented illegals over and beyond their regular course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5122.235s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, are all of them bad people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5124.736s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Absolutely not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5125.936s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do they deserve a fair shot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5128.278s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5130.359s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if they have to have some political intervention, which is taking place right now in Washington, so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5136.341s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the fact of the matter is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5138.601s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I stand here and I resent the fact that anyone, any seven of you or anyone in this audience, who wants to turn around and say, because I was born white, that I am privileged, that is false, that is wrong, and that is a lie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5151.525s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you should be ashamed of yourself for saying that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5154.346s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2073.491s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2077.695s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The part that I think is concerning is when we go back to the September 19 meeting and I don't know if Mr. Burns is in the other room or not but the question was asked when he came to the podium and he couldn't answer the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2091.3s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I know the solicitor is here so he may want to answer it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2095.201s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just don't know what somebody can do to make a presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2099.846s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If they can submit it by mail, which means they need a query check, if they don't need a query check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2104.871s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Right now, do all you Councilors need a query check because you're in a building where you're close to children that are outside in the school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2111.378s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The next question begs itself to City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2113.359s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Does every member of City Hall, every employee need a query check because if a parent comes in there or a taxpayer comes in there with a child and the child goes to the bathroom and the child is not with the parent and there's an employee there, does that subject the city or the employee to some kind of liability of a query check?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2128.83s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2129.951s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I think this whole issue has opened up a great question needs to be asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2134.634s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why do we need a query check and under what conditions and circumstances do we need it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2139.117s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If I understand this thing properly, if I'm a candidate for office like the seven of you are, a candidate for office, and if you come in here, supposedly you don't need a query check, but if you submit your<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2151.515s">[Robert Penta]</a>: take a desk by mail when you need a query check, or can you come in at any time, even though you're independent of your role as a Councilor being here tonight, walk around the building, and for that purpose, do you need a query check?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2162.848s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do employees in this building, custodians in this building, do they need a query check as it relates to their interaction with students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2169.335s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2170.696s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I understand that teachers, when they come on board, there's a query check sign on them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2174.819s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I understand all of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2175.939s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I don't know the nuances about everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2177.62s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Contractors, and I think we had here a couple of weeks ago, there was a gentleman come up, said he was putting lights in a certain part of the building, and in their second shift the question was asked, they said that they would be getting a query check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2188.787s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay, that's all well and good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2190.367s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I'd like to, I know the solicitor's here, but I'd like to have the council have a report that comes out that basically said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2196.951s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How is a query check going to be implemented?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2200.372s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And more importantly, if a taxpayer citizen wants to come up, work this room, submit a tape, does that taxpayer citizen have to be query checked or not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2209.115s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, because don't forget, this whole idea of public access was just what it's for, public access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2214.337s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if it was in any other location but this place here, I don't think we would be talking about a query check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2219.478s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I understand that this has its own entrance, its own locks, and it's separate from the main entrance of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2225.377s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I believe that in and of itself should probably give some credence that a query check is not needed, however this room is being used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2232.102s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I think we need some clarification to finalize this thing and we can move on with an election which is right around the corner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2238.427s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And let me just say this one last thing about the election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2240.769s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a damn shame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2242.148s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a damn shame, and I use the word damn shame, that this room and the access used for this was not in place prior to the primary election where all the candidates, incumbents, would have had an opportunity to come and make their presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2255.42s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This unfortunately seems to be at a last minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2257.582s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a quick ploy to get itself in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2259.484s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've got your notices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2261.345s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The last one is tomorrow or the next day this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2263.648s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's sort of like- It's sort of like- They've extended the schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2266.37s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They have extended the schedule but it's a little unfair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2268.772s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This has been running around for a long period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2271.095s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They had $650,000 of taxpayers' money from Verizon and Comcast that was used to put this building together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2278.462s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This has been taking place for a long period of time and I think it's just a little bit unfair and especially when the rules are inconsistent right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2286.529s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think that's what we need to know whether you're an incumbent or a newcomer running for this office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2291.374s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So, I would say before you take it and receive it and place it on file, I think those questions should be answered before you take that and receive it and place it on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2300.598s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2303.499s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Solicitor, the paper's already been disposed of, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2113.873s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2117.817s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Pantazero, Summit Road, Miffin Mass, former member of the Saugus party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2121.98s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The part that I think is concerning is when we go back to that September 19th meeting, and I don't know if Mr. Burns is in the other room or not, but the question that was asked of him when he came to the podium, he couldn't answer the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2131.647s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I know the solicitor is here, so he may want to answer it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2135.59s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just don't know what somebody can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2138.452s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to make a presentation if they can submit it by mail, which means they need a query check if they don't need a query check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2145.215s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Right now, do all you Councilors need a query check because you're in a building where you're close to children that are outside in the school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2151.797s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The next question begs itself to City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2153.758s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Does every member of City Hall, every employee need a query check because if a parent comes in there or a taxpayer comes in there with a child and the child goes to the bathroom and the child is not with the parent,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2164.402s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and there's an employee there, does that subject the city or the employee to some kind of liability of a query check?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2169.226s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2170.327s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I think this whole issue has opened up a great question needs to be asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2175.031s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why do we need a query check and under what conditions and circumstances do we need it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2179.534s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If I understand this thing properly, if I'm a candidate for office like the seven of you are, a candidate for office, and if you come in here, supposedly you don't need a query check, but if you submit your<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2191.867s">[Robert Penta]</a>: take a desk by mail when you need a query check, or can you come in at any time, even though you're independent of your role as a Councilor being here tonight, walk around the building, and for that purpose, do you need a query check?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2203.216s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do employees in this building, custodians in this building, do they need a query check as it relates to their interaction with students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2209.701s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2210.121s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, I understand that teachers, when they come on board, there's a query check sign on them, I understand all of that, but I don't know the nuances about everyone, contractors,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2219.128s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think we had here a couple of weeks ago, there was a gentleman come up, said he was putting lights in a certain part of the building, and in their second shift the question was asked, they said that they would be getting a query checked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2229.151s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay, that's all well and good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2230.731s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I'd like to, I know the solicitor's here, but I'd like to have the council have a report that comes out that basically said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2237.313s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How is a query check going to be implemented?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2240.755s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And more importantly, if a taxpayer citizen wants to come up, work this room, submit a tape, does that taxpayer citizen have to be query checked or not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2249.5s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, because don't forget, this whole idea of public access was just what it's for, public access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2254.703s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if it was in any other location but this place here, I don't think we would be talking about a query check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2259.846s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I understand that this has its own entrance, its own locks, and it's separate from the main entrance of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2265.742s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I believe that in and of itself should probably give some credence that a query check is not needed, however this room is being used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2272.47s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I think we need some clarification to finalize this thing and we can move on with an election which is right around the corner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2278.798s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And let me just say this one last thing about the election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2281.14s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a damn shame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2282.502s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a damn shame, and I use the word damn shame, that this room and the access used for this was not in place prior to the primary election where all the candidates, incumbents, would have had an opportunity to come and make their presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2295.789s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This unfortunately seems to be at a last minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2297.95s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a quick ploy to get itself in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2299.851s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've got your notices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2301.692s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The last one is tomorrow or the next day this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2304.014s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's sort of like- I think they've extended the schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2306.735s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They've extended the schedule, but it's a little bit unfair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2308.897s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, this has been running around for a long period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2311.46s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They had $650,000 of taxpayers' money from Verizon and Comcast that was used to put this building together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2318.827s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This has been taking place for a long period of time, and I think it's just a little bit unfair, and especially when the rules are inconsistent right now, I think that's what we need to know, whether you're an incumbent or a newcomer running for this office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2331.739s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So, I would say before you take it and receive it and place it on file, I think those questions should be answered before you take that and receive it and place it on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2341.003s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2343.884s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Solicitor, the paper's already been disposed of, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1666.095s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass, former member of the Saugus party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1671.557s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I present this to you, and I believe all of you got a copy of, that's a three page document that was mailed out early this summer, pursuant to the request of Council Wendell Curran to explain the rationale behind having a local option filing piece of legislation regarding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1691.317s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Community Preservation Act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1693.098s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When this Community Preservation Act was being sold to the folks here in the city of Medford, they were passing out pieces of literature such as this, talked about the Community Preservation Act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1702.48s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And on the back it says, communities submit annual reports to the state before receiving matching funds to ensure funds are properly spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1712.303s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Matching funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1714.184s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In 2002, which was the first year of the Community Preservation Act,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1717.838s">[Robert Penta]</a>: For the first six years, cities and towns got 100% of their monies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1722.723s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at that point in time, there was 113 communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1726.646s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, in 2015, when the city of Medford voted for it, there's 156 communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1732.552s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And all we're getting back this year is approximately 14.5%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1735.655s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's up to 178 communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1741.436s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The problem that's existing, speaking to these communities, and a lot of the folks, these legislators in these communities, are beginning to realize now that the tax, the CPA tax, the community preservation tax that people are paying for is not being matched by the Commonwealth of Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1758.159s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We voted for this in 2015.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1760.801s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Its first year of payment is now coming to us in 2017, this November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1766.246s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's approximately $180,000, and we, the committee, collected $1.2 million, $500,000 of taxpayers' money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1775.594s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The legislation that I'm proposing is not to abolish the CPA, but rather to make it fair and equitable<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1782.858s">[Robert Penta]</a>: for the folks who voted for it, and especially for the people of Medford who believed, when they voted for this, that the Commonwealth was going to match dollar for dollar through the trust fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1792.685s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And how it's being proposed right now is when you go to the Registry of Deeds, and whether it's a municipal lien or a tax on your real estate deeds, it's $10 or $20.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1800.651s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What they're thinking right now is doubling it, and that would constitute another tax on people who buy and sell property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1809.497s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But putting that aside, until that happens,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1812.06s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was 2013 when it was then Governor DeVal Patrick who took $20 million, I believe, $25 million from the surplus money of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts just to meet the bare bones minimum of monies to go back to cities and towns in 2013.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1829.507s">[Robert Penta]</a>: it was approximately 52% of the monies went back to the cities and towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1833.848s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're down now to 14%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1835.988s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the law says the state cannot go any lower than 5%, which is sort of like outrageous because you're gonna keep taxing taxpayers in this community for something that's not being met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1847.27s">[Robert Penta]</a>: People believed when they voted for the Community Preservation Act that the Commonwealth of Mass would match that dollar for dollar, it was advertised as such, and it was stated as such.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1857.485s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The two exceptions that I'm asking you folks to consider, and if you don't wanna vote on it tonight, that's all right, but I would appreciate it at least going to the city solicitor for the purposes of the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1867.927s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm asking that there be a hold on the city going further on collecting any monies from taxpayers under the CPA Community Preservation Act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1877.248s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because right now, it's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1878.949s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're telling the taxpayer that they have being taxed at 1.5% of their real estate value minus the first $100,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1887.685s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But at the same time, they're not gonna be getting that dollar amount from the trust fund, from the Commonwealth of Mass back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1892.37s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1893.771s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number two, the second part of the resolve is that this is a five-year commitment, as you know, and it automatically renews itself after five years, unless there's a legislative question on the ballot not to renew it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1906.679s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This second option is to have it go on the ballot automatically to renew it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1911.9s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So it dies, it's like sunset legislation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1914.281s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It just dies at the end of five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1916.621s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if the community still wants to have it and they wanna go forward with it, they put it back on the ballot once again and the people can vote for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1923.663s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think it's anything that's detrimental to this community other than the fact you're gonna keep taxing rate payers in this community for something they're not getting their money's worth for and they're not getting the match for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1934.146s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this greatly will impede<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1936.272s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This will greatly impede the concerns and the issues, whether it be for parks, historical pieces of property, low income housing, whatever the decision might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1946.001s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Plus the fact I believe that they're paying somebody approximately $65,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1948.143s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Pender, can I see that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1949.223s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1949.464s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1958.111s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe approximately right now somebody's getting paid, I believe if I understood when this came out a couple of months ago, somebody's gonna be paid approximately $65,000, $62,000, $149,000, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1966.26s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So we've collected $1,242,974 from the Medford taxpayers in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1968.062s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But all you're getting back from the Commonwealth of Mass is approximately $180,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1980.615s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1981.777s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not the way this was supposed to be going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1983.839s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now with more people coming on board, there's now 176 people applying for these monies from the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1992.384s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and having to go to the registry of deeds to double increase the taxes for municipal liens and for deed stamps that goes on our recordings, that's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2004.15s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just to meet the bare bones minimum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2007.151s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This year it's only 14%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2008.472s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was reported in the local press earlier this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2011.253s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You call the state house, they'll tell you the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2013.734s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you call, for which I had a long extensive conversation with the people in Boston, it's called the CPA,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2022.057s">[Robert Penta]</a>: in Boston, their research people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2026.223s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is not, this is not to say I or anyone opposed to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2031.75s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What I'm opposed to is the inequity that this is now presented here within our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2036.736s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this inequity is not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2038.939s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because people are believing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2041.105s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you're only given $180,000 back on the $1.24 million, well, all we're asking to do is to put this on hold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2048.928s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Medford taxpayers do not have to pay for this until such time that the Commonwealth meets its obligation for the purposes of giving the reimbursement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2057.192s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what sold this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2059.032s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what people voted for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2060.473s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's what they believed that they were getting, a match from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2064.075s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And unfortunately, it's not existing, and it's not there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2067.92s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That should have been told, that should have been explained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2069.661s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think, Mr. Clerk, you can attest to the fact over 1,200 people never turned their ballot over in 2015 to vote yes or no on the question itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2078.104s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So whether the people were not informed properly when they went to vote, or they just didn't want to vote, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2083.686s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But that's an awful lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2084.666s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I just think it takes into the serious consideration of today, hard times, people, water connectivity fee, water and sewer taxes, your tax rate keeps going up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2096.006s">[Robert Penta]</a>: new police station, new fire station, a library.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2099.948s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where is this money coming from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2101.489s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's the most unfair way to go out and tax somebody right now on this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2106.071s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is a state issue for which people went on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2109.331s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe that this would be one way to at least mitigate until the Commonwealth of Mass gets its act together, either they're going to give the 100% back or they're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2118.442s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why should you deal with the idea that we'll, we guarantee 5% because that's what the law says?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2122.887s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, what's 5%?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2123.828s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's meaningless.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2125.69s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That is stupid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2127.512s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm more than happy to answer any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2159.19s">[Robert Penta]</a>: With all due respect, Rick, I have a folder here, and if you want to, I'll go over it with you, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2165.312s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This first came across the city council in 1991, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2170.154s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in 1991, when this came out, when it became part of its first proposal, I think the then-Method City Council<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2176.276s">[Robert Penta]</a>: did not want to entertain it at the time because they felt it was another tax on the people, unfairly hitting them without having a say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2183.903s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you only can put it in those four particular areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2186.345s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Right now, okay, the people voted for it, we accept that, I got no problem with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2190.289s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But how do you continue to go forward and tax the people when you're not even getting the money back?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2194.593s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're not even getting 50% of it back, you're only getting 14.5% of the money back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2197.075s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's totally unfair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2201.599s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you go to these other cities and towns and you talk to them like I have, a lot of them are not realizing it until you go in there and you start reading the information that they have there and how it's broken down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2211.204s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I got volumes on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2213.125s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't sit home and read this for my health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2215.005s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm concerned about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2216.246s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it's an end run on Proposition 2.5 if you continue to tax the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2221.142s">[Robert Penta]</a>: at the way you're going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2222.583s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is an alternative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2224.364s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a legitimate alternative that a city and town can pose, and until such time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2229.507s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this is only good for five years, remember that, because the first year that you voted for was 15 to 16, and you had to get those numbers together, so you're not getting that money until 17.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2238.812s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the city of Medford is only gonna get it for four of the five years on the CPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2243.034s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then if it goes automatically after that, it'll be every year on and after that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2246.796s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But what I'm saying is at the end of the fifth year, Rick,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2250.413s">[Robert Penta]</a>: the option would be that it ends, it becomes part of sunset legislation, and if the community wants to do it again, they put it on the ballot like they did the first time, and the people can vote it up or they can vote it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2410.106s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what I'm asking here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2411.367s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Motion to sever the papers, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2437.129s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Chase, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2446.291s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You could go through the state delegation, but you also could go through your local legislative body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2450.64s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's why I said a local home will petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2452.663s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd like to make one correction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2453.665s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I said 1991.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2454.287s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was 2001 when this first came up in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2458.461s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And from 2001, 2002, which was the first year, to 2007, the first six years, 100% went back to cities and towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2467.528s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But they started off at 34, and then they went to 113 cities and towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2472.071s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The next year, from 2008 going forward, you went from 127, now up to 176, and it's been downhill ever since.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2479.917s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And again, we're just looking at equity, something that's fair to the Medford taxpayer,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2486.636s">[Robert Penta]</a>: especially the one that doesn't realize they're not getting it, that the state is not matching the money, as they said, and that's the term that they used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2493.659s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Their own booklet, when they sent it out, way back when, it broke down all the cities and towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2498.641s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And like I said, I would just be asking respectfully that the council either forward this to the city solicitor and ask him if this could be done, and if not, then we go to the second row, asking our state legislation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2538.91s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Things that you want us to present to the city solicitor asking Right in the letter it designates both sections of the law section to amend section 16 a and section 16 B of the sections 4 to 7 sections 3 to 7 of chapter 44 which this city accepted when they voted for the for the act in 2015<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2563.064s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The legality of the law or if he would prepare legally a home rule petition that could be forwarded to our state legislators for the purposes of, again, this is not repealing it or getting rid of it, just to amend what's there until such time that the Commonwealth<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2582.745s">[Robert Penta]</a>: figures out how to give us the 100% back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2588.369s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's part of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2592.873s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, no, that's part of the proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2595.054s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Not now, not doing it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2597.777s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Filing the piece of legislation that would allow cities and towns through their local legislative body to hold back collecting until 100% and then the second part would be if this were to be accepted and voted upon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2798.991s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you read the last sentence of my paragraph, the intent of this home rule, local option petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2804.432s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a local option petition filed if the city of Medford feels that they would like to go forward as a local option petition for which the people would have a chance to vote on it, so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2815.816s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If they don't have that option,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2817.497s">[Robert Penta]</a>: than the local option, then we would take it to the legislature and have them file it for whatever the purposes might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2823.124s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm presenting it because I really think it's sort of like unfair to tax these people, to tax our citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2828.772s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I said in 2013, $25 million was taken out of the surplus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2835.39s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In 2014, $11.4 million was taken out of the state surplus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2840.093s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in 2015, $10 million was taken out of the state surplus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2843.034s">[Robert Penta]</a>: From 2016 forward, there's been no surplus and no money to be taken out, and all that's happening is people are being taxed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2850.078s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Unfairly being taxed for something that they're not getting their money back on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2853.94s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's like you going to the store and buying a new suit, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2858.762s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they said it's $199, you go there, it's $300 because they didn't tell you about all the other incidentals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2864.125s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2865.126s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All we're asking for is equity, fairness to this whole thing, and having an opportunity just to present it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2870.768s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Again, this is not to kill it, to squash it or anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2873.41s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's just to bring equity until such time that the Commonwealth can prove, can prove.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2877.612s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor Marks, you just said it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2879.653s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You spoke to someone up there and they said they created something, they can't control it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2884.395s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a monster that's out of control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2886.196s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But unfortunately, the rate payers, the taxpayers are paying for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2889.818s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2890.638s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't believe that that is fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3008.034s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So, is Councilor Knight saying it's okay to tax the people without getting the adjustment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3012.298s">[Robert Penta]</a>: redemption for why they voted for this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3033.46s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is Councilor Knight alleging that I'm spewing false information, and that my statistics are wrong, that we're only getting 14%, okay, 14.55%?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3042.73s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, I think you go back and listen to what he said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3045.319s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why don't you go back and listen to it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3051.343s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just can't believe that a board would want to continuously tax people in this room, in this community, knowing that it's wrong because the Commonwealth is not at least meeting its obligation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3063.791s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They can't even get to 50%, never mind 15%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3067.833s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's just wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3075.997s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Rick, it's right there on the back of the card.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3078.978s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It says matching funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3645.861s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The letter that you wrote from the gentleman from the CPA incorrectly states that this was a petition to apply to all cities and towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3651.844s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3653.269s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that basically... That's what he wrote back to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3657.151s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Apparently you didn't translate it properly, or you didn't understand it properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3660.072s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I kind of transparent what you said to me to make sure that I... But apparently it was wrong because I don't want anyone to be misled to think that I'm asking this for all cities and towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3668.757s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was just for the city of Medford, a local community home rule petition option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3878.347s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So there's no appetite here to send this to the city solicitor for the purposes of reviewing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3883.071s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So what we're saying is just keep taxing the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3890.278s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well would you do it Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1806.782s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass, former member of the Saugus Party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1812.243s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I present this to you, and I believe all of you got a copy of, that's a three-page document that was mailed out early this summer, pursuant to the request of Councilwoman McCurran to explain the rationale behind having a local option filing piece of legislation regarding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1832.004s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Community Preservation Act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1833.785s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When this Community Preservation Act was being sold to the folks here in the city of Medford, they were passing out pieces of literature such as this, talked about the Community Preservation Act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1843.187s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And on the back it says, communities submit annual reports to the state before receiving matching funds to ensure funds are properly spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1852.99s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Matching funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1854.871s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In 2002, which was the first year of the Community Preservation Act,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1858.525s">[Robert Penta]</a>: For the first six years, cities and towns got 100% of their monies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1863.41s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at that point in time, there was 113 communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1867.333s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, in 2015, when the city of Medford voted for it, there's 156 communities, and all we're getting back this year is approximately 14.5%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1876.342s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's up to 178 communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1882.14s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The problem that's existing, speaking to these communities, and a lot of the folks, these legislators in these communities, are beginning to realize now that the tax, the CPA tax, the community preservation tax that people are paying for is not being matched by the Commonwealth of Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1898.846s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We voted for this in 2015.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1901.509s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Its first year of payment is now coming to us in 2017, this November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1906.954s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's approximately $180,000, and we, the committee, collected $1.2 million, $500,000 of taxpayers' money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1916.283s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The legislation that I'm proposing is not to abolish the CPA, but rather to make it fair and equitable<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1923.545s">[Robert Penta]</a>: for the folks who voted for it, and especially for the people of Medford who believed, when they voted for this, that the Commonwealth was going to match dollar for dollar through the trust fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1933.347s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And how it's being proposed right now is when you go to the Registry of Deeds, and whether it's a municipal lien or a tax on your real estate deeds, it's $10 or $20.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1941.289s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What they're thinking right now is doubling it, and that would constitute another tax on people who buy and sell property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1950.151s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But putting that aside, until that happens,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1952.71s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was 2013 when it was then Governor DeVal Patrick who took $20 million, I believe, $25 million from the surplus money of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts just to meet the bare bones minimum of monies to go back to cities and towns in 2013.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1970.16s">[Robert Penta]</a>: it was approximately 52% of the monies went back to the cities and towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1974.522s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're down now to 14%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1976.643s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the law says the state cannot go any lower than 5%, which is sort of like outrageous because you're gonna keep taxing taxpayers in this community for something that's not being met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1987.948s">[Robert Penta]</a>: People believed when they voted for the Community Preservation Act that the Commonwealth of Mass would match that dollar for dollar, it was advertised as such, and it was stated as such.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1998.122s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The two exceptions that I'm asking you folks to consider, and if you don't wanna vote on it tonight, that's all right, but I would appreciate it at least going to the city solicitor for the purposes of the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2008.59s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm asking that there be a hold on the city going further on collecting any monies from taxpayers under the CPA Community Preservation Act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2017.916s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because right now, it's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2019.617s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're telling the taxpayer that they have being taxed at 1.5% of their real estate value minus the first $100,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2028.322s">[Robert Penta]</a>: but at the same time they're not going to be getting that dollar amount from the trust fund, from the Commonwealth of Mass Bath.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2033.004s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2034.405s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number two, the second part of the resolve is that this is a five-year commitment as you know, and it automatically renews itself after five years, unless there's a legislative question on the ballot not to renew it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2047.363s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This second option is to have it go on the ballot automatically to renew it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2052.607s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So it dies, it's like sunset legislation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2054.989s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It just dies at the end of five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2057.33s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if the community still wants to have it and they wanna go forward with it, they put it back on the ballot once again and the people can vote for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2064.375s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think it's anything that's detrimental to this community other than the fact you're gonna keep taxing rate payers in this community for something they're not getting their money's worth for and they're not getting the match for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2074.843s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this greatly will impede<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2076.942s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This will greatly impede the concerns and the issues, whether it be for parks, historical pieces of property, low income housing, whatever the decision might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2086.672s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Plus the fact, I believe, that they're paying somebody approximately $65,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2088.814s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Pender, can I see that card?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2090.136s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2098.801s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe approximately right now somebody's getting paid, I believe if I understood when this came out a couple of months ago, somebody's gonna be paid approximately $65,000, $62,000, $149,000, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2106.926s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So we've collected $1,242,974.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2114.811s">[Robert Penta]</a>: from the Medford taxpayers in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2117.195s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But all you're getting back from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is approximately $180,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2119.918s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2122.462s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not the way this was supposed to be going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2124.525s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now with more people coming on board, there's now 176 people applying for these monies from the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2133.054s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and having to go to the Registry of Deeds to double increase the taxes for municipal liens and for deed stamps that goes on our recordings, that's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2144.824s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just to meet the bare bones minimum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2147.826s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This year it's only 14%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2149.147s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was reported in the local press earlier this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2151.93s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You call the state house, they'll tell you the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2154.412s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you call, for which I had a long extensive conversation with the people in Boston, is call the CPA,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2162.727s">[Robert Penta]</a>: in Boston, their research people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2166.89s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is not, this is not to say I or anyone opposed to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2172.415s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What I'm opposed to is the inequity that this is now presented here within our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2177.399s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this inequity is not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2179.601s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because people are believing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2181.795s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you're only given $180,000 back on the $1.24 million, well, all we're asking to do is to put this on hold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2189.617s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Metro taxpayers do not have to pay for this until such time that the Commonwealth meets its obligation for the purposes of giving the reimbursement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2197.859s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what sold this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2199.719s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what people voted for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2201.179s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's what they believed that they were getting, a match from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2204.78s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And unfortunately, it's not existing, and it's not there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2208.587s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That should have been told, that should have been explained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2210.347s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think, Mr. Clerk, you can attest to the fact over 1,200 people never turned their ballot over in 2015 to vote yes or no on the question itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2218.73s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So whether the people were not informed properly when they went to vote, or they just didn't want to vote, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2224.331s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But that's an awful lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2225.611s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I just think it takes into the serious consideration of today, hard times, people, water connectivity fee, water and sewer taxes, your tax rate keeps going up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2236.727s">[Robert Penta]</a>: new police station, new fire station, a library.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2240.651s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where is this money coming from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2242.032s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's the most unfair way to go out and tax somebody right now on this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2246.776s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is a state issue for which people went on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2250.018s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe that this would be one way to at least mitigate until the Commonwealth of Mass gets its act together, either they're going to give the 100 percent back or they're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2259.067s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why should you deal with the idea that we'll—we guarantee 5 percent because that's what the law says?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2263.531s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, what's 5 percent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2264.652s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's meaningless.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2266.334s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That is stupid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2268.155s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm more than happy to answer any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2299.894s">[Robert Penta]</a>: With all due respect, Rick, I have a folder here, and if you want to, I'll go over it with you, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2306.003s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This first came across the city council in 1991, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2310.85s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in 1991, when this came out, when it became part of its first proposal, I think the then-Method City Council<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2316.938s">[Robert Penta]</a>: did not want to entertain it at the time because they felt it was another tax on the people, unfairly hitting them without having a say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2324.565s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you only can put it in those four particular areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2327.027s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Right now, okay, the people voted for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2328.808s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We accept that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2329.469s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I got no problem with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2331.01s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But how do you continue to go forward and tax the people when you're not even getting the money back?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2335.294s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're not even getting 50% of it back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2336.275s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're only getting 14.5% of the money back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2337.776s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's totally unfair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2342.32s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you go to these other cities and towns and you talk to them like I have, a lot of them are not realizing it until you go in there and you start reading the information that they have there and how it's broken down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2351.912s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I got volumes on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2353.854s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't sit home and read this for my health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2355.716s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm concerned about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2356.958s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it's an end run on Proposition 2.5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2359.041s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you continue to tax the people,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2361.845s">[Robert Penta]</a>: at the way you're going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2363.305s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is an alternative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2365.066s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a legitimate alternative that a city and town can pose, and until such time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2370.206s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this is only good for five years, remember that, because the first year that you voted for was 15 to 16, and you had to get those numbers together, so you're not getting that money until 17.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2379.528s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the city method's only gonna get it for four of the five years on the CPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2383.729s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then if it goes automatically after that, it'll be every year on and after that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2387.509s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But what I'm saying is at the end of the fifth year, Rick,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2391.137s">[Robert Penta]</a>: the option would be that it ends, it becomes part of sunset legislation, and if the community wants to do it again, they put it on the ballot, like they did the first time, and the people can vote it up, or they can vote it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2550.817s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what I'm asking here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2552.077s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Motion to sever the papers, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2554.217s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, what are the motions before us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2577.83s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Chase, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2586.992s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You could go through the state delegation, but you also could go through your local legislative body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2591.354s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's why I said a local home will petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2593.355s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd like to make one correction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2594.356s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I said 1991.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2594.956s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was 2001 when this first came up in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2599.148s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And from 2001, 2002, which was the first year, to 2007, the first five years, first six years, 100% went back to cities and towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2608.215s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But they started off at 34, and then they went to 113 cities and towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2612.738s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The next year, from 2008 going forward, you went from 127, now up to 176, and it's been downhill ever since.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2620.563s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And again, we're just looking at equity, something that's fair to the Medford taxpayer,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2627.309s">[Robert Penta]</a>: especially the one that doesn't realize they're not getting it, that the state is not matching the money, as they said, and that's the term that they used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2634.312s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They were in Brooklyn when they sent it out, way back when.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2636.993s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It broke down all the cities and towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2639.294s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And like I said, I would just be asking respectfully that the council either forward this to the city solicitor and ask him if this could be done, and if not, then we go to the second row asking our state legislature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2683.353s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Right in the letter it designates both sections of the law section to amend section 16a and section 16b of the sections 4 to 7 sections 3 to 7 of chapter 44 which this city accepted when they voted for the for the act in 2015.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2703.718s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The legality of the law or if he would prepare legally a home rule petition that could be forwarded to our state legislators for the purposes of, again, this is not repealing it or getting rid of it, just to amend what's there until such time that the Commonwealth<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2723.489s">[Robert Penta]</a>: figures out how to give us the 100% back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2729.071s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's part of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2733.573s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, no, that's part of the proposal, not now, not doing it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2738.474s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Filing the piece of legislation that would allow cities and towns through their local legislative body to hold back collecting until 100% and then the second part would be if this were to be accepted and voted upon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2939.699s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you read the last sentence of my paragraph, the intent of this home rule, local option petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2945.144s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a local option petition filed if the city of Medford feels that they would like to go forward as a local option petition for which the people would have a chance to vote on it, so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2956.535s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If they don't have that option,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2958.197s">[Robert Penta]</a>: than the local option, then we would take it to the legislature and have them file it for whatever the purposes might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2963.823s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm presenting it because I really think it's sort of like unfair to tax these people, to tax our citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2971.131s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I said in 2013, $25 million was taken out of the surplus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2973.513s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In 2014, $11.4 million was taken out of the state surplus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2980.18s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in 2015, $10 million was taken out of the state surplus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2983.764s">[Robert Penta]</a>: From 2016 forward, there's been no surplus and no money to be taken out, and all that's happening is people are being taxed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2990.79s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Unfairly being taxed for something that they're not getting their money back on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2994.674s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's like you going to the store and buying a new suit, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2999.458s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they said it's $199, you go there, it's $300 because they didn't tell you about all the other incidentals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3004.863s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3005.863s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All we're asking for is equity, fairness to this whole thing, and having an opportunity just to present it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3011.505s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Again, this is not to kill it, to squash it, or anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3014.146s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's just to bring equity until such time that the Commonwealth can prove, can prove.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3018.348s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor Marks, you just said it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3020.409s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You spoke to someone up there, and they said they created something, they can't control it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3025.13s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a monster that's out of control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3026.931s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But unfortunately, the ratepayers, the taxpayers, are paying for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3030.572s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3031.372s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't believe that that is fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3148.701s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So is Councilor Knight saying it's okay to tax the people without getting the adjust?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3153.002s">[Robert Penta]</a>: redemption for why they voted for this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3174.175s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is Councilor Knight alleging that I'm spewing false information and that my statistics are wrong, that we're only getting 14%?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3179.48s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay, 14.555%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3183.403s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, I think you go back and listen to what he said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3185.746s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why don't you go back and listen to it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3192.17s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just can't believe that a board would want to continuously tax people in this room, in this community, knowing that it's wrong because the Commonwealth is not at least meeting its obligation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3204.478s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They can't even get to 50%, never mind 15%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3208.52s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's just wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3216.683s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Rick, it's right there on the back of the card.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3219.644s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It says matching funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3275.965s">[Robert Penta]</a>: 2015, we voted, it was 29%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3276.866s">[Robert Penta]</a>: 29%, oh gosh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3278.487s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then I think it went down to 18, now it's 14, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3281.188s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah, it went down to 20, and now we're down to 14.5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3786.585s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The letter that you wrote from the gentleman from the CPA incorrectly states that this was a petition to apply to all cities and towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3792.568s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3793.993s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that basically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3797.876s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Apparently you didn't translate it properly, or you didn't understand it properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3803.679s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But apparently it was wrong because I don't want anyone to be misled to think that I'm asking this for all cities and towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3809.503s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was just for the city of Medford, a local community home rule petition option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=4019.059s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So there's no appetite here to send this to the city solicitor for the purposes of reviewing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=4024.741s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So what we're saying is just keep taxing the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8841.125s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert M. Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of this August body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8846.808s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The reason why I'm up here is twofold, as the resolution indicates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8851.348s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I was a little befuddled when I got a copy of my water bill, and then I got a copy of the letter signed by the Board of Water and Soil Commissioners as it relates to what they call a baseline fee, which is, in essence, is a new tax on the rate payers here within this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8866.493s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In their letter where they make an assessment of $24,000 is $24,483 is necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8869.314s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know if this is a misprint on the spelling here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8880.103s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Pardon me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8881.705s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's 24 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8882.646s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, that's the amount, I believe, of the total amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8885.468s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe, if I understood it correctly from the chairman of the board, he alleged that it was approximately a $300,000 deficit on the sewer account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8893.516s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, this August, Marty, some weeks ago, voted to incorporate your enterprise fund, which includes the water and sewer account, as one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8902.325s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And by having the water and sewer count as one, that allows you, by right and by law, to make adjustments as it relates to profits and losses on either side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8912.335s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at the present time, the new water bills that are going to be going out are going to be having an alleged 3% reduction in your water rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8921.764s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you're going to be charged what they call now a new connectivity fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8926.325s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this connectivity fee is addressing the fact that if you have whatever your line is that you have in your house, as it relates to your water and sewer hookup, from your house to the street, for which every taxpayer who owns the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8961.89s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The fact of the matter is that the Water and Sewer Commission signed it, and the mayor of this community has allowed it, and likewise, this Medford City Council has done nothing to rebut it, for which you have a unique opportunity right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8973.763s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The fact also presents itself with the issue that with this new combined water and sewer allowance,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8981.519s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why would you be reducing your water rate by 3% and now coming in and want to put a brand new tax on each and every other month, bimonthly, six times a year, ad infinitum, on Medford taxpayers, knowing that you have a surplus in excess of $8 million and you have a deficit in the sewer account<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9003.965s">[Robert Penta]</a>: for this 2018 year of $300,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9006.266s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That does not make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9010.307s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the reason why it makes no sense is you will continuously keep going with a profit that you have, and your water and sewer count, and you have nothing presented before you as of the meeting that we had a month ago and as of tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9021.69s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Any major road construction, any major sidewalk construction, any street construction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9040.883s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The fact of the matter is, Mr. President, the connectivity tax that's going to be charged to the ratepayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9072.846s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The Water and Sewer Commission comes under the auspices of the Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9075.167s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They are appointed by the Mayor, and their recommendations go to the Mayor, and their recommendations, I'm quite sure, could not be holding to the taxpayers of this community at an outrageous rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9084.509s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So a new tax and fee is being implemented on the taxpayers of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9159.838s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm glad you apologized on behalf of the council, because most recently, everybody got in their water and sewer bills<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9174.068s">[Robert Penta]</a>: a letter that indicated that they were going to be getting a new processing baseline rate, which I will call a tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9182.058s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a new tax implemented on the citizens of this community on their water and sewer bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9187.445s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's called a connectivity fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9190.017s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you're going to be paying for that each and every other month, six times a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9195.439s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Every taxpayer that owns their home owns from their house to the middle of the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9200.381s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's their pipe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9201.822s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what they're responsible for, and that's what they pay for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9205.043s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They make that connection already into the city's water and sewer line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9208.925s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The city is already charging you for water and sewer coming into your house through your pipe, through the connection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9215.548s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, the argument that's being used by the Water and Sewer Commission is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9219.329s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We need to put this money aside, which is approximately $1 million a year, according to the type and size of your pipe coming into your house, connected to the street, to offset any future costs that might put the city in a negative position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9236.053s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My argument before this honorable body, I hope most of you can accept that word,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9242.984s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Honorable, is the fact that the water and sewer account that we have right now is an $8.5 million surplus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9252.155s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've merged, within the past two months, the water and sewer accounts of the Enterprise as to be one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9258.823s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you are alleging, as the Water and Sewer Commission is alleging, there was a $300,000 deficit in the sewer account, but at the same time you're proposing a 3% reduction in the water rate for next year, the irony to that does not make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9275.631s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9276.352s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because you have an $8 million surplus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9278.633s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have them both now merged together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9280.674s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the law allows you to take a surplus from one to offset the negative of another or vice versa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9287.077s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The other thing that this Water and Soil Commission has failed to do, it's under a 360 CMR 1100.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9294.762s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a continuation of contract water supplies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9298.465s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this came out in 1994.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9299.285s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it states the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9301.947s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You incorporate a uniform rate or an alternative structure which provides incentives for water conservation and or is designed to ensure the affordability of water service to low and or fixed income people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9317.117s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't have that at the present time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9319.76s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's never been brought up before the Water and Soil Commission to give that particular rate out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9324.704s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9326.485s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if you're even going to get into the idea of the thought process of wanting to get into this, how do you justify the rates that are being proposed by the city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9335.914s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The rates being proposed by the city range anywhere from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9341.055s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A residential house up to 3 quarters of an inch would be $51.66 a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9347.142s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, you may say it's only $51.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9349.125s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you know something?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9351.387s">[Robert Penta]</a>: $51 to some people is a lot of money, especially if you want a fixed income.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9355.272s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you have a one-inch line coming into your house, it's $141 a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9360.658s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Take that and add it on to the CPA tax, for which you're not even going to get reimbursed by the state on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9366.241s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That is another $50, $60 a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9368.281s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now you're almost up to over $150, $200 a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9372.023s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Your taxes each and every year continuously keep going up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9375.064s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's absolutely unfair for the city to even entertain or engage itself in a connectivity fee tax every other month when you're sitting on that kind of a profit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9385.749s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, if you want to be realistic and look at this thing and say, OK, maybe we should do like some other cities and towns, the community of Melrose, your sister next door, they have a one-time fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9397.352s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's at the discretion of the director of public works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9400.553s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a one-time fee of $50.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9403.073s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you're building a new house and it's a first-time connection, so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9406.734s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you're rebuilding your house and you have to make a reconnection, that reconnection is either $50 and or at the discretion<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9414.753s">[Robert Penta]</a>: of the Director of Public Works, because if you're the same owner, it could be abated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9418.623s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It just doesn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9423.246s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't make any sense because you, as the Medford City Council, are supposed to be looking out for the best financial interests of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9432.07s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the only way you can seem to do it right now, at least through the majority of you, if you so choose, is you just hold this budget in abeyance until the mayor comes forward and indicates how can you keep going out and making these charges against Medford taxpayers and ratepayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9450.757s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let's flip over to the second part, to the hotel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9454.34s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a hotel proposal that you haven't even sat down, hasn't even been discussed, and there the mayor of this community in the State of the City address in February says this is going to be up and running by the fall of 2019.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9469.977s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You haven't had a discussion either with the contractor who's only been around since 2013.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9476.16s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't even know what the taxes is going to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9479.221s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the best part about this hotel, you need city and state land to be taken to accommodate the parking that's necessary for this proposed hotel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9487.624s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Here's your time to discuss it during the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9490.886s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you don't discuss it, why give the vote out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9494.487s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9496.741s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's unfortunate under this form of government that this mayor who said she was going to be transparent and would have someone here each and every week to listen and to discuss these issues, there's nobody here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9507.723s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're lucky if that person's been here twice in the two years that it's been here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9512.144s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what doesn't make sense is how can you go back and keep telling Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer that this is only a small little dollar amount, especially when you're dealing with a surplus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9523.086s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've got $9 million in your free cash or thereabouts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9526.892s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But nobody around here has discussed your $29 million in an unfunded liability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9533.258s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How are you going to address that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9534.9s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And is this new connectivity charge going to be able to be used to offset salaries and wages of employees in that department, pension system funds?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9544.97s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are the questions you need to ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9547.232s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the low and moderate income, fixed income people don't even have a break on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9552.242s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So while you think you're making the taxpayer feel good because you're lowering his water rate by 3%, you're charging him in excess of the 3% by having a bimonthly, six times a year, new tax being placed upon him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9569.271s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the line that should really get you in every single ratepayer is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9573.513s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It says the base rate is not a tax, nor is it an additional charge in which residents pay for water and sewer services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9581.059s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, you tell me what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9583.101s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You tell me, Mr. President, what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9585.223s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If it's not a tax, okay, if it's not a fee, and if it's not for water and sewer services, well, why am I paying a connectivity fee to let that water go through that pipe that comes into the pipe that I own, that comes into my house, that you charge me water and sewer taxes on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9601.263s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I respectfully ask this Medford City Council to ask this mayor, you hold up this question and remove this connectivity fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9609.29s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's an unfair tax, it's unnecessary, and it does not do good for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9616.156s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm more than happy to answer any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9618.238s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9645.443s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How you would rebut it is you would tell the mayor that we're not voting for your budget until you tell the Water and Sewer commissioners to roll back that fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9654.29s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You justify $8.5 million sitting there and justify telling the taxpayers you're going to generate another million dollars plus a year with this connectivity fee, and you don't even have a program set aside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9667.262s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Look at every street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9668.383s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Look at all the streets that are waiting to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9670.585s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Look at the potholes that can't get done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9672.527s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Look at Evans Street that's been promised for almost two years they were going to get done when the water main broke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9678.032s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We could just go on and on and on with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9680.434s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can't keep charging the taxpayers of this community for something, especially when you're sitting on millions of dollars in a surplus in this particular account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9714.735s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're reducing the water rate, Madam Chairperson, we're reducing the water rate by 3%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9720.52s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if you have a $24 million cost, whatever it is, I think that's what you said, Mr. President, for the cost of coming in this year, and inclusive of that cost is water and sewer charges, because it's coming in, and we all know that your sewer charge is at 121% of your water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9734.975s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if the city already knows that they're going to be operating at a $300,000 loss, why wouldn't you just take the money from your $8.5 million profit rather than go out and tell the people we're going to charge you for a connectivity fee and have the audacity to put in a letter that's got nothing to do with water and sewer services?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9753.321s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What do you think, people are stupid?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9755.785s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm not stupid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9757.245s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, I love this city, and I'll do anything to make it right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9760.627s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But when I see stuff like this, this really gets to me, all right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9764.248s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it should get to every one of you members of the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9767.209s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because it's not right, it's not fair, and you can't even take care of people on fixed incomes, you know, allowing you to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9774.631s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You haven't even discussed that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9775.891s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where's the Water and Soil Commissioner on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9781.035s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Didn't mean TL, Mr. President, but you know something?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9783.516s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When you sit here all night and you watch what's going on here and you're being played to wait till the end of the night, I get upset.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9790.337s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9791.298s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But every dog has its day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9792.478s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Remember that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9793.658s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's an election coming up and I hope people remember that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9796.579s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1109.584s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, I think in part we all know that around 5 o'clock or 5.30 this evening, I think we received the mayor's press release.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1120.506s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that he'd signed the contract with Republic from Tennessee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1123.708s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I'll get to that later on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1125.17s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's still part of the comparison.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1127.672s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, when we came on board at the beginning of the year, we were asked to give what our priorities were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1131.515s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I believe the police department and police station was our number one priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1136.018s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And unfortunately, it hasn't found itself anywhere in any of the mayor's agendas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1141.803s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, the police station would derive an extreme benefit for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1147.027s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It would make us go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1149.571s">[Robert Penta]</a>: not only socially, but as a community going forward with tomorrow's technology, and it would also give a presence of community policing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1160.516s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's something I think a lot of the people asking for, more police officers, more patrolmen, more visibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1167.699s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you give them a better place to work out of, then I think that would go a long way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1174.341s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, we paid in excess, I think, of $78,000<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1178.979s">[Robert Penta]</a>: when we received the feasibility study from the police department and the fire department on May 5th of this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1185.881s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And unfortunately for the police department, they didn't get anything out of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1189.182s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Fire department did, but the police department didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1192.864s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And once again, I don't know, maybe it's just the mayor, he doesn't have it on his radar screen, but public safety, I believe is the first of priorities here of any of all the councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1204.168s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Some of the things that Mr. Mayor, that would be beneficial, not only for our community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1209.378s">[Robert Penta]</a>: is the council has supported, in each and every calendar budget, the recycling of two new cruises each and every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1218.363s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that would go a long way, once again, to add to the police officers on duty, driving their cruises, letting them know that the city is thinking about them, and they don't have to drive in a car that has about 140,000 miles on it, and they don't know if it's gonna make it or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1233.892s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it was Councilor Marks, three years ago,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1238.24s">[Robert Penta]</a>: came up with the idea of why can't we have a special truck enforcement unit?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1241.321s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1243.522s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What's wrong with training one or two people to be involved with truck enforcement for that particular purpose?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1249.584s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because I think we can go down any one of these streets in any one of these days, and we see the amount of trucks that travel down High Street, Main Street, or the major streets here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1258.407s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That would go a long way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1260.588s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In our public safety issue regarding lighting, all the squares are just dimly lit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1266.069s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that in and of itself is an invitation<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1268.356s">[Robert Penta]</a>: for some type of crime, whatever the crime might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1271.358s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You get Route 16, the parking lot behind St.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1274.16s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Joe's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1274.981s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This will probably be the 14th time that we've discussed this, and still no lighting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1280.045s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We've had situations there where a lady called up and she was afraid to get into a car because of people there, and also in a separate situation where a drug transaction was reported.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1289.572s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also right here in Medford Square, the Route 16 overpass, underpass on Route 93,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1294.71s">[Robert Penta]</a>: has no lights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1296.091s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Riverside Avenue, go underneath the overpass there, still no lights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1300.812s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have asked for the issue of public safety, timely street swiping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1305.514s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We've also asked for our crosswalk painting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1308.095s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're lucky if you see that once a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1310.856s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These aren't huge cost items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1312.756s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are items that are readily available within our budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1316.538s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now we've talked about police cameras and high visibility locations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1321.151s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Were it not for the business merchant that owned a store on the corner of George and Winthrop Street a few years, a couple of years back, how they caught the guy that assaulted the young lady from Tufts University.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1333.255s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of that, Mr. President, we all know that the cameras are beneficial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1338.22s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have $8,893 in our linkage account for where they could buy a few cameras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1343.764s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if you really want to get into it, we have $6,400,000 in our free cash account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1348.967s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I don't think there should be any reason why we can't go out there and buy any cameras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1354.371s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A bonus to our people that work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1357.433s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We can review the one day a week and swap day reward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1361.095s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that would be for those officers with a perfect attendance for six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1365.238s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Something different, something creative for the police officers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1368.706s">[Robert Penta]</a>: rather than the annual, it's on a six month basis, and that might work out, it's a tryout, it's something to think about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1376.55s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think we should also think about revisiting the idea of having retired police personnel be part of the parking enforcement proposal here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1384.815s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because that in and of itself, that in and of itself would bring a big luxury, not only to the people here in this community, but I think to the business people who would have a better idea of knowing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1397.748s">[Robert Penta]</a>: when and how to tag certain folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1400.089s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because we really don't know what this out-of-state company from Tennessee is going to be like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1404.952s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They could just be, I don't know, they're going to start at 7 o'clock in the morning to 7 at night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1408.674s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1410.115s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Boston doesn't even start till 8 o'clock in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1413.217s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have a civil defense system that needs to be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1416.418s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Since Mr. Mangone has passed on as its civil defense director, I don't know where it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1422.242s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it in limbo?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1423.122s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it going to be used?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1424.503s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If not,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1425.657s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We've talked about a snow emergency system, and we haven't heard anything back on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1429.099s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think we're all aware of the fact that a snow emergency system of some type needs to be in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1436.545s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And taking some of these issues and putting them on the left, then I go to the right, and I look at this idea of this new proposal that, if you agree or disagree, the mayor signed into effect apparently today regarding this Tennessee firm Republic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1455.834s">[Robert Penta]</a>: regarding a traffic enforcement program that's going to be six days a week from 7 in the morning to 7 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1462.839s">[Robert Penta]</a>: at night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1463.619s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There'll be no free parking on the streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1465.921s">[Robert Penta]</a>: According to the mayor's commentary, there's going to be two 30-minute parking spots in each one of the squares, and there'll be four paid single-space meter spots in each of the four square districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1481.652s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Other than that, there'll be kiosks allotted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1485.652s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's kind of like interesting because if you look at the commentary made by the director from the Medford Chamber of Commerce, Mr. White, he indicated that he was hoping that he would have an opportunity with its members to sit down and discuss this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1500.196s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he also made reference to the fact that each and every one of the squares have unique positions, unique concerns as it relates to businesses and how they might be affected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1509.459s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How the mayor came up to this resolution and signing, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1513.459s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But it's kind of like unfair because we were in that meeting on September 10th, and we were told that he would get back to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1520.742s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We were told that there'd be a public meeting for which this council voted seven to nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1524.724s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He never honored that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1526.345s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We were told also that the concerns that would be brought up would be addressed and to have an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1531.767s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know, and we don't really know what part of the business community, what businesses are going to be exempt from not having a meter or a kiosk anywhere in that particular area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1543.066s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You take these two things and you ask yourself, the Medford Police Department and public safety is such a huge issue here in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1550.709s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And some of the samples that I just talked about still have yet to be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1554.971s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the mayor thinks it's more important to go forward with a parking enforcement program, strike that, a paid to park program with enforcement that's only going to bring in $300,000 the first year and $700,000 from the second to the ninth year, it's the 10th year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1572.406s">[Robert Penta]</a>: May sound like a lot of money, but my feeling personally would have been, had the city decided to go forward after that meeting on the 10th, having an opportunity to listen to the folks within our community, listen to the business in the community, all four areas of this community, rather than have one size fits all, which includes Medford Square, in the press release as outlined tonight at 510,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1599.947s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just don't think it serves in the best interest of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1603.148s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think it helps our police department, and I don't think it gives the community in and of itself a fair shot as it relates to priorities that need to be addressed rather than another money enhancement for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1617.853s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, today, as you know, I'm assuming all of you know that the mayor signed this contract tonight around 517 or thereabouts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1628.397s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He signed the contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1629.758s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he makes a notation that the council was in support of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1634.7s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What the council was in support of was that on May 20th, when we had that meeting, we had agreed to the three vendors that came in, one would be selected, which was Republic from Tennessee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1645.264s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But we agreed to that somebody would come back after he had negotiations and we would discuss it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1651.107s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we did on September 10th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1652.988s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But when the pushback came back, the mayor decided not to go forward at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1657.709s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And speaking to Mr. Skelton,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1659.443s">[Robert Penta]</a>: are referring to Mr. Skelton's comments from Republic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1662.726s">[Robert Penta]</a>: From the 10th to the 25th of September, there was absolutely no communication between the mayor and Republic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1669.411s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So something had to take place from the 24th to today, the 7th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1673.915s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And taking that into consideration, it's quite obvious that the chamber's concerns, oh, I don't know who wrote the letter because we don't have a copy of the letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1681.081s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He says he got a letter from the chamber.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1682.963s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But when you have four separate squares, including Medford Square, which makes five, and their issues are all unique,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1688.854s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and they needed to be heard, and they weren't heard, and the mayor decides to have one size fits all, I don't think that's what you call a happy resolution, especially to the business people and to the taxpayers of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1700.818s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, the fact of the matter is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1705.679s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're getting rid of people who don't live in the community, who were parking at spots all day long, and they haven't been tagged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1713.322s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this has been going on for the entire years of the administration of this city, this mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1718.666s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now what we're going to be doing is tagging, if not towing, and telling our own taxpayers in this community, you people are going to have to start paying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1728.072s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, right up front, no free parking unless you are lucky enough to get one of those two spots in any one of the four or five sections of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1737.278s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where it's going, I don't know, Mr. President, but all I can tell you is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1741.381s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If I had to put my money on something, I would put it on public safety, the police department, the personnel that's needed to keep this community safe,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1749.039s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And more importantly, the subject matters that I brought up under the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1752.92s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Those to me are pressing needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1755.661s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They have no comparison, no comparison at all to a parking paid to park program or enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1763.163s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If the mayor was so concerned about that paid to park program and enforcement, he should have done it years ago, but he didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1768.884s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when they knew that people from Winchester and other communities were coming here and parking all day and not getting tagged and ticketed, he should have done something, but he didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1777.607s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1778.148s">[Robert Penta]</a>: put $300,000 this first year out of the box, compare everything to what the police department needs to keep our community safe and protected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1786.535s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's pale in comparison.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1788.436s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And with that being said, Mr. President, I just wanted to say that, um, I just think, you know, this council is either going to be committed to public safety and a new PlayStation and the police department, or this is nothing more than hot air every Tuesday night when we come here to talk about public safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1804.54s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have more than enough examples.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1806.622s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think we have more than enough good police officers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1810.865s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The shooting is just a drop in the bucket compared to all the drug problems that are existing throughout this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1816.609s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's a concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1818.07s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if they had more personnel, and if they could go to court, and if they had more of the mechanisms and the technology that is needed, it would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1828.597s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, when you talk to someone, you say, hey, you're building a brand new public works department, $14 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1835.258s">[Robert Penta]</a>: $14 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1835.858s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Still don't even have enough men to man it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1839.159s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you have a police department that's ready to fall apart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1841.539s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have an evidence room that's completely out of control and a whole host of other issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1847.641s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So, I would say, Mr. President and my fellow colleagues, that I think it's time that we take the stand and we tell the mayor we want a new police station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1856.362s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't care how you fund it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1857.863s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You found the money for a public works department, then find the money for a police station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1861.883s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because you're not going to make one seem to be more important than another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1865.046s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at the same time, you're not going to put the lives of this community and the folks in this community at risk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2711.653s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, um, I guess I missed this when I was reading it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2715.895s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you read the bottom of the mass comment, it says the chamber also acknowledged that there were several beneficial respects to the plan, such as user friendly kiosks, whatever that means.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2727.499s">[Robert Penta]</a>: After deliberating and discussing concerns raised by the business community, the mayor is recommending the following changes to the plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2735.962s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He's recommending,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2738.8s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This isn't a finality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2741.641s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you go to point number three, it says recommend $250,000 of the revenue generated on an annual basis to be dedicated to the business district improvements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2751.584s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a recommendation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2752.965s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This isn't a done deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2754.225s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you have $250,000, what district gets it first?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2757.506s">[Robert Penta]</a>: North Medford, South Medford, Boston Ave, Medford Square?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2761.447s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where's the determination there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2762.968s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then the last one, retain business and commuter permits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2765.609s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What does that mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2767.446s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All subjective commentary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2770.148s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't even know if this is really the done deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2773.031s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All he's doing, he's saying he signed it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2775.292s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I'm wondering if these are still things to be negotiated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2779.536s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He's recommending.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2781.057s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are recommendations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2783.759s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They may be just sticking to the original part of the plan and getting back to what Councilor Marks alluded to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2789.324s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Not only is it going to be aggressive enforcement,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2793.302s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But why would you start at 7 o'clock in the morning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2796.083s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Boston, which is much bigger than Medford, starts at 8.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2800.203s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Brookline, when they had their kiosks, they had to take them away because they were hurting the businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2806.344s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then if they're even recognizing by putting meters, single meters, in certain parts, well, maybe they should think about just putting meters, period, and see how that goes, and have local people do the enforcement part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2820.094s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the more I keep reading this thing, words stand off a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2823.136s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's the terminology that's used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2824.917s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He's recommending.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2826.037s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I don't even know if this is a done deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2827.758s">[Robert Penta]</a>: None of us know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2830.48s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's two 30-minute free parking spaces in West Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2835.243s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, who's in West Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2836.063s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who's it going to be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2836.763s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Has that been determined yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2837.684s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're going to flip a coin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2840.085s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Go to Boston Avenue, you're going to flip a coin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2842.587s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The whole length of that street, two free parking spaces?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2846.049s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then four paid single-space meter spots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2850.427s">[Robert Penta]</a>: in each of the above listed districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2853.969s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who's going to get those four?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2855.791s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as I said before, what businesses are going to be excluded rather than included?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2861.995s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, the law is very specific on this, and I said it to you last week, and I'll say it to you again, and I said it to our chief procurement officer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2869.72s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The responsibility of bringing the contract forward was from the chief procurement officer, not from the mayor, and not from the budget director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2878.205s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what the law says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2879.71s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there needed to be a recommendation in writing with a comparison of doing it in-house as compared to doing it out-house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2887.393s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in this situation, we never got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2889.733s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We never got the recommendation and how that recommendation was determined so as for the council to make a legitimate vote to go forward to accept it or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2900.137s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So there's a whole host of issues that surround not only the mayor signing this or even getting to the point to having him sign it, but the fact that he lied<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2909.696s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He lied to we, the people, by not coming and having the public forum for which seven members of this council voted on, to at least have a public forum, to at least have the business community, and at least have the taxpayers, the residents of the community, to come and speak up about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2924.399s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think we're all getting our emails, and people are just, once again, hearing about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2928.44s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Some of them, not that they're for it, not some of them against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2931.4s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They want to know more about it and how it's going to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2934.021s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But apparently, the mayor doesn't want us to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2936.707s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's quite obvious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2937.508s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He certainly doesn't want the taxpayers and the residents to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2940.449s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And however he chose what businesses that he met with, who knows what businesses they were that convinced him to go forward with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2947.554s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a damn shame, because I don't think this serves in the best interest of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3388.617s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I have four questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3390.378s">[Robert Penta]</a>: First of all, you said that they took your quote out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3394.301s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I'm going to read this quote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3395.322s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You tell me if it's accurate or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3397.363s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're going to let McGlynn quote, no, it's obvious to us that the different business districts have different needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3402.687s">[Robert Penta]</a>: White said, we're not going to advocate for any specific district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3406.39s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're going to provide opportunities through us to get those voices heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3409.752s">[Robert Penta]</a>: True or false?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3414.736s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if that's true, and you're recognizing the different needs of the different areas, how can you go along and have one size fits all for all four districts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3437.19s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3454.084s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's that part there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3456.446s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You said the chamber supports this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3457.887s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How many members in the chamber?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3480.727s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you have votes from the 200 plus members?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3484.168s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3484.868s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So how does the chamber make a decision?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3487.065s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you have membership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3489.427s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So your board of directors made this vote, not the membership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3503.515s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3504.196s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let's get this straight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3528.291s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You just made a comment at a minute ago that some of the people that are at that meeting on the 10th aren't members of the chamber.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3533.053s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3534.153s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So because someone is not a member of the chamber,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3537.096s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're not going to be looked upon with the same favor that somebody might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3540.218s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're a business person in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3548.804s">[Robert Penta]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3549.304s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You represent your members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3550.625s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you also said that the business community was aware of that meeting on the 20th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3554.828s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean on the 10th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3555.829s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3556.289s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3556.71s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At 117 in the afternoon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3558.131s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's when the emails went out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3560.632s">[Robert Penta]</a>: 117 of the day of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3562.814s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And a lot of people didn't even get it because they were still at work and not knowing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3566.209s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So that's not a well-advanced notice of people — of a public meeting regarding their living.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3571.051s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3575.694s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Kudlow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3580.957s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Kudlow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3581.957s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, Mr. President, I do want to get back to this thing that if Mr. White feels, on behalf of his membership, that this one-size-fits-all is going to address the concerns<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3594.167s">[Robert Penta]</a>: of the five separate, the four squares and the downtown method.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3597.949s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd like to have you explain that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3599.37s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How can this one size fits all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3671.357s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So then your quote in the paper was wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3673.779s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You did not indicate that each part of the city is unique.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3695.036s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, I think we need to get a report back that are these four points recommendations, or are they actually part of the contract?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3704.162s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because it's the mayor who uses the term, he's recommending changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3708.43s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't say it's not definitive, it's recommending.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3712.334s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And with that being said, with recommendations, I don't know if it's a contract or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3717.758s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4073.869s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Clerk, do you have enough poll workers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4095.344s">[Robert Penta]</a>: During the last election, there was some concern over some of the ballot boxes not working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4099.147s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is there any of these?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4102.988s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But aren't these all checked out before?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4105.169s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Oh yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4105.409s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4136.121s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Those all rechecked each and every election?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4138.782s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How does this work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4152.212s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And for the sake of a public announcement, Mr. President, when can people start getting an absentee ballot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4246.071s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, Dorothy, as we all know, is our wonderful assistant in the clerk's office with Mr. Finn, and she works very hard through the years, and she's now being able to enjoy her grandchild, her son's first child, which would be her grandchild,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4260.587s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we want to wish her the best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4665.085s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The only problem with the dog park has been the mayor is telling everyone it's going to cost $200,000 and he's telling people to go out and do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4672.391s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, I mean, how do you turn around and tell the people you go out and get the dog park?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4676.935s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as Councilor Marks alluded to before, you know, RF Whiting Company,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4680.72s">[Robert Penta]</a>: according to the mayor, was supposed to give the money for the dog park, and they never did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4684.162s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now he's telling the people, you've got to raise the $200,000 if you really want this dog park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4689.904s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He knows how to raise money for everything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4693.426s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4695.047s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think the good part is maybe, Mr. Clerk, if we have just a single number they can call the clerk's office, and maybe you should have a stack of petitions there if people come in, because that's where the licenses are as well, too, to pick up a license in your office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4710.845s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I can't generate the petitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4712.306s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4713.427s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If petitions are left in your office, if petitions are left in your office and somebody wants to come and pick them up, they can pick them up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4719.731s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think that may be a good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4723.553s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Central point in the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4807.91s">[Robert Penta]</a>: President, yesterday, well, I think it was yesterday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4812.873s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I got mine yesterday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4813.733s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Other people may have got it the day before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4815.754s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We all received in the mail our new water bill, and we also received a letter from the city indicating to the city of Medford water and sewer customers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4826.601s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, the letter is undated,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4829.036s">[Robert Penta]</a>: right there in and of itself tends to indicate a lack of professionalism in the letter going out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4837.779s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There was no notice of a public meeting or an agenda item on this particular matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4843.801s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The Medford City Council not only has talked about it, but at our April meeting of this year, we had a resolution that was offered by myself and passed by the seven members of the council to have the cemetery, no, excuse me,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4858.663s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The Water and Soil Commission has appeared before the council and to explain this new idea of tiered rates and commercial rates or whatever it might be and however it's going to take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4869.312s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4870.793s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Unfortunately, the mayor sends an answer back and says it's the council's purview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4876.618s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, it's the Water and Soil Commission's purview to make that decision, number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4881.141s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And number two, this is a matter that involves the entire city for the purposes of being involved and getting involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4889.346s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The council has asked on numerous occasions for the Water and Soil Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4893.609s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I personally have met with the chairman of the Water and Soil Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4897.272s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I asked him to come here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4898.353s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're still waiting for him to come here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4901.376s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The mayor has never offered a public meeting or a hearing on this particular increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4907.22s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So there is a complete lack of public education on this increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4911.664s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of this, we have problems here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4916.408s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Look at your bill that just came out, and it talks about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4920.526s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The rates only apply to homes with up to four families and residential condo buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4926.05s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then it gives you a 0 to 800 as a base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4929.493s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I don't know where they got that 800 as being the base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4932.215s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Again, no determination from that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4934.196s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then from 800 cubic feet to 1,600 feet, you get to another rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4938.62s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it goes on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4939.54s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And after that, there's a third rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4941.222s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So as a residential owner, you could have up to three types of rates in your particular house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4946.646s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then it goes down further to indicate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4949.122s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Every other person or every other type of an account will be charged 0.138.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4954.786s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, does that mean that that's going to be a commercial rate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4960.309s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I thought we were led to believe that there was going to be allegedly a commercial rate, which would be different than the regular rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4967.853s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if you go back to the first paragraph, they talk about they're adopting this in response to Chapter 165, Section 2B.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4972.836s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And 165, Section 2B is very explicit<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4979.343s">[Robert Penta]</a>: where it talks about, shall institute water charges and fees that incorporate a base rate for all, provided, which means other than or maybe, that said base rate shall be increased at an increased block rate to fairly reflect the resource demand and consumption of high volume uses of water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5002.576s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now think about high volume uses of water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5007.475s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you live in a three-family house, for the example that they use, you are a single person on the first floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5014.861s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There is two, three people on the third floor, five or six people on the third floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5019.425s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they use the example you used, 2,100 units of water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5023.068s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, they're going to take the 2,100 units of water, divide it by three, and everybody's going to be tagged with 700 units of water to be charged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5031.936s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That doesn't make any sense at all, number one, because number one,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5036.306s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Not everybody has a meter in their apartment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5038.346s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if it's a single meter that's going to cover the whole house, some houses are like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5043.948s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, how do you distribute that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5046.508s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, where they come up with this, I have absolutely no idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5050.969s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this is what prompted probably eight or nine of my 13 calls that I've already received so far in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5056.65s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How do they make this type of a determination?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5058.751s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But more importantly, personally, I think this is the mayor's way of retaliating against the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5064.619s">[Robert Penta]</a>: because we didn't give him his $600,000 in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5067.981s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Bad enough we didn't give him his parking garage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5070.103s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of that, this rate increase not only will pick up the $600,000, it'll probably exceed that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5077.168s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Absolutely, absolutely not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5080.15s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It is not right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5081.751s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At the present time, people should be aware of the fact, at the present time, in our water and sewer retained earnings account, we have $8,400,000 as of today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5096.533s">[Robert Penta]</a>: $8,400,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5098.275s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We would have $9,600,000 if we didn't take a million two a few years ago to take the mayor out of his deficit hole because he couldn't balance the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5107.762s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But with that being said, $8 million, that's a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5113.366s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we're talking about rate payers having to be charged right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5117.549s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There is nothing in this letter that would even give you an assumption<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5122.301s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that it's going to take place next year, or the next billing cycle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5125.963s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They just jam it in the letter, and there it is in your new bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5131.046s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, I went back, and to my knowledge, the last time in billing cycles in 2006, as compared to the bills that we have right now, the 2006 bill, sixth bill, tells you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5144.895s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The cost, it breaks it down for water and sewer, the cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5149.277s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Your water and sewer cost is not broken down in these blue bills that we've been getting for a long period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5155.381s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of that, I'm going to suggest in part, Mr. President, that the city's water and sewer department and the city of Medford building department reinstitute the prior building process that not only showed the prior readings, the present readings, the usage,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5173.311s">[Robert Penta]</a>: but the rates for water and the rates for sewer per 100 cubic feet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5177.955s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the people have an informed, knowledgeable bill, rather than getting a dollar amount and trying to figure out the hocus pocus that's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5187.281s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Baseline water usage of 800, where do they get that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5190.484s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I have absolutely no idea who determined, and they don't even tell you where it came from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5197.089s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The bill, as I said before, it doesn't ID the water and sewer rates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5200.435s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But back and prior to 2006, it did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5202.977s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It gives you everything that you would want to know to try to figure out your bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5208.221s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, your old rate consumption as compared to your new rate consumption, that's another thing that's not on here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5214.767s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because all they're doing and they're telling you on the blue bill, it's just telling you what you had last time, what the reading was, and the amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5226.276s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And once again, what's water, what's sewer, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5232.566s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think what really needs to be done on this particular issue is two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5237.55s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can't send out bills to people and just tell them it becomes effective now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5243.555s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5244.315s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number two, you don't send out a letter that's undated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5247.197s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number three, you don't turn around and tell, for an example, a three-family house, you're going to split it between the three floors, and everyone's going to pay the same amount on a per-unit charge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5256.965s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5258.806s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Second of all, there's nothing on this bill<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5261.719s">[Robert Penta]</a>: on this letter that talks about a commercial rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5266.141s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think Councilor Marks, is he here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5268.382s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think there was an issue relative to a commercial rate before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5271.543s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, where are we going with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5273.664s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It says all other rates will be 0.1381.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5275.925s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that will be the same rate as someone who goes from the 800 to the 1600 level in a residential home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5285.829s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I said it before and I'll say it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5287.97s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If families are going to be penalized because they have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5291.272s">[Robert Penta]</a>: children or mothers and fathers or seniors living with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5295.695s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5297.036s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's absolutely not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5298.497s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as the law says, the resources should go on the demand and the consumption of high volume uses of water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5307.063s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A residential home, maybe just over this 800 level or whatever it might be, those aren't high uses of water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5314.828s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's baseline wherever they got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5317.089s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe the zero to 800.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5318.769s">[Robert Penta]</a>: should be maybe the $0 to $1,200 or $1,400, and then change it after that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5323.911s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because I don't think it's bad enough rate payers, you're hitting them with a federal tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5327.672s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You hit them with your state tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5329.013s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You hit them with a meals tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5330.033s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're hitting them with a gas tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5331.614s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You hit them with your real estate tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5333.494s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now you want to raise their water and sewer tax with an $8.4 million surplus sitting in a kitty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5341.717s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5343.358s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is not what the council asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5345.318s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe this is the mayor's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5347.443s">[Robert Penta]</a>: way of getting back at the council because $600,000 was taken out of the budget for which the council voted for to knock off the 10% rate increase?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5357.691s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, this rate increase is definitely going to exceed the 10% that the mayor was losing, or the $600,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5364.436s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And who's going to pay for it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5366.638s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's the everyday person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5368.779s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would strongly suggest, Mr. President, once again, as we did in August, if the mayor says this is within the purview of the council,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5376.84s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then let it be in the purview and strike that respectfully request that the Board of Commissioners appear before the Medford City Council for the purposes of explaining not only the letter, but the rates as to where we're going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5389.863s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And also respectfully request that they change their billing process to accurately show the rate for water, the rate for sewer, where it's going, and the amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5400.945s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now with that being said, Mr. President,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5403.911s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I can't find anyone, and I'm still waiting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5405.872s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I had a long talk today with Mr. Remsburg, who was the chief legal counsel for the MWRA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5411.994s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in my conversation with him, which represented the same type of conversation I had with him in August of this past year, we're back to the same issue for which I believe we're on the same page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5422.577s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The bigger users, the demand for bigger users and demand for more consumption and high volume of users of water should be the first ones, according to this chapter of the law, to be paid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5433.882s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It says, all municipalities and water districts within the jurisdiction of the MWRA, but not including community service by the Connecticut Valley Aqueduct, shall institute water charges and fees that incorporate a base rate for all users.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5450.174s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5450.854s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're saying 800 is the base rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5453.176s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But it says, provided that said base rate shall be increased at an increasing block rate to fairly recollect<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5461.909s">[Robert Penta]</a>: the resources, demand, and consumption of high-volume uses of water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5467.072s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If somebody is 801, is they going to be tagged as a high-volume use of water?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5472.074s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because that person at 801, which could be residential, is going to be tagged at the same amount that everyone else is going to be tagged that's not residential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5482.059s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you're going to have to assume it's commercial, because they don't say it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5484.741s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But what is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5487.082s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Everybody else but residential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5488.703s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's got to be commercial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5490.463s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So with that being said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5492.191s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think this needs to be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5494.312s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think somebody needs to be here to address it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5496.474s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think the billing needs to be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5498.215s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And more importantly, I think it's absolutely unfair that somebody would put a, an increase in your bill on the same time that goes out with no public education, no public notice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5511.223s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, this is three strikes that the mayor has given to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5515.926s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He's taking money away from people on cable access on Verizon and Comcast bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5521.547s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He's sitting on $303,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5522.448s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's sitting downstairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5525.489s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He just now signs, he just now signs a pay to park program that didn't have one public hearing here for the taxpayers to talk about and discuss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5534.955s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And thirdly, he's now hitting you with a new tax on your water and sewer charge with no public input, no public information, no public hearing or anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5545.34s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's three strikes since the summer of this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5549.028s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How much more is it that the people of this community want to take?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5552.35s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When are you going to realize that your open government is not open like you think it is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5557.532s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And your notorious government is as notorious as it can be, because there's no transparency as to what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5565.216s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This letter should have been ID'd with a date, and it should have addressed itself DMF resident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5572.16s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In the near future, giving it the date, your bill will be going up the following, and it'll give the reason why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5578.325s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the insanity of saying that a three-family or a two-family or a four-family house is going to be divided by the amount of units, and that's what they're going to pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5587.372s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They have no right saying that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5588.413s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They have no right doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5589.874s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'm moving that our Board of Water and Soil Commissioners appear before the Medford City Council to discuss this particular matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5743.391s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I hear what Councilor Knight is talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5746.032s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My point of clarification is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5747.513s">[Robert Penta]</a>: While he may be running off a string of resolutions, we had asked for a public hearing and a public meeting on this and for whatever<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5755.629s">[Robert Penta]</a>: the Water and Soil Commissioners might have done or made the determination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5759.652s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The council has been asked to be apprised, and they've been asked to appear before here, and they never have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5765.217s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So 800 getting to the baseline, how did you get to it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5769.16s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where did you come up with that number?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5770.961s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because if you look at a lot of the residential homes, they're going to be between 800 and that 1,600 mark.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5776.326s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So by going over by one cubic feet, you're going to be putting that residential homeowner, who might have two or three kids or taking care of a senior citizen, paying a higher rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5786.059s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's where I think the discussion needs to take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5789.82s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm not denying the fact that the more you use, the more you should pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5794.121s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But this is a big gap from $800 to $800 to $1,600.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5798.603s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you are just a little bit over that, you're going to be saddled with that additional thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5802.984s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And again, as I said, if somebody has multiple people living in their family home, they're going to be penalized for using the water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5809.005s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If they use a dramatic amount, that's one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5926.949s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah, clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5927.669s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5928.549s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I hear what Councilor Knight is alluding to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5930.53s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The point is valid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5932.711s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It went from zero to 1,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5934.131s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why did it come down to 800?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5935.812s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, if you speak to some of the members, they're going to turn around and tell you, this is part of the conservation mode of saving water and within families and stuff like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5944.434s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Which I wholeheartedly support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5945.875s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5946.315s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I don't think anybody's going to deny the fact that, you know, you don't want to penalize people because they have people living in their homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5952.81s">[Robert Penta]</a>: who might be seniors or elderly or babies or two or three children or for whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5958.957s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I would be not in favor of having a subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5963.002s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would be in favor of just having, calling for the public hearing and have them come in and explain it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5967.007s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They've already mean what they did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5969.149s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And one point further, and I think as a Councilor, Councilor Marks, I think we had this conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5974.636s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Getting to the point of the households, as Councilor Knight has just alluded to, how did you make this determination?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5981.902s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where are the numbers of those homes that are between 0 to 800, and from 800 to 1,600, and over that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5989.069s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They have to have statistics to do that, because if they just decided to go to 800 because it sounded good, because it was a good conservation move, well, that's not good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5998.536s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If there's people between 800 and 850, whatever it might be, there's nothing wrong with going to 1,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6002.859s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, that's a compromise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6004.199s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I got no problem with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6005.56s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I want to see these numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6007.781s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I want to see these numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6033.314s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you for your point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6034.315s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just remind councilor Dello Russo, one thing we had asked at one point in time,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6039.093s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to have our city engineer appear before the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6041.393s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And she didn't come because the mayor told her not to come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6043.934s">[Robert Penta]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6044.474s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So we can ask the Water and Soil Commissioners to come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6047.995s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if they choose not to come because they're told not to come, where does that put the council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6534.51s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Point of clarification, Councilor Penta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6536.29s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The law says explicitly if the estimated income is more than the total appropriations, the excess shall be appropriated to a separate reserve fund and used for capital expenditures of the enterprise subject to the appropriation or to reduce user charges if authorized by the appropriate entity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6554.602s">[Robert Penta]</a>: responsible for operations of the enterprise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6559.265s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He can the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6561.047s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6705.164s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, also the letter indicates further down that they're going to keep this baseline rate for the first year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6711.988s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the intention is that they're going to be going up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6714.749s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So with that being said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6716.6s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm going to make the request that the Board of Water and Soil Commissioners appear before the Medford City Council to discuss this letter that went out that's unsigned, undated, as it represents, and that a new bill be forthcoming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6735.186s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They revised the bill that includes the rate for the water and the rate for the sewage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6742.961s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and along with the total amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6744.823s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, the letter negates to put in here that it's nothing more than the new use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6749.746s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They don't have the old use by consumption and water and sewer charges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6754.25s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think that would be, once again, pure transparency for the rate payers at least to see what's going on other than, once again, just getting a letter saying, you know, this is what you're going to have to pay and your rates are going up and, you know, with no clarification, absolutely no education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6769.241s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There was absolutely nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6770.863s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You notice that the mayor did not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6772.885s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Listen, the Board of Soil Commissioners worked for the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6775.266s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're his appointments on that board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6777.208s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The mayor owns this one as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6778.609s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is his responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6780.27s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If he knew the rates were going up, for which they have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6783.332s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if this is his end run to circumvent this council, because this council wouldn't give him his parking garage and wouldn't give him his $600,000 in the budget for 10% water rate increase, this is certainly the wrong way to go, especially with $8.4 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6799.722s">[Robert Penta]</a>: sitting in the surplus account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6801.564s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That is just so wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6803.926s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, you're ripping off the taxpayers once again, Mr. Mayor, knowing that their money is just sitting in an account to make you look good at a bond rating at the expense of the taxpayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6816.956s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe they'd like to enjoy some of that money and spend it on their family or their kids or what have you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6822.481s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So with that being said, I move the question, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6870.323s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I can go either way because it's obvious that this has already been done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6873.446s">[Robert Penta]</a>: From the documents that I have secured from the Water and Sewer Commission, they've been talking about this since April of this past year with the city engineer and Mr. Woodcock, the MWRA, the legal counsel, and what have you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6884.707s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So their determination has already been made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6886.628s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My question is going to be very simple and germane, basically what we had here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6890.209s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, the one thing, you know, they're saying that they cannot make the recommendation to reduce the water and sewer rates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6899.713s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, if they can't make the recommendation to reduce it, how can they make the recommendation to increase it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6904.535s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6905.816s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The law doesn't prohibit them from doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6907.916s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And with an $8.4 million surplus, in the best interest of this community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6912.062s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It would have been a wonderful exposure by the Water and Soil Commission to recommend to the mayor that we not increase and we take this out of the Water and Soil account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6920.269s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But as we all know, this is the mayor's board, and they're going to do whatever the mayor tells them to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6924.793s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I can go either way on the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6994.682s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor Penta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6995.722s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6996.202s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I got no problem with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6999.349s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We only have three more meetings between now and we're off for two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7002.271s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I would request that this meeting take place within the next two to three week, next two to three meetings that were available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7008.496s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But in the meantime, if we could have some information forwarded to us so we could at least know the proposed that they're giving us here, how they got to this baseline of 800, if we could get some information on how they got to that, if we get some information ahead of time, once again, what's the old rate compared to the new rates?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7029.825s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And something as it relates to, you know, revising the bill that includes the water rates for water and sewer usage and the dollar amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7039.671s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So at least when somebody gets it, they could figure it out rather than just getting numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7044.033s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then the conversation on that particular night would just basically, you know, figure out the tiered rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7051.158s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This lacks the word commercial rate in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7054.219s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It says all other, all other establishments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7059.485s">[Robert Penta]</a>: which I'm assuming is going to be commercial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7062.327s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We'll find that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7063.709s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if we could have that and a roll call vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=114.915s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On that motion, Councilor Dello Russo's amendment, we just got a notice I think today relative to a meeting that's going to take place on June 3rd by the folks that are doing the work over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=125.444s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So that may be something you may want to bring up for the purpose of letting them pay to do the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=132.649s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So it's in your, pardon me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=134.09s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You want to amend that further?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=134.891s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah, amend it further, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=137.383s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why don't you repeat that again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=138.705s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The amendment is that the Department of Transportation is having a public meeting on June 3rd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=142.97s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe it's in Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=144.432s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We got a notice today in our emails.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=146.474s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's one of six locations, that's the next one coming up, and that will make reference to Councilor Camuso's and Councilor De La Rosa's thoughts relative to Medford Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=869.451s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On that motion, could we get a copy of where the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=875.071s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Dog packs and the amount of money was supposed to be coming from October of 2011.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=879.395s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The mayor made a public announcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=883.058s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We've been talking about dog packs since 2011, because that was supposed to have been part of the mitigation that F.W.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=889.884s">[Robert Penta]</a>: White, or J.F.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=890.605s">[Robert Penta]</a>: White, was supposed to be giving the city of Medford for the FAST-14.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=893.847s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So we've never seen the dog pack.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=896.169s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Could we just get the handle on what that mitigation terminology was on dog packs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=901.957s">[Robert Penta]</a>: $50,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=902.077s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I have no idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1230.836s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President last Tuesday night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1232.357s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Um, I thought we had a very informative conversation and after I went back and I reviewed the tape, um, I, I, I think to some degree we will mislead or at least I was misled because I asked the question as a related is the new location on Salem street going to have the capacity<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1249.502s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to do a broadcast from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1251.983s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the answer was yes from the manager of the station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1257.945s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, subsequent to that, immediately following the meeting, the transmission of the module, or whatever you want to call the terminology, was in the corner of the room over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1267.888s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the conversation finally alluded to the fact that on Riverside Avenue, there is absolutely no Comcast, and there is no Verizon capacity to do broadcasting or to bring cable in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1279.687s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, if you remember correctly, Mr. President, it was you who brought up this issue, I think some five to seven years ago, relative to a business client on High Street who was trying to get Comcast, I think, or Verizon, into the building over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1295.113s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was Comcast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1296.774s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at that point in time, I believe there was, in our conversation, I believe we had someone from Channel 3, and I don't know who, so I don't want to mention any names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1308.291s">[Robert Penta]</a>: because I'd be absolutely wrong, but I remember somebody from Channel 3 indicating that that was one of the problems that we had in Medford Square, the inability or the lack of capacity to have broadcasting in the downtown Medford Square area, which seems to be pretty kind of evident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1320.658s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, again, from the conversation that took place last Tuesday night and from the information that was ascertained, there is a two-year contract signed, I believe, at 32 Salem Street, Riverside Avenue, excuse me,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1333.507s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's no Comcast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1334.348s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's no Verizon there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1336.109s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So how do you broadcast out of have a full-fledged studio if you don't have that capacity to broadcast from there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1343.775s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So what's going on now, if I understand all of this correctly, is the modular transmission, lack of terminology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1350.441s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know the proper terminology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1352.362s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But it's here in this particular building, or it was brought here in this particular building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1357.406s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know if it's still here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1358.902s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the whole idea is that the transmission would come from Verizon or Comcast to City Hall, and then they would somehow bounce it to 32 Riverside Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1369.727s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I'm saying to myself, well, wait a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1371.308s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What is this all about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1373.629s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is not having a full-fledged studio that's equipped on its own merits at its own location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1379.251s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then I started to think about this thing even more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1380.952s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I'm saying to myself, we have a concern here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1384.054s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're putting channel-free equipment into Medford City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1387.915s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And by putting Channel 3 equipment into Medford City Hall, are we talking about having a liability issue here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1393.379s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Are we talking about the equipment here in City Hall?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1395.881s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Are we talking about the access to City Hall?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1398.062s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The keys and who would have keys to City Hall?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1400.184s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who would be coming into City Hall if, in fact, something were to go wrong in the transmission from City Hall to 32 Riverside Avenue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1408.009s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there's a whole host of questions here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1409.471s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the city has a liability policy as it relates to being a self-insured.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1413.433s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, we all know that Channel 3 is a separate private nonprofit corporation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1417.611s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So, I mean, we have two separate entities here running around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1421.674s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We were also told at that point in time that there was, I believe, less than $100,000 operating budget that they were operating in, but there is another budget for whatever that might be worth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1434.682s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I tried to get down there on two separate occasions on Riverside Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1437.624s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Both times I couldn't get in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1438.845s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Both times the door was locked, but on one particular day,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1442.022s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The paper was down, I did have a chance to look in, and it didn't look like there was hardly any work, if any work at all was taking place down there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1447.724s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now this goes back to March of this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1450.345s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So now we have a station manager that's getting paid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1452.586s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have no transmission, no broadcasting coming forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1455.628s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have, for whatever the reason might be, if in fact the city of Medford is now being a part of whatever Channel 3 is going to be involved with, if the mayor is doing this, I have no idea why Channel 3 would even be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1467.031s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and entertaining City Hall, but more importantly, why would they even want to stay on Riverside Avenue with no access to cable television, Verizon or Comcast?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1477.038s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, poor choice, they've been around, they know the situation, they know what Medford Square is about, they know what Riverside Ave is all about, and that was a poor choice to go there, especially being in the business for, they're not novice, these people that are working there, and they're a part of Channel 3, they've been around for a while, they know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1495.424s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And since they know what's going on, the sad part about this is they've got themselves locked into a contract for which I would assume, I would hope that they would be able to get out of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1503.169s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And even if they had to get sued, who cares about getting sued?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1506.211s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Look at the time that you're costing the city, the taxpayers, each of the rate payers, each and every cable bill are paying for something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1512.096s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're paying for station manager that has no job to do because there's nothing being programmed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1516.038s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's nothing being taped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1517.878s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then it dawned on me yesterday while we were at the cemetery and we were listening to the speeches being made and watching the people that were there and the observance, where is all this portable equipment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1528.108s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The portable equipment that Channel 3 has had through the years from the thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars that subscribers have not only paid, but the city of Medford has transferred over to Channel 3 through the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1541.872s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They could have had people out there with portable cameras doing the portable televising of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1546.456s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then, if in fact, and when they do come back on, that they would have a whole host of things to put on, the Memorial Day service, graduations, whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1555.763s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't see any of that around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1557.825s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then we were told there's 10 board of directors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1559.627s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I have no idea who the board of directors are, and I would hope they would come forward and let us know who these board of directors are so we could get a handle on what the makeup of the board is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1569.206s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then, I believe one of the situations that came up, going back and reviewing Judge Jackson's report, that the city paid over $15,000 on, Melanson and Heath, the city's auditor, on one particular year, going back, I believe it was just before or after Judge Jackson, indicated there was, on a $15,000 account, $5,000 was totally unaccounted for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1587.324s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No receipts, no records, totally unaccounted for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1593.157s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now I know I see one of the folks sitting in the audience, I don't know which one it is, but I know he came to the podium one night and he said it was a combination of sloppy bookkeeping, not keeping the records accurate, but we're going to do a better job and all of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1606.01s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, our resolution last week was to ask for an audit, a complete audit on channel three for the last three years and have that forwarded to the city because the rate payers really have no other alternative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1617.708s">[Robert Penta]</a>: but to either go to the mirror.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1618.928s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's obvious that the mirror is either failing to do anything, doesn't want to do anything, afraid to do something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1624.93s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the people's voice, which is at this podium right now, is nothing more than asking, what is really going on over there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1632.052s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, why would you want to put a TV station for cable subscribers for public access at a location that has no accessibility to the cable?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1643.836s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1644.636s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number two, why wasn't that thought out ahead of time<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1647.216s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to know that cable access could not go there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1649.578s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And number three, more importantly, you know, they should go out and find another spot and think about what really cable access is here within this community and what it should be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1658.265s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because the taxpayers and the rate payers, as Councilor Caraviello alluded to last Tuesday night, they're getting ripped off each and every month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1664.65s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There should be an accounting for that money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1666.211s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There should be a credit coming back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1667.952s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the City of Medford should not be holding that money available for Channel 3 if they're not broadcasting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1672.984s">[Robert Penta]</a>: People are getting paid for doing no work, because there's no work to be done over there, and there's no broadcasting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1678.367s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So, with that being said, Mr. President, I think we really need to get an answer from our city solicitor as it relates to, is the city of Medford using a public building for the purposes of having transmission out of this building to 32 Riverside Avenue for the purposes of having public access cable television?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1697.556s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if that's the case, what is, if any, legal ramifications that might be involved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1702.605s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let's go back to the other issue, Mr. Clark, who comes into the building, who's going to handle the phone calls, who's going to have a set of keys, who's going to be responsible for the equipment, who's going to be responsible for the city's equipment, who's going to be responsible for what's in this building if somebody from Channel 3 or one of their designees comes into this building for whatever the reasons might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1722.009s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's the sad part about not having this all in one place with the ability to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1727.66s">[Robert Penta]</a>: accessed in and out of one place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1729.661s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And to come here in City Hall now, after the fact, having whatever the tenure was in 5 High Street, whatever that lawsuit might be all about, whatever the reason why they left there, it doesn't make any sense that they would go to another place that gives them less opportunity for the purposes of broadcasting on a daily basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1747.69s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On motion to Councilor Penta, Vice President Del Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2051.672s">[Robert Penta]</a>: While you might be autonomous legally,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2054.366s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You are taking ratepayers' money for which the mayor of this community overrides your corporation, because he administers Channel 3.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2062.451s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He's the executive director, and technically, of your Channel 3.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2066.413s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But he's not taking any action for whatever the reason is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2069.615s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you feel as though it's your duty to go ahead and take action?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2073.017s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's my duty to let the taxpayer, ratepayer know that that Channel 3 is not operating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2077.64s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It should be operating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2078.941s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there is something wrong, especially when you're bringing equipment into this building<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2082.574s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and trying to make the modular or the transmission go from here to there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2085.695s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why didn't you just go to another place that had access?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2095.757s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's nothing to be confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2096.838s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Don't play the game tonight, Frank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2098.018s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The bottom line is you're in a place that you had no right going to because there was no access, and you've taken two months worth of ratepayers' money that they're paying each and every<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2105.993s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're paying people at work that have no job to go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2109.595s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, let me give you the history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2111.036s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The history is this, Frank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2112.417s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Frank, Frank, the history is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2115.719s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He hasn't earned my respect, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2117.7s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, you haven't earned mine either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2120.801s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's on Riverside Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2121.982s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're in a place that does not have access to cable, Verizon, or Comcast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2126.124s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're not operating, and the tax rate payers in this community are not getting their money's worth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2130.267s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's the bottom line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2131.567s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2132.688s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So why did you go there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2133.729s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Answer that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2134.749s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why did you go to a place knowing that there was no access?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2159.226s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, who are the board of directors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2160.887s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He said there was 10 of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2161.928s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do you know the 10 of them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2162.849s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who said there were 10?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2164.45s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Sano, your director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2167.392s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, that's what he said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2168.272s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He told us they were 10.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2176.316s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let me give a little history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2177.676s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let me give a little history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2179.197s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Poleri, Mr. Poleri, Mr. Poleri, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2183.259s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Poleri, how many board of directors do you have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2189.481s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, how many do you have right now, active?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2191.803s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I want to say six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2192.844s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2193.885s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So your station manager was wrong when he said 10.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2201.17s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, that's what he said, 10.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2213.358s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, I don't want any history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2214.619s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, we're not here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2216.16s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2217.438s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The resolution's not about a history of TV3 to dance around the subject.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2220.52s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The subject matter is very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2222.221s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The rate payers have no one to go to, because the mayor is not doing anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2225.843s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So when they come to a council or a council law— Well, that's for you to discuss with the mayor, isn't it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2232.547s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes, it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2235.549s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You may be autonomous in your mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2237.851s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In your mind, you might be autonomous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2239.673s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you are using ratepayers' money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2244.817s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're taking ratepayers' money that the mayor is giving to you because of the contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2249.942s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you have no access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2251.083s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's no television.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2252.123s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's no broadcasting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2253.625s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're paying for people that don't have a job to go to for two months plus more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2257.008s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Tell me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2261.209s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah, I'm really serious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2267.751s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, tell me why you're not broadcasting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2269.071s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Once again, you're ridiculous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2270.132s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why are you not broadcasting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2270.792s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And for you to come down there to a building to try to get in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2273.473s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why are you not broadcasting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2274.293s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Tell me why you're not broadcasting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2275.213s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have my phone number, Robert Diamond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2276.414s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Tell me why you're not broadcasting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2278.254s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I will talk one-on-one with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2279.675s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why aren't you broadcasting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2280.735s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Tell me why you're not broadcasting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2282.335s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor, I'm not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2283.056s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why are you not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2284.036s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He has to answer the question, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2292.695s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Point of information, I wanna know why you're not broadcasting it on Riverside Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2297.979s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Answer it, I don't want a long history, just tell me the reason why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2300.34s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All right, go ahead, go ahead with your statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2301.901s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What's your answer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2367.035s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Point of information, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2368.735s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Point of information, Councilor Powell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2369.976s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Quick question for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2371.256s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why did you move from 5 High Street to 32 Riverside Avenue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2379.874s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you're having issues at 5 High Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2384.777s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2385.597s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I also know that the city's Board of Health went down there too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2388.158s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes, I do know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2389.859s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We had to move for the safety of our members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2392.32s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just answer a simple question, Frank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2395.482s">[Robert Penta]</a>: 32 Riverside Ave does not have Verizon or Comcast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2398.603s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why did you go there knowing that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2401.104s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You went there knowing it didn't have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2473.079s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Point of information, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2475.66s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why did you bring your transmitter over here last week and have it stored here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2478.421s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because you were going to transmit here and then from here it's going to bounce back there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2481.123s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why'd you do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2495.953s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you cannot broadcast legitimately on your own at 32 Riverside Avenue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2500.315s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2501.795s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Forget City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2505.557s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You cannot do it, Frank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2507.118s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You just got through saying there's a feed here, which is going to allow you to broadcast them there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2512.14s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You cannot go to 32 Riverside Avenue on its own without City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2516.002s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You need City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2516.722s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's the bottom line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2530.495s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So why don't you just go someplace that had cable accessibility?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2554.466s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilman Iacocca, so a few years ago, five, six years ago, brought up that issue, and your people were here one night when we had a discussion on how Cable Comcast was being broadcast, and as a matter of fact, it went all the way to Haines Square, and it was a business person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2568.589s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Remember, who's the person?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2572.8s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My belief is Riverside Avenue going up to High Street is not wired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2576.904s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Was not wired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2590.278s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You mentioned High Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2591.579s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what I said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2595.48s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, you weren't specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2596.8s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You said High Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2597.92s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2598.34s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Five High Streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2599.161s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Bottom line is you're wasting taxpayers' money, ratepayers' money by being in a place, you're not broadcasting, there's nothing going on over there, you're paying a station manager and one other person for nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2612.344s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There is nothing going on for him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2614.565s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2629.393s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Point of information, Mr. President, have you got any legal opinion from a city solicitor as it relates to the liability, if anything, and how this is all going to work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2637.958s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Have you discussed this with the city solicitor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2639.919s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I have a meeting tomorrow with the mayor and the solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2642.701s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So in other words, you're going ahead, making an assumption over here by going into construction and spending money, but you haven't met with the city manager, I mean, the mayor and the solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2652.727s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you went ahead, ahead of time, two months ago, going in there, and now you just decide to go to the city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2661.27s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why is it inaccurate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2662.431s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You just said you're meeting tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2670.279s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the Mayor has given you his blessing to put your equipment in this building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2673.543s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is that what you're saying?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2674.224s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's essentially correct, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2676.426s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The Mayor of Medford said to you, Frank Palleri, Board of Directors at Channel 3, you can put your<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2682.645s">[Robert Penta]</a>: your equipment here and broadcast from here to that studio.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2714.261s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Point of further information, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2717.403s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You just used the word, hopefully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2720.805s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Give the same services, hopefully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2722.886s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2723.459s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The word hopefully should never have even been used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2725.82s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It should have been able to say, to provide the same services, period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2741.247s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But to get here and there, you keep saying here and there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2744.348s">[Robert Penta]</a>: City Hall is supposed to be a part of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2749.673s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2752.556s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, I just think there's a liability issue here and I think there's an issue that the city needs to address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2769.069s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Don't tell me what I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2771.671s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Grandstanding?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2772.331s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2772.792s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is what you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2773.532s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is what you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2775.073s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You coming up here and making a big example of what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2779.716s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The bottom line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2780.177s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So let me go ahead and give a step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2781.378s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2789.771s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Point of further information, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2792.717s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You keep saying you're in the process of building what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2795.563s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't have the ability to transmit out of there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2798.429s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What are you building?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2806.338s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you can't transmit from the internet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2815.084s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't care about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2816.325s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I care about- How do you think they transmit over- Keep your voice down, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2819.507s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I care about Channel 3 and the subscribers paying for the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2931.302s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, if you're going to have this ability to come into this building because your equipment is here, what do you expect the city to do if you have to come in here<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2942.455s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and the building is closed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2944.517s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do you expect to get keys to the city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2987.134s">[Robert Penta]</a>: City Hall closes at 12.30 on a Friday, you have Monday through Friday, so if God forbid something had happened, you'd be down all weekend, whereas if you were in a location,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2996.087s">[Robert Penta]</a>: where all your equipment was there, somebody could get in, it could be serviced within an hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3000.097s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Again, this does not make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3002.182s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Staying in a place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3003.706s">[Robert Penta]</a>: staying in a place that does not give you access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3006.348s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you have to do a habit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3012.031s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, you're being ridiculous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3014.492s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You went to 5 High Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3015.613s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You didn't have to get another place at 5 High Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3018.094s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You didn't have to get another place at Canal Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3019.975s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You didn't have to get another place at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3022.016s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is the only one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3023.017s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is your fourth move.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3023.917s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And on the fourth move, you need another place to put your equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3028.04s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah, it really bothers me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3029.04s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why does that bother you, Councilor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3029.921s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It bothers me because it doesn't belong here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3031.222s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It belongs in the place that you're renting, that you're taking the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3034.004s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You took the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3034.865s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You took the money from the ratepayers of this community to have a public access channel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3046.893s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah, I remember it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3049.234s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3049.534s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The vote was four to three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3050.334s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3077.837s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3078.138s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He's just going to keep repeating the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3079.518s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I'm going to go to another question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3081.059s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Your station manager last week said he has a budget of $100,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3084.501s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a separate budget that's doing all that work down there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3087.243s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How much is that budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3088.624s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What is that costing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3090.545s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3091.665s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What does that cost?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3101.69s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3102.291s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He indicated that there's two separate budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3104.392s">[Robert Penta]</a>: One is an operating budget, one's a- Well, we have an operating budget and a capital budget, sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3108.776s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So what's paying for that, operating or capital?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3160.43s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Last question, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3161.951s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Last week, because your station manager couldn't answer the question, so maybe you can answer it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3166.034s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When's the last time you've been audited?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3168.518s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Did you give him an opportunity to answer the question last night?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3171.019s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes, I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3171.319s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He said he didn't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3173.56s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, not an audit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3175.981s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You filed your report to the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3177.621s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm talking about an audit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3196.356s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're the station manager.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3197.677s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have your money managers over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3199.799s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They should know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3203.222s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're the president?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3204.063s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I am the president of the corporation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3205.024s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And how long have you been there, Frank?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3206.665s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I've been affiliated with TV3 since 1986.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3208.608s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well then, from 1987 to this particular time, you should have a pretty good idea how a station runs and what they're responsible for and what to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3217.962s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I have a lot better idea than you and some other people in this room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3220.706s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just asked you the question then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3222.609s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The last time you think was three to four years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3225.092s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Three to four years ago, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3227.194s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not an answer in your world?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3239.927s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you didn't adhere to Judge Jackson's report and her findings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3243.1s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Apparently you didn't follow her recommendations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3259.068s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, that's a very interesting comment to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3261.049s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The city pays $15,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3277.139s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you're saying that city solicitor Rumley, he hurled car bombs at you too?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3282.002s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is that what you're saying?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3283.803s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3284.524s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah, no comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3285.224s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I guess so, huh?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3286.465s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3287.405s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor Caraviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3440.86s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What was that remark supposed to mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3443.561s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, it was just a little fun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3444.741s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3445.041s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What's that supposed to mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3446.081s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Lighten up, dear boy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3447.002s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, I'm not going to lighten up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3448.382s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm serious about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3449.862s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You think I'm going to go in there and take your equipment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3455.583s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What are you talking about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3456.443s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I didn't hurl any accusations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3457.243s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You would take offense to that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3458.144s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I didn't hurl any.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3458.644s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just made comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3459.564s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I didn't hurl anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3460.544s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I didn't point the finger at anyone that was doing anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3463.044s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I asked questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3463.945s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is that right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3464.465s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes, that's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3465.165s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is that right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3465.665s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3466.165s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, what about this missing money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3468.045s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You tell me about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3469.866s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's no money missing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3472.526s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, then, Senator Heath, read its report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3491.212s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Frank Leary was right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3492.192s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If that's the case, Frank, I would be more than happy to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3494.554s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But when your money managers say that you people keep sloppy bookkeeping records, I have to find out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3500.078s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3500.278s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Point of information, Vice President Del Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3705.333s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, with... Point of information, Councilor Penta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3709.876s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You guys get $200,000 a year from the subscribers of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3715.38s">[Robert Penta]</a>: $200,000 a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3715.96s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you're telling me you cannot afford to have an annual audit on your books?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3720.864s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's right, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3741.962s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they do more, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3742.922s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a matter of fact, they go before the legislative body almost quarterly to explain what they do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3748.767s">[Robert Penta]</a>: the programs that they're presenting, and they tell them about their income levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3769.151s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have, and he hasn't responded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3770.551s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's why we're discussing it right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3779.774s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He's not the only proper authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3781.294s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We represent the people of this community, and we represent cable TV subscribers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3786.237s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, if you folks want to come here and give your sales pitch, you go right ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3789.879s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They can hear you, and they can hear any one of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3813.746s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where am I getting my information?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3816.948s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Wait a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3817.889s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, you just made a comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3819.55s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes, I did, Mr. Penta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3820.43s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who am I getting and where am I getting my information from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3822.972s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't think I have the ability to do this on my own?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3824.633s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is that what you're trying to say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3826.57s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You think I'm somebody else's mouthpiece?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3833.863s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm not going to stand here and listen to that nonsense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3836.006s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3918.209s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All right, Councilor Panta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3919.07s">[Robert Penta]</a>: One last question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3920.13s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You may have won the award, but so didn't 10 other communities win the award, all right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3923.851s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you weren't the only community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3925.252s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We won the National Excellence Award.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4112.193s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On that motion, Councilor Penta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4114.574s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If I understand how the motion just did not pass, I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4119.757s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the question then becomes of the mayor, that the mayor should be reporting back to the council that he is allowing Channel 3, he should update this council, that he is now allowing Channel 3 to house and use this building for the purposes of supplementing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4212.754s">[Robert Penta]</a>: First Councilor Penta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4213.875s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, I'm thankful that Councilor Lingo-Curran now has added on to the resolution in thought and in practice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4221.44s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What we have here is a whole host of issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4224.005s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As we had our discussion tonight relative to the pool issue, the bottom line to all of this is the mayor says everything is a priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4231.849s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, everything cannot be a priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4233.75s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Taxpayers in this community are going to wind up paying for everything that's a priority in the mayor's mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4238.532s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have a police yard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4239.552s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have a fire department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4240.993s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have public works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4242.374s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have whatever the heck is going on on Commercial Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4245.235s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know how much longer that's going to last.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4249.237s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We still haven't even resolved the issue<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4251.573s">[Robert Penta]</a>: of the girls or the ladies or the women, however you want to use the terminology in the police department, you know, the locker rooms or the lack of locker rooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4259.505s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and the safety issues that need to be revolved over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4263.868s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We never even got to the point of the Water and Sewer Department after the fire in May of three years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4268.872s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They were supposed to get a trailer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4270.013s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They never even got a trailer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4272.334s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, these things go on and on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4274.336s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, we have a swimming pool that's now going to get us well up to almost $3,800,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4277.418s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It started off as a $2.3 million adventure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4279.119s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I just don't think the taxpayers of this city<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4286.238s">[Robert Penta]</a>: should be led to believe, oh, we can afford it, we can afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4289.079s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What can we afford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4289.9s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Every time you slap a dollar on the price tag of all of this stuff, somebody has to pay for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4295.943s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, there's no conversation anymore about the no-interest loans that the MWRA had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4300.625s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know whatever happened to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4301.966s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We never heard anything more about, you know, the money that was supposed to be coming forward from the billboards and all of that to appropriate this money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4309.73s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So, I really think, Mr. President, before any votes take place,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4315.07s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Any agreements take place on any one of these issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4317.973s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We really need to, if the mayor doesn't want to put it in some kind of an order of priority, then maybe the council should, between and amongst ourselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4325.899s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe we all feel that the public works department is more important than the pool, or maybe the police department is more important than the pool, or the pool is more important than the fire department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4334.727s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4335.467s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But there's only so much money that we have to go out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4337.91s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you have a budget coming up right around the corner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4340.231s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as Councilor Lungelkorn alluded to before,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4342.515s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as Councilor Marks also alluded to, we should have these figures before this budget even comes into place so we have some kind of an idea how much this is gonna cost and where we're going with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4356.882s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You talk to the rate payer, the taxpayer on the street, all they know is the cost of everything just keeps going up and up and up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4363.726s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the cost of government keeps going up too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4366.327s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think we saw a pure example of it tonight<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4368.686s">[Robert Penta]</a>: on Channel 3 coming down here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4370.167s">[Robert Penta]</a>: To me, it's total incompetence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4371.928s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They did not want to address or discuss the issue regarding ratepayers' money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4376.111s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At least we can discuss taxpayers' money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4379.073s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at least we have some semblance of controlling of what's going on in this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4383.597s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Unfortunately, on the cable TV subscribers, why the mayor is refusing to get involved to do anything, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4390.882s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe they have a tie over him over something, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4393.624s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But it's absolutely wrong as to what's going on over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4396.286s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But more importantly, at least on this particular issue,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4398.683s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have some control over it, and we have the control of either saying yes, no, or maybe, or cut it in between, and maybe it's not as grandiose as it appears to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4407.668s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4408.548s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor Longo-Kurin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4891.449s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At the meeting tonight, there were two papers that were handled of updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4894.93s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think you got one of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4897.071s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Oh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4897.391s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4897.751s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think all the council should get copies of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4909.658s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there was another two-page one that they had given out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7773.444s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Joseph Pierre.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7779.729s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is that your brother?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7780.87s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Joseph O. No, he's Joseph O. Joseph O. Pierre.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7784.573s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I get a page here from the Sailor of Weights and Measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7787.535s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's unsigned and undated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7790.217s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As a matter of fact, both of his pages are unsigned and undated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7798.664s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Clark, they're unsigned and undated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7831.107s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're using Friday Canal Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7833.248s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What's Harvard Street?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7839.513s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What's your company?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7850.86s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have two different names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7857.179s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have two different corporations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7865.245s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All County Transportation, Inc.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7872.09s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have one cab already right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7874.232s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What's the name of that cab company?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7884.711s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't understand this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7885.532s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you want three cabs, why do you have two different cab company names?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7909.553s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How could you be paying $600 a month if you didn't get the license?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7915.807s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The insurance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7916.507s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7917.348s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Insurance for what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7921.79s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You paid $7,200 a year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7923.23s">[Robert Penta]</a>: $7,200 a year, that's what you pay for insurance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7926.112s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you don't have a cab license.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7927.632s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How could you be paying that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7971.937s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You are self-insured $10,000 for each car.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7974.438s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what you're saying?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7975.698s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes, most of the cabins are self-insured.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7977.819s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You put $20,000 up to insure two cars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7982.541s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You just got through saying you're paying $600 a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7984.202s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7984.322s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Current insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8034.442s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is your other taxi self-insured too?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8100.859s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't possibly can believe that you need two more cabs to operate in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8108.503s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You already have one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8109.223s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's 44 cabs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8111.504s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just cannot believe there is no<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8115.354s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's no business out there for 44 cabs in this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8119.617s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just don't understand this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8125.701s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8129.844s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know if you're from a court or what, but I can't support it because I just think this is completely out of control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8135.023s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All of it's out of control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8136.524s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't even have your own certificate of insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8138.845s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You write self-insured.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8140.246s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The Commonwealth of Massachusetts tells you you have to have a stamped self-insured certificate when you're using the term self-insured.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8247.443s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That Mr. Ramirez be invited down, who was a wonderful asset,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8250.635s">[Robert Penta]</a>: at the Brookline Bank and he just retired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8253.516s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it'd be nice to have the people take a look and see and have him give us his resume.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8296.098s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Two papers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8296.598s">[Robert Penta]</a>: 13-449.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8298.786s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was laid in the table on the 14th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8301.868s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Um, DPW parks department and Hormel commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8305.79s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We get a report back on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8309.151s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, but he laid it for one week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8314.134s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8361.026s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why can't it be open all the time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8362.147s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8367.41s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why can't they be open, like, on Saturday and Sunday when they go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8369.391s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It should be.<br><br>
