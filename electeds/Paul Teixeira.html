 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2618.393s">Hi,</a> good evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2619.436s">Dr.</a> Cushy. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2627.992s">The</a> EL Summer Enrichment Program, we have various programs that happen starting in the end of June. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2633.875s">It</a> starts with a one-week STEM camp at Hanscom Air Force Base through STAR Labs, which is a week-long STEM camp for students in fifth and sixth grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2645.521s">They</a> do robotics, engineering, computer design. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2649.723s">They</a> build rockets. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2651.044s">They</a> get to launch them. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2652.504s">It's</a> kind of fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2654.365s">and</a> after that ends then we roll into our summer enrichment program which it's basically uh k through eight uh k through five is at the missatuck our numbers actually doubled this year we typically have about 45 students in the program during the summer and this year we had almost 100. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2676.325s">Then</a> at the middle school, which we host up at the high school, we run a middle school summer enrichment program. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2681.647s">And</a> then we do an add-on program for credit recovery for high school students to get what they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2688.79s">So</a> if they failed a class, it's a combination of enrichment and credit recovery. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2697.188s">And</a> then we also offer tutoring at the Medford Public Library, and that's for our secondary students. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2704.413s">Teachers</a> will do office hours, just one hour, and it fluctuates based on availability. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2710.637s">It's</a> mornings and evenings. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2713.358s">And</a> students who need help with getting their summer reading done, picking out books, any other math or history packets at the secondary level, there's a teacher there to kind of guide them through that through the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2727.33s">And</a> those, Dr. Cushing, if you want, I just have pictures of what we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2731.733s">Also</a> at the elementary program, we contracted with High Touch High Tech, which is a science organization that's in Massachusetts and Maine, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2744.882s">And</a> they come and we get to pick what they're going to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2748.464s">I</a> think last year was bridges, beams, and columns. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2751.626s">This</a> year they did electricity. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2754.067s">They</a> learned how to build circuits. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2756.369s">And</a> so the scientists come and they rotate through the grades throughout the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2763.273s">Dr.</a> Cushing? <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2765.543s">And</a> then with the elementary program, because this is enrichment and it's paid for out of Title III, we try to plan a field trip every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2773.349s">Because</a> of our increased numbers, we actually had to separate out. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2776.671s">So</a> all of the students got to go to the Franklin Park Zoo. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2780.834s">But</a> the Children's Museum and the Aquarium, we divided it K-2 and 3-5 to offset the numbers because Title III will pay the admission, the transportation costs, everything for the students for the enrichment program. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2796.926s">Dr.</a> Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2798.567s">These</a> are just various photos of the field trips that the students went on. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2802.808s">And</a> the summer curriculum is tied into what the students are learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2806.27s">So,</a> you know, there's an animal component, there's sea life, there's, you know, general academics that also happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2813.613s">And</a> then these are photos from Starbase. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2816.894s">This</a> was actually building bridges. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2821.836s">And</a> this was CAD design for programming the robots too. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2828.68s">And</a> then again, as Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2830.381s">Bowen</a> said, this wouldn't have happened without the support of the teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2833.883s">This</a> is the list of all of the teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2837.025s">I</a> was also fully staffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2838.385s">I</a> was very lucky because of the increased numbers that I managed to get some additional staff to support the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2844.349s">And</a> then also a special thanks to Anthony Petralis because <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2848.351s">what</a> we do is our program ends at noon but what we've done with him is arranged that we have 30 slots for the after-school program that they can go into summer fun i provide the teachers as an add-on so students can stay and get the full day in if they choose
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2880.592s">So</a> we took a list. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2882.292s">So</a> we send out a separate permission slip after students show up and register, and we keep a separate list. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2887.853s">So</a> as students, not every student that signed up could go on to Summer Fun because we only have the 30 slots. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2893.755s">We</a> can't overwhelm the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2895.715s">but</a> anyone that signed up for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2897.715s">So</a> if a student was absent, we could rotate through, we would call and say, oh, you know, child can stay today. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2904.257s">So</a> almost everybody got, you know, that wanted to got to experience it at some point.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2921.96s">I</a> wish I had an answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2922.94s">It</a> was a surprise when the registration started coming in and we were counting up the numbers and making the class lists. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2929.663s">I</a> just, I don't have a reason.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2935.405s">Like</a> I said, it gave me it because of the registration and we'll accept registrations the day of, because again, it's enrichment. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2943.368s">Again,</a> it allowed us to give us a little lag time because we had that week off to recruit two more teachers for the program.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2953.336s">Yes,</a> it all comes out of the Title III grant.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2985.683s">So</a> like I said, they were building bridges, so I don't know if that's what that program would be for, but then the other program in the other picture was coding so they could actually program their robots to follow a track, and then the robots fight the little robot wars. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3003.534s">That's</a> amazing.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3007.597s">It</a> was a little more than just one week.<h2><a href="../2024-05-29_njO2v-AZ2UM/2024-05-29_njO2v-AZ2UM.html">SubCommittee Meeting - Curriculum</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=323.364s">Um,</a> sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=323.984s">Hi,</a> I'm Baltic Sarah. <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=325.064s">I'm</a> the director of the English learner education program for the Medford public schools.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=381.657s">Yes,</a> we can see you.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1998.779s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1999.58s">So</a> we use the map data a little bit differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2002.661s">We'll</a> have all of our students, whether they're newcomers or Yale pullout students, they take the math map test because that's informing us, obviously, <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2013.462s">Fifth</a> grade looks different in Brazil than it does in China, than it does in Haiti, than it does in the US. <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2019.988s">So</a> because it is based on the standards, we can target what our students are missing, not due to lack of instruction here, but what they didn't get in their countries prior to coming in, because we place them by grade level. <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2033.879s">So</a> if they're in seventh grade and they missed fifth grade skills, we can hone in on that using the map data. <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2042.659s">And</a> then for the ELA map, only our pull-out students who are level 3-4 EL or higher will take the map ELA test. <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2053.902s">And</a> we use that data to make our placement decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2057.563s">If</a> they're ready to exit from the EL program, it's another piece of data in addition to the access test, if we can place them in mainstream classrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2067.341s">And</a> then we also just, we use the science in a similar way. <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2071.946s">MCAS</a> is just fifth and eighth grade there, but it helps us kind of hone in on what skills that they may be missing because of cultural differences with educational systems in different countries.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2103.672s">Yeah,</a> so we do have a separate ELD curriculum, English Language Development curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2109.495s">And</a> I'm not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2110.776s">I</a> have a different list that I added, and I may have missed this, Suzanne. <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2116.159s">As</a> you were going through it, I didn't add my stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2118.624s">So</a> we have English language development curriculum based on students' grade level and their English language proficiency level. <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2125.249s">And</a> so currently right now what's happening in the elementary, because we now have a new program into reading, the HMH program, our EL curriculum hasn't changed, but we're updating the curriculum to support the new materials being used to deliver that curriculum.<h2><a href="../2024-05-07_b7dJktkvvbU/2024-05-07_b7dJktkvvbU.html">5.6.2024 Regular School Committee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=203.798s">Good</a> evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=204.879s">Good</a> evening, everyone.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=230.484s">I</a> will be fast. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=235.667s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=236.828s">So</a> you guys got a pretty thick packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=238.909s">We're</a> not gonna go over the whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=240.47s">I</a> sent you the ELE requirements because even though it just says like parent notification, there's like three pages of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=249.216s">So</a> I just wanted you to understand what the requirements are. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=253.078s">on</a> everything that this review does. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=257.139s">So</a> it occurs every six year with a three-year check-in. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=260.7s">And</a> for the past year, I've been working on this with DESE, uploading, they wanna know our procedures, they wanna see samples of all of the documentation that we send home to caregivers, our report cards, our progress reports, and then they pull individual student records. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=279.468s">And</a> they look at, you know, they want to make sure if it's a student who's bilingual who has an IEP that there was an interpreter at their meeting and they, you know, want verification for the sign in sheets and all of this gets uploaded to Desi's portal. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=292.352s">It</a> was probably about 1000 pages of paperwork that they got in preparation for this review. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=298.234s">They</a> do that every six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=299.736s">They</a> came to the district, they interviewed caregivers, students, teachers, administrators, and then they did walkthroughs through the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=309.791s">So</a> that's what the tiered focus monitoring is for the EL department. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=317.105s">So</a> this is the criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=318.586s">There</a> are 12 different areas that they look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=321.467s">Like</a> I said, each area has subgroups and pretty involved compliance at the federal level and also at the state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=332.112s">And</a> this is the legal requirement and the implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=334.893s">This</a> was a sample just to show you what they look for for one criterion. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=340.794s">So</a> upon their review, they give a rating system for each criterion, and then if it's implemented, the requirement's substantially met in all important aspects. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=350.837s">If</a> it's partially implemented, the requirement in one or several of those aspects, like the subgroups, may not be met, and then not implemented is the requirement is substantially not met. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=362.259s">So</a> we met or exceeded the state and federal implementation requirements in 10 out of 12 focus areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=372.096s">we</a> received partially implemented in two out of the 12 focus areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=376.338s">So</a> the two areas we had were ELE program placement and structure, which again, that's like three pages of requirements, and ELE 14, which is the licensure requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=389.142s">The</a> program and placement structure was a result of being under 50% for students making progress on the access test. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=397.805s">we</a> are at 38%. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=400.827s">But</a> I did pull the state data and surrounding districts just to show you we're all in the same boat. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=407.993s">We</a> just happen to have a curriculum, I mean, a coordinated program review or a tiered focus monitoring this year, but we are at 38%. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=416.319s">Now,</a> I realize we don't wanna be in line with the state, we wanna be higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=421.042s">So</a> we do have to do corrective action on how we're going to adjust that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=425.944s">And</a> so we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=429.545s">So</a> this is a report that came out in November 23 about the rising numbers of unmet needs with immigrant newcomer students in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=439.248s">So</a> again, this isn't a Medford issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=441.229s">It</a> is a statewide issue, but we are taking steps to help course correct with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=450.768s">So</a> this is the action plan to get us out of corrective action for ELE 5, and I'm not going to go over it because you have it all in your packets. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=460.599s">This</a> was submitted to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, and they approved this plan as a feasible plan to make the adjustments that we need to. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=471.331s">There</a> are a lot of things happening in the district that I do believe will contribute to increased scores. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=477.857s">Everything</a> from our new curriculum for early literacy, the science of reading that's happening in the schools, because our EL students are integrated in all of those classes, that will be a factor. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=491.668s">in</a> achievement and growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=493.789s">And</a> then we have the MAP growth, we have DIBLS testing, so we can do our formative assessments and check-ins throughout the year and adjust accordingly. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=503.574s">ELE</a> 14 was on licensure requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=506.475s">This</a> wasn't licensure for EL, this was a concern with Gen Ed classroom teachers not having the SEI endorsement. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=517.788s">So</a> this is a relatively easy fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=521.369s">Because</a> our numbers have grown dramatically in the last few years, there were many teachers who couldn't take the SEI class because they had to have EL students in their classroom in order to take that class. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=534.256s">That</a> was one of the requirements when DESE was offering that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=538.365s">And</a> so if they never had an EL student in their class, they were never flagged with DESE as needing the endorsement. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=546.051s">But</a> as our numbers have grown and our EL students are in more and more classrooms, that's what triggered this. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=552.916s">And</a> we think we have about 18 teachers who need the endorsement. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=559.22s">We're</a> working with principals to get an exact list. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=563.263s">And</a> then in the fall, <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=564.844s">We</a> will work with the teachers to help them get the endorsement that they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=568.646s">And</a> so by January of 2025, we should be all set. <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=573.808s">Any</a> questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=578.65s">Have</a> a great night.<h2><a

 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7576.786s">Good</a> evening, everyone, and welcome to our new members. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7583.272s">Tonight's</a> presentation is an overview of the EL program to kind of help the new members understand what's happening in Medford with our English learners. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7599.38s">The</a> program that we have is a sheltered English immersion program. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7602.363s">And</a> that's a two component program where we ensure that students get access to grade level content curriculum, as well as English as a second language instruction to support English language development among our learners. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7618.359s">We</a> have programs in every elementary school. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7623.023s">We</a> have newcomer programs for students who are at the foundational level of English language acquisition at the McGlynn and at the Missituk in grades one through five. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7635.072s">And</a> then we have EL pullout in every elementary school for students who are at the transitional level, which is three through five. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7644.522s">And</a> then at the middle school, we have a program at the McGlynn Middle School, which encompasses newcomers as well as ESL. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7652.065s">And</a> then at the high school, we have a newcomer program and ESL program. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7657.927s">And</a> we offer, we have a dedicated teacher on the vocational side of the house to support newcomer students as well as transitional students with the CTE programs that we offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7673.459s">How</a> these decisions are made is based on when students register, they fill out a home language survey form, which is a federal form that everyone's required to complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7687.504s">When</a> we complete the registration, we test the students for their English language proficiency. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7694.187s">It's</a> a test that include all four domains. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7696.548s">So</a> it's four separate tests and listening, reading, writing, and speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7700.575s">We</a> administer the test, we get a level, we create a schedule and determine which program the students will go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7707.36s">Once</a> the students have been in the program for a year, they take something called ACCESS. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7712.884s">That</a> is a state mandated test similar to MCAS, but it's specifically for English learner students. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7720.225s">Again,</a> it measures the four domains of language. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7723.407s">And</a> based on this, they take the test in January, we get the results the end of May, and then we make our placement decisions in June for the following September. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7732.854s">This</a> is only one piece of data that we use to make our placement determinations. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7737.097s">We</a> use a lot of district determined measures, such as map scores, we do writing prompts that are used, that are scored using the WIDA writing rubric, which is what the ELD curriculum is based upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7752.105s">So</a> enrollment numbers, I have the history going back to 2015-16, and I'm keeping it in there because eventually we're going to hit 700 students, and I want to know how many years it took us to double our numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7767.025s">So</a> at this moment, and this says 631, but today we just had 632 join Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7774.887s">So</a> we have 632 English learner students. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7777.928s">That</a> number is in real time. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7780.049s">At</a> the end of the year, when DESE runs their report, the number will go down because if you see 22, 23, that was at 528, but we actually at one point had 580 students last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7794.363s">DESE</a> counts a student as an English learner in the previous year if they are recorded in our SIMS data, our student information management system, for two cycles. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7806.065s">So</a> when we do our October report and our March report, then the student counts. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7811.586s">If</a> the March report and the June report, the number counts. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7816.968s">But</a> any students that leave us in the interim, even though they may have been with us for three months, don't count in those numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7825.435s">So</a> if you look at the bottom, we have how many students were tested. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7830.358s">So,</a> which one?
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7839.284s">This</a> year, just since the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7841.946s">We've</a> tested 391 new students. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7845.632s">in</a> the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7846.432s">Of</a> those 391, 259 qualified for EL services. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7853.215s">But</a> then we've also had 134 students withdraw from the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7858.398s">We</a> have a very fluid population of English learners. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7861.659s">We</a> have students who will come here because they may have existing family. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7866.021s">They</a> get started here in Medford, then they find their own housing, they move out. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7870.103s">We</a> have students that go back to their home country. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7873.384s">We</a> have students that just leave the district to, unfortunately, many high school students, they go into the workforce to support and help their families. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7884.648s">So</a> we've had 134 withdrawals this year, but basically 765 students have passed through our doors to date for English learners. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7896.909s">So</a> with that, we have university partnerships. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7900.67s">So</a> we have a partnership with Lesley University. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7903.411s">They</a> have an elementary education program with an add-on Yale license. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7908.112s">And</a> what that means is while they're completing their coursework, they do a year-long internship in one of our newcomer classrooms in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7916.474s">So</a> we get, <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7918.955s">a</a> teacher candidate from August through June. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7924.279s">And</a> the great piece of this is that essentially we get to train the teacher, and when we have openings, we can hire them. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7933.105s">They're</a> certified in both areas, and they're familiar with the district, they're familiar with our protocols. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7940.267s">The</a> other university partnership we have is the UMass program. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7944.912s">Last</a> year, I presented to you that we were part of a grant opportunity with the US Department of Education to have 15 seats for a free half masters in applied linguistics. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7961.167s">and</a> that gets teachers an ESL certification. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7965.388s">So</a> it's for existing teachers in the district to kind of broaden their teaching acumen so that they can put forth all of the teaching strategies beyond retail into their classrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7978.972s">So</a> this program ends in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7982.493s">We</a> had 13 people successfully complete the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7986.815s">and</a> they'll be duly certified in their content area as well as ESL if they pass the MTEL. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7997.065s">So</a> we have a District English Learner Advisory Council that is similar to Special Education CPAC. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8006.492s">I</a> call this, many districts will call it an LPAC, English Language Parent Advisory Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8013.556s">I</a> like to take the word parent out of it because many of our students are here without their parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8018.48s">And</a> so this is the equivalent. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8020.501s">It's</a> the District English Learner Advisory Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8023.496s">We</a> have monthly meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8024.936s">Eventually</a> what should happen with this group is that the caregivers will eventually take it over. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8031.238s">It's</a> challenging because they all don't speak the same language. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8035.059s">And</a> so we utilize high school students who are bilingual to come to these meetings, to serve as interpreters, kind of bridge the gap between the different languages in the group. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8047.422s">We</a> have people who have signed up to be leaders. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8051.683s">And</a> they haven't started scheduling and running their own meetings, but it's a work in progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8063.769s">And</a> with that, we've also contracted some seminars for caregivers through the Massachusetts Partnership for Youth. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8073.573s">And</a> in March, the presentation was on a healthy balance screen time. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8078.914s">This</a> was to support our caregivers with establishing boundaries with devices in their home, how they can support the school, how they can use them as learning tools and some internet safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8093.132s">and</a> next month's presentation is going to be on vaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8099.335s">Then</a> we've also partnered with the Welcome Project in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8103.177s">The</a> Welcome Project helps provide... <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8106.857s">caregivers</a> with English classes for free. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8110.339s">They</a> got a grant a year and a half ago to expand outside of Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8114.462s">I</a> was working in partnership with Sarah Londgren from the Welcome Project and we ended up creating classes here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8122.348s">We</a> hold them at the Medford Public Library. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8125.11s">This</a> way here, families don't have to come into the schools, get quarry checked for the classes or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8131.254s">They</a> have a beautiful new space in the library that they've been using. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8135.66s">We've</a> run three in-person classes, and then those are on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and then we have virtual classes in the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8143.604s">So</a> the funding for this grant that the Welcome Project got is ending this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8148.066s">This</a> will be the last class, but we're going to continue with the classes in the fall, and we'll use a federal grant, Title III, to continue these for our caregivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8159.911s">And</a> then Tech Goes Home is another partnership we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8163.7s">This</a> is an organization in Boston that allows us to teach digital literacy to our caregivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8172.126s">We've</a> trained Medford teachers who will work in the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8176.41s">We've</a> created a curriculum for the caregivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8180.193s">It's</a> everything from how to navigate the Medford Public Schools website, how to check for school lunches, how to communicate with your child's teacher, how to send an email, how to find English classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8191.842s">It's</a> a 15 hour course. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8194.564s">And</a> I actually just found out two hours before this meeting, our course was approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8198.688s">So</a> we'll be running another one. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8200.09s">It</a> begins August 8th and it will end in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8204.334s">And</a> at the completion of this, the caregivers get a free Chromebook, a free year of internet access, headphones, carrying case. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8217.594s">In</a> other news, the Yale department just completed its tiered focused monitoring. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8222.18s">This</a> is similar to what special education just had to go through with the Department of Ed. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8228.027s">Every</a> three to six year, every three years on a three year cycle, Desi comes in and does a complete audit of the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8236.678s">There</a> are 12 criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8238.98s">11</a> seems to be cut off. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8240.601s">I</a> mean, number 12 seems to be cut off on my computer. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8243.704s">But</a> these are the criteria that they measure the efficacy of the EL program with. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8252.011s">So</a> for the past year, I've had to upload hundreds of pages of documentation for each of these criteria and then <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8261.679s">criteria.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8262.72s">And</a> then they came into the district in February, and they did classroom walkthroughs at the McGlynn, the Missittuck, the McGlynn Middle, and then also the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8275.226s">They</a> interviewed caregivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8277.787s">They</a> interviewed teachers, general education teachers, EL teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8281.729s">They</a> interviewed students and administrators. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8286.391s">They'll</a> be putting together a final report. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8288.716s">We</a> should have it in the next few weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8290.339s">I'm</a> sure I'll be back here to explain the findings in their report to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8297.864s">And</a> then the new literacy program at the elementary level into reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8302.408s">These</a> are the new materials that were purchased that the teachers have received extensive PD on the EL teachers are included in this, whether they're a newcomer teacher or pull out teacher, even though we have our own English language development curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8318.38s">What</a> the EL teachers are doing is they're modifying the curriculum to support components from the inter-reading program so that the goal is that students leave newcomers, will go into a mainstream classroom, and while they're in the mainstream classroom, they'll still get EL support, but all of the inter-reading, all of the strategies for early literacy will be the same, so it's not, <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8344.261s">a</a> culture shock when they change levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8347.344s">So</a> there's a team of teachers putting together the curriculum, taking the old curriculum and aligning it with the new materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8358.752s">And</a> then talking points is you'll hear people talk about this all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8363.994s">This</a> is a two-way communication platform that the district purchased. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8369.416s">It</a> pulls information from our student information system to allow teachers, administrators, district administrators to engage in two-way communication with our families. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8381.221s">This</a> isn't just for English learner families. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8383.882s">It's</a> basically a text message system. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8386.803s">And</a> if in our home language or in the home language is identified as something other than English, the app automatically translates the message. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8396.507s">So</a> if it goes, you know, if Portuguese was selected. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8399.861s">Teacher</a> sends a classroom message home. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8401.862s">It</a> gets translated into Portuguese just for that family. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8406.185s">The</a> family responds in Portuguese. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8408.307s">It</a> translates it back to English for the teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8411.269s">So</a> teachers have been using this now for a little over a year with the district subscription that we purchased. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8416.953s">And</a> I just pulled last week's data to show you like almost 1,700 messages were sent home in a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8426.761s">Another</a> translation device that we purchased for teachers and for school staff who interact with multilingual families is something called Pocket Talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8437.59s">It's</a> an oral translation device. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8440.172s">So</a> you hold the button, you choose your target language, you speak, it interprets it, flip it, the other person speaks their language, it transfers it, translates it back into English. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8453.547s">These</a> were given to all building principals, all building secretaries, nurses, anyone that comes into contact with caregivers where they may need on-the-spot instant translation. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8467.834s">And</a> this isn't going to take the place of talking points. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8470.056s">It's</a> not going to take the place of hiring interpreters for in-person meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8474.278s">This</a> is just the on-the-fly, you need an interpreter. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8479.744s">We</a> ended up purchasing 45 in the district and then Chad Fallon bought 15 for the CTE teachers because they'll have newcomer students going through the CTE rotations. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8490.688s">And</a> sometimes it's really helpful for those teachers to be able to translate, especially where, you know, safety concerns in the shops right there on the fly. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8499.991s">And</a> then all of the newcomer teachers have them as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8505.714s">And</a> then for professional development, the EL department offers professional development outside of the typical professional development days. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8513.899s">All</a> content teachers need to earn 15 hours of professional development in SEI or ESL strategies. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8522.665s">So</a> these are on optional PD days. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8525.527s">These</a> are in the evenings. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8527.749s">So</a> teachers, it helps them recertify, but these topics were based on what teachers have asked for and what we've seen in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8540.555s">And</a> then coming up, we have summer enrichment planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8543.656s">We</a> offer summer enrichment for elementary, middle, and high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8550.458s">This</a> slide has changed from what I gave you, because I realized I missed some stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8554.479s">So</a> I'll give the new one to Lisa for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8558.48s">We</a> run an elementary summer program, K-5 at the Missittauk. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8562.501s">And</a> then I've partnered with Anthony Petrelis with Summer Fun, and I will fund teachers to work in the afternoon program, so they can take Yale students who want to stay longer for the day, and it's at no cost to the families. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8579.345s">We</a> have a program for students in grades five and six. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8584.089s">It's</a> called Starbase. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8585.29s">It's</a> at Hanscom Air Force Base. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8587.032s">It's</a> a STEM lab. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8588.033s">It's</a> a week-long STEM lab. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8590.215s">Students</a> get to use 3D printers. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8594.078s">They</a> have robotic wars with cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8598.382s">They</a> do the derby cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8600.063s">They</a> launch rockets. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8601.805s">They</a> do chemistry experiments. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8604.428s">That's</a> offered through Starbase, and we've been doing that now for, I think, six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8613.131s">And</a> then we have middle school summer enrichment at Medford High School, and then we do credit recovery for students in grades nine through 12, nine through 11, and then in grades six through 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8623.299s">We</a> offer summer reading support. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8626.342s">I</a> can use Title III funds to pay teachers to do office hours at the Medford Public Library. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8631.546s">So</a> any middle school and high school students that need help with their summer reading, choosing a book, any of their math packets or history packets that they get, there's somebody there <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8642.515s">two</a> times a week, mornings and late afternoons to get that support. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8650.483s">And</a> then this leads me to my last slide, which is an ask for the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8656.71s">As</a> our numbers are increasing, we have a large influx of students in kindergarten this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8663.795s">And</a> I never have a crystal ball, I can never tell exactly how many students we're going to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8668.885s">So</a> I have to base it on trends from the previous year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8674.361s">And</a> so, Basing, we had, I think, 38 newcomer students last year in kindergarten, and we currently have 32 students in first grade newcomer classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8686.827s">Now,</a> that's not all from that class, that's students who have come in through the year, but that's how I gauge what my numbers are going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8694.41s">This</a> year, we have 20 more newcomer students than we did last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8698.47s">And</a> so we are going to need another first grade classroom for newcomer students, and preferably at the McGlynn, because that is where the bulk of the students are. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8710.537s">I</a> won't know the exact number until the end of May, beginning of June, because with the kindergarten students, they take that access test in January, and there is so much growth in a kindergarten student from January to June, that it's not an accurate measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8728.087s">we</a> take the two options. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8730.671s">If</a> the teachers say this student is ready to be reclassified as a former English learner student, we give them a test called the WAPT. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8739.782s">Again,</a> it measures all four domains, reading, writing, listening, and speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8744.727s">And</a> that will give us the determination if they have the cut score to just go into a general education classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8750.349s">If</a> they were a newcomer student and the teacher is recommending that they go into first grade newcomers, they also give that WAPT test. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8757.672s">That</a> will give me the data I need to know that, yes, they have to remain in newcomers. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8763.254s">And</a> so that won't happen until the beginning of June. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8766.115s">But</a> based on previous trends, this is what I'm predicting.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8772.558s">Any</a> questions?
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8899.02s">Well,</a> and that happens with the CTE exploratory programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8904.321s">All</a> of the new students go through the same rotations, and they're not a cohort. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8910.122s">It's</a> six in this group, five in this group, so they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8913.983s">the</a> students are integrated with everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8915.945s">And</a> those rotations include all the CTE exploratory programs as well as the arts.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8954.625s">So</a> we have been increasing staff throughout the years, and that is something, especially the elementary strand of newcomers at the McGlynn, which is where the biggest numbers are. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8968.374s">The</a> way the program is structured is it's sustainable to continue to add new students, but that's why I brought up the first grade class, because I know that's not sustainable, because they can't have two first grade newcomer classrooms with 25 students in them each.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9066.044s">It</a> is, but what happens is with any other new students who are non-Yale that go to the Andrews or that come into middle school, if they don't need Yale programming, they go to the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9076.389s">So</a> the numbers are actually, and I'd have to look up what the exact numbers are, but the numbers between the two buildings are similar. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9083.232s">It's</a> equitable. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9083.733s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9104.908s">And</a> the last thing that I want to say on the last slide is that none of this work could happen without the EL teachers, because every committee I mentioned, every DELAC, there are people that I have EL teachers who work on all of those programs that I just described. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9120.881s">The</a> Tech Goes Home, the summer programs, none of this work could happen without those teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9128.027s">So</a> thank you to them.<h2><a href="../2023-09-19_B_or_Ix1ooU/2023-09-19_B_or_Ix1ooU.html">9.18.2023 Medford School Committee Regular Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=6878.083s">Hi,</a> good evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=6880.704s">Can</a> you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=6882.685s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=6884.705s">So</a> as part of DESE's coordinated program review, which is happening at the same time with special education, they will do a complete review of the EL programs and services in this school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=6899.11s">The</a> recommendation that was posted in the AIR report <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=6904.079s">was</a> about the fact that we have two middle schools right next to each other and only one has an EL program. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=6911.426s">And</a> I just wanna point out that that's equal services, it's not equity. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=6916.33s">I'm</a> not quite sure how it was interpreted that it wasn't equitable because if equity is giving every student what they need, the EL students at the McGlynn are getting what they need in terms of services. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=6931.135s">That</a> model and program was reviewed by DESE when we made the changes four years ago, and it was heralded as could be a model for the rest of the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=6944.245s">But</a> they'll re-examine it this year as part of the coordinated program review. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=6950.649s">And</a> we'll continue to do professional development for teachers with SEI strategies. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=6955.893s">Every</a> year we offer a 15 PDP course. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=6959.525s">so</a> teachers can recertify for their licensure renewal. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=6964.407s">They</a> have to get 15 PDPs in special education and SEI. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=6967.748s">And</a> every year we've offered a 15 hour course in SEI.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=6976.911s">SEI</a> is sheltered English instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=6981.613s">So</a> anything, any classroom that has an English learner student in it is considered an SEI classroom, sheltered English instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=6989.962s">all</a> teachers are responsible for meeting the needs of the English learners in their classroom, regardless of the grade level or the content. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=6999.61s">And</a> then last, we wanna conduct a review to determine if creating a lower and upper middle school, lower middle school being grades five, six, and upper middle school, seven, eight, that will address the capacity issues that the teachers brought up in the, <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=7016.351s">in</a> the report that said about the equity, you know, having the program only in one middle school, but not the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=7021.555s">And</a> I did run some numbers if anyone's interested, but our numbers have remained consistent at the McGlynn Middle School for EL students in both newcomer classrooms and ESL services per pullout.<h2><a href="../2022-11-07_1f4Nwqi6Ka4/2022-11-07_1f4Nwqi6Ka4.html">11.7.2022 Medford School Committee Regular Meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=3756.141s">I</a> don't, you know, and so that is an interesting question because there are other cohorts that will be, that will begin like in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=3763.923s">And,</a> you know, I'll stay in touch if we can't, you know, if they don't, if other districts aren't filling them, you know, to see if we can jump in on that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=3772.285s">So</a> this happened because I was looking for interns to come do their student teaching in Medford and, <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=3783.007s">through</a> meeting the director and going through that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=3784.849s">And</a> I brought her down to the McGlynn Middle School to show her the program and program design. <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=3790.514s">And</a> that's when she started talking about this opportunity that they were applying for. <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=3796.419s">And</a> I don't know what like years two, three, and four looked like for them, but Medford would definitely be a part of that.

 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=8456.533s">Hi,</a> good evening everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=8458.415s">We</a> ran summer enrichment programs for our English learner students, we had an elementary program for students in K through five that was held at the mistletoe. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=8468.224s">We</a> brought back the star base program if you remember that from a couple years ago this is the first year we've done the. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=8477.059s">But</a> on on site in person hands on stem lab for the week and then we offered tutoring for students at the Medford public library in the middle school and then at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=8490.126s">We</a> support the credit recovery so y'all students can make up the content classes that they need in order to gain the credits to move on to the next grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=8500.267s">So</a> these are just some photos at the Missittuck, the elementary program. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=8503.969s">They</a> were doing some bug exploration. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=8506.39s">We</a> try to infuse content into what the students are learning as they're developing their language skills. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=8512.694s">And</a> we focus on the four areas, reading, writing, listening, and speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=8518.537s">And</a> then obviously some enrichment play time as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=8523.24s">And</a> then this was the STARBASE program this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=8525.642s">This</a> is the week-long STEM camp at Hanscom Air Force Base. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=8530.565s">We</a> had 15 students attend that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=8534.408s">It's</a> just a one-week program, full day, and it's a full hands-on STEM lab. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=8541.593s">They</a> were building a bridge here that's Leonardo da Vinci Bridge in Italy. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=8547.867s">and</a> they learn to recreate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=8549.95s">So</a> there's physics, they learn chemistry, they do some coding, 3D printing, some robotics. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=8559.024s">Move</a> on to the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=8561.301s">And</a> it's just hands-on, fully engaged learning activities for the week. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=8567.463s">This</a> year, STARBASE partnered with Bridgewater State University and they had student interns also working with our students, in addition to the scientists from STARBASE and the two teachers from Medford who accompanied our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=8584.901s">Um,</a> so obviously this program or any of these programs can't, um, go on without any of the teachers who gave up part of their summer work. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=8592.849s">And</a> I just want to recognize may I put this on Alexander and Alexa and Nunziata, Alison Blanchard, uh, Adelaine Cahill, who also worked as the lead teacher for the elementary program for me, Abby Harris, Melissa Calendarian, Julia Mitchell, and Amanda Zahedi.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=8968.638s">No,</a> all of the programs are paid for either out of a grant, so everything that the students do, the transportation to and from STARBASE, all of that is included under the grant.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=9001.713s">I</a> can connect. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=9002.613s">I</a> know that, um, Rachel Perry does, you know, safety during the year, stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=9007.475s">And</a> with summer fun, I know that the reason they do it at the mistletoe is so that they have access to the pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=9013.437s">So,</a> um, I can connect with them and see how they do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=9017.078s">You</a> know, and see how EL students can be included in that.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=9028.442s">So</a> the summer fun program was going on at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=9033.104s">Elementary</a> Yale program going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=9036.245s">But</a> summer fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=9038.126s">Is</a> that five days a week or four days. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=9039.946s">It's</a> five days and it's five so we do have that fifth day because our program was only four days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=9045.448s">So</a> maybe I can talk to them about how students, Yale students can, you know, tag on a day of the week to participate in summer fun next year.<h2><a href="../2024-11-18_CNgTCdqBpp8/2024-11-18_CNgTCdqBpp8.html">City Council 06-07-22</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=792.703s">Paul</a> Evangelista, I was formerly with Century Bank in that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=798.847s">And</a> this location is a terrific opportunity for that same team that now flies under the Needham flag to move and continue to support both the local clients as well as the high-risk clients such as the cannabis industry that's coming to Mr. Gavin Medford.<h2><a href="../2022-05-09_UKy15P8nAPo/2022-05-09_UKy15P8nAPo.html">Special School Committee Meeting:  Budget May 9, 2022</a></h2>

 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=2804.418s">I'm</a> ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=2806.159s">I</a> can share my slides.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=2815.212s">Do</a> you want to do this or you want me to show mine? <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=2818.673s">If</a> you can show yours, I don't think I have yours at my fingertips. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=2823.334s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=2837.076s">Good</a> evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=2838.377s">Happy</a> budget season. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=2840.875s">This</a> is the chart that I give you pretty much every year when I give a presentation that discusses our enrollment numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=2849.122s">And</a> if you recall, our numbers are pretty fluid throughout the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=2852.385s">I</a> always try to find that fixed moment in time that will indicate what our numbers are. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=2859.371s">These</a> are the end of year numbers for going back to school year 17-18. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=2865.476s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=2868.095s">For</a> example, in 1718, we ended the year with 460 students, but at some point during the year, we may have had 490 students because we have students coming in and we have students going out. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=2881.0s">This</a> year, our current moment, at this moment in time, we're actually up to 577 students as of today, which is the highest number I've seen in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=2892.277s">The</a> majority of these are our newcomer students. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=2896.339s">I</a> mentioned this in, when I presented back in January, we had, I took member Ruseau and member Graham to, you know, different schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=2908.265s">And</a> we went into one of the newcomer classrooms that only had six students and that classroom exploded. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=2915.048s">We</a> currently have 38 students between two classes in that room right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=2920.453s">So</a> our numbers have grown significantly, and the majority of these students are newcomers who require the highest level of services in terms of periods of ESL a day, and also this includes content classes, as well as their English language development classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=2938.821s">With</a> that said, I <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=2941.569s">predict</a> that these numbers are going to continue to grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=2946.17s">We're</a> still registering new students. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=2948.03s">We</a> have 11 students on deck. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=2950.551s">And</a> just in the time when I presented back in January, which was about 15 weeks ago, we've increased our numbers by 62 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=2959.473s">This</a> is a result of the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=2961.233s">The</a> borders were closed last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=2963.614s">So</a> we're basically getting two years worth of students in a one year period of time, but I don't, <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=2970.797s">I</a> wish I could predict when this would level off. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=2973.919s">One</a> of the other struggles that we're having with our newcomer students, because they are coming in at all different times of the year, they will be newcomer students next year as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=2986.767s">So</a> we are still going to continue to get new students as we do every year, but we will be keeping students in the newcomer classrooms <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=2995.73s">longer</a> than we typically would because we don't have the time with our students that we would have in a typical year. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3001.654s">So</a> that's why I expect this to continue on to next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3004.396s">Does</a> anyone have any questions on this slide before I move on? <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3009.14s">All</a> right, does the screen change to kindergarten? <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3018.807s">Yes,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3020.107s">So</a> one of the, starting with kindergarten, I'm trying to <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3025.708s">predict</a> how many students were going to have a newcomers out of kindergarten. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3030.112s">If</a> you recall, we do not have a kindergarten newcomer program. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3034.235s">It's</a> best practice for our kindergarten students to be fully integrated in the mainstream, because most students are acquiring their English language development at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3044.01s">and</a> to be in a classroom with role models, with native English speaking students, help accelerate the learning process and English language development of the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3053.197s">This</a> year, we have 86 EL students in our K classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3058.221s">That</a> number is, again, the highest I've seen in my time here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3064.266s">Of</a> those 86 EL students, 44 of them are newcomers. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3070.835s">How</a> many of those newcomers are going to be recommended for first grade newcomers? <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3075.776s">I</a> don't know yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3076.776s">I</a> won't know until June. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3078.717s">But</a> if I were to look at the percentages and the rates, if you go back to the 2018-2019 school year, we had 53 EL students in kindergarten. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3092.919s">21</a> of them were newcomers. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3093.98s">Only</a> two were referred to first grade newcomers because these students were here all year. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3098.841s">We</a> didn't have students missing huge chunks of school because of a pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3103.903s">So,</a> you know, those students became pullout students and only two needed newcomers. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3109.165s">In</a> the 2019-20 school year, that number increased. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3113.027s">We</a> only had 26 newcomer kindergarten students. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3116.428s">but</a> 11 were referred to newcomers because the building shut down in March. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3120.85s">And</a> March to June is a critical time for our kindergarten students with their language development. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3126.152s">And</a> then last year we had hybrid, we had students on remote learning, we referred nine students. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3132.735s">That</a> was out of only 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3134.536s">We</a> have three times that amount this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3137.857s">I</a> can safely say at this point in time, even though I can't predict, I am going to need another first grade newcomer classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3149.851s">So</a> looking at our newcomer classes as of, I guess I made these slides on 425. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3155.119s">These</a> numbers have gone up, I can tell you that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3158.633s">We</a> currently have 20, well, I know we have 25 in first grade now. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3164.498s">I</a> can't speak for the other classes off the top of my head. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3167.641s">We</a> split this grade two classroom and added another teacher this year, and they're each up to 18 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3174.947s">Grade</a> three, we have 21, grade four, we have 20, grade five, we have 18, and then six, seven, and eight, we have 20, 22, and 18. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3184.261s">Again,</a> I think a larger percentage of these students that would typically be reclassified as pullout students are going to remain in EL, and we're going to continue to get new students enrolling. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3194.929s">And</a> this is why I'm asking for four more teachers.<h2><a href="../2022-01-10_RhUNhYl62Oo/2022-01-10_RhUNhYl62Oo.html">Regular School Committee Meeting - January 10, 2022</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5185.203s">Good</a> evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5186.223s">Happy</a> New Year. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5187.724s">Welcome</a> to Member Hays. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5190.165s">Every</a> January, we administer the ACCESS test, which is a single test comprised of four domains, listening, reading, writing, and speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5200.108s">So</a> it's actually four different tests that measure students' English language development. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5204.89s">And</a> we do compare from year to year, and students get a report, and families get a report from year to year. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5212.193s">The</a> test is taken online in grades 1 through 12, with the exception of grades 1 through 3, the writing portion of the test is paper-based. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5221.221s">And</a> for kindergarten students, the entire test is paper-based. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5225.465s">It's</a> given one to one. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5227.446s">one-to-one.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5228.687s">As</a> Dr. Cushing just mentioned, they extended the date out to March 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5234.051s">Typically,</a> we have a six-week window because, and especially at the elementary schools, because the tests are given to students based on their language proficiency and their grade level. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5243.578s">So</a> it's a big puzzle to put together when you're administering the tests for the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5250.303s">So</a> we staggered the tests throughout the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5252.745s">Because</a> we used Chromebooks last year, 100% of the online assessments were done on the Chromebooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5260.35s">We</a> had no issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5261.491s">The</a> technology department is working diligently right now to ensure that everything's up to date so the students can take their tests. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5270.017s">And</a> then we get the score reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5272.539s">They</a> didn't announce with the change in dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5274.641s">Typically,</a> we get the score reports at the end of June. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5279.303s">But</a> now, I mean, at the end of May, beginning of June, but now with the delay, I don't know if they're going to give them to us in August again, which is what they did this year for the 2021 access test. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5291.912s">So</a> I put together last year's 2021 data. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5295.174s">So</a> if you look at page two of your packet that has figure 1.1, this will give you the, <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5304.929s">basic</a> rundown of last year's access test for the overall test score for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5310.991s">So</a> this information compares Medford to the state access results and surrounding districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5317.333s">You</a> know, with the surrounding districts, the districts I chose are the districts that we have our English learner students transferring between. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5327.536s">So</a> these are the, you know, and coming into us from. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5333.246s">Students</a> can be exited from the EL program if they achieve an overall score of 4.2 so that's why you won't see a lot of students in level five and six because they exit typically before they hit that level. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5347.945s">At</a> the end of every school year, again, depending upon when we get the results, we have what we call language acquisition team meetings where I meet with all of the teachers and we use this data and other data to determine students' placements and if we reclassify them as a former English learner, if they can exit newcomers, how many periods of EL they need a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5368.516s">Access</a> is a big part of it, but it's not the only part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5372.515s">Going</a> back to the data if you look Medford had the highest participation rate of our neighboring districts we had a 95% participation rate on the test. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5381.101s">There</a> was no remote option for access. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5384.824s">So</a> it was all done in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5387.786s">Medford</a> had the highest percentage of students making progress on the access test, which is 44%, and 44% doesn't sound like a huge number, but compared to other districts during this, the pandemic, Medford definitely stood out. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5404.472s">So</a> this data supports, you know, Medford Public Schools pledge to equity because central office, the school committee ensured that our English learner students were back in school for in-person learning safely on September 28th, 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5423.661s">And</a> if we compare the other districts that did not do that, the results stand out that that was the right decision to support student learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5432.099s">And</a> this data supports the hard work that the teachers did last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5435.523s">Again,</a> it was a very trying year this year too. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5439.848s">And</a> then it's also, these results are a reflection of the amazing work that the EL teachers in the district did because they were among the first in the building to bring in-person learning back to our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5452.284s">So</a> I've said this before in previous meetings that yes, we can compare ourselves to the state because essentially Medford is a microcosm of ELs across the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5464.209s">And</a> then we can compare ourselves to other districts, but I always like to compare ourselves to ourselves year from year. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5471.829s">And</a> so looking at the previous year's data, so we administered the 2020 access test in January, February of 2020, and that was before the shutdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5481.756s">So</a> that data is an accurate reflection of a typical school year for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5488.42s">We</a> administered the 2021 access test in April of 2021, because they did extend the window. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5494.764s">And</a> so the shutdown in March of 2020 and the hybrid learning for most of the 2021 school year and then increased student absences, this all accounted for an immeasurable loss of instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5506.957s">And</a> when I say immeasurable, I'm not saying a huge loss of instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5510.661s">I'm</a> saying it literally can't be measured. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5514.429s">And</a> so when we look at our percentages, the percentage of students that were not making progress compared to the previous year increased by 9%. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5526.275s">And</a> so that obviously is not an increase we wanna see, but given the year that we had in the previous year, a 9% increase, it isn't huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5538.441s">It's</a> not bad data. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5541.175s">for</a> what our students actually, you know, did on the assessments. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5547.057s">And</a> then when I drilled down further, I looked at, you know, the highest increase of students not making progress that was in grade six through eight, which was 22%. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5556.739s">And</a> what that tells me is our co-teaching model and grade six to eight is critically important for our EL students because we did not have the same co-teaching model during the 2021 school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5568.379s">And</a> on your paper, if you go back to the previous page, I gave you a quick graph of students in grade six through eight making progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5576.73s">So</a> in 2019 46% of our middle school students made progress on the access test. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5583.199s">We</a> did have co-teaching in math that year only. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5586.368s">In</a> 2020, we had co-teaching in math and science. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5590.749s">And</a> so our progress jumped up to 54%. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5594.89s">Last</a> year, because of COVID and we couldn't cross teams and we couldn't integrate into other classrooms, our progress at the middle school level was 32%. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5604.992s">So</a> if this data tells me anything, it's that we need to continue with our co-teaching model and that the co-teaching model is <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5614.095s">a</a> successful measure for our ELL students. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5618.413s">So</a> then if we go to the numbers and percentages page, I like to give you the updates on our enrollment for EL students and using data from going back as far as 15, 16, and it tells the number of EL students and what percentage of our population that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5638.638s">And</a> so if we just compare us to last year, 2021, our numbers were down. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5644.46s">We</a> knew they were down, the borders were closed, people weren't permitted into the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5649.688s">So</a> we ended the school year with 410 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5654.416s">At</a> this moment in time, we are currently up to 511 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5659.261s">So</a> we've experienced, and this is our biggest increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5661.983s">We've</a> had over 500 EL students in the district at any given moment in the past, because we have a very fluid population of students coming in, registering, being settled for a small period of time, finding permanent housing somewhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5678.653s">But</a> right now, these are our current numbers in real time. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5681.354s">And</a> so that's 12.2% of the student population are current English learner students. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5689.019s">So</a> our numbers are, you know, as we've shown historically over the years, are growing and continue to grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5695.607s">And</a> then down below the student registration data, <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5700.569s">This</a> I always give you around this time in January when I present to you, to give you the number of students tested and the number of EL students that actually qualified for services. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5711.334s">So</a> for 2021, the data wasn't available because of COVID-19. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5716.697s">Our</a> typical format for identifying EL students was not the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5721.019s">The</a> state allowed us just to use the home language survey, do phone interviews, we could <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5726.181s">use</a> transfer paperwork from other districts, we didn't have to test every student who came through the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5731.726s">They</a> allowed us to actually use the access test to confirm our preliminary decision that the students were EL. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5739.832s">So</a> we didn't do the testing in 2021 like we typically did. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5744.216s">or</a> like we typically do. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5745.916s">But</a> as of now, we've tested 301 students, which is, again, a huge increase from 2020 when we were collecting this data. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5754.358s">And</a> of those 301 students, 244 have qualified for EL services. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5761.019s">So</a> again, our numbers do continue to grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5764.6s">Most</a> of our growth is coming at the newcomer level. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5768.22s">And</a> I've given you a chart to show you <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5772.464s">where</a> the newcomers are at each grade level. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5775.168s">So</a> of our current 511 EL students, 195 are level one or level two newcomer students. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5781.832s">And</a> the greatest increase is in grade two at the Mississippi and grades nine through 10 at MHS. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5787.616s">And</a> member Graham and member Ruseau, you were on the tours with Mr. Murphy and me back in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5794.84s">And</a> we went into that grade two classroom and there were only six students in it at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5800.463s">And</a> we now have 27 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5801.744s">So</a> we did, <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5805.905s">We</a> did split the class. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5807.206s">We</a> hired a new teacher and we ended up splitting the class into two because 27 newcomers is not feasible for anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5818.373s">And</a> so, you know, that took place right before the Christmas break or winter break that the split happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5828.559s">And</a> now we have two grade two newcomer classrooms, which is the first time that <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5833.689s">I've</a> ever had to split classroom in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5838.316s">And</a> then we've been capitalizing on you know as our funds, the title three grant to provide additional support because the numbers are high in the other classrooms as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5848.763s">providing</a> in-class tutors, EL aids. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5853.466s">We</a> have the two Lesley interns who are in grades three and grade two. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5858.949s">We</a> have a bilingual in-class tutor at the high school, and we have an in-class tutor at the middle school, all to support teachers and students. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5870.676s">But</a> these numbers will continue to grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5872.637s">We</a> do get another surge. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5874.438s">at</a> this time of year, especially from Brazil because their school year ended in December. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5879.907s">So</a> I am expecting these numbers to grow pretty quickly this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5886.215s">And</a> then on the last page, I just want to talk about some family engagement activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5891.639s">We're</a> in the process of building a partnership with an organization called Tech Goes Home. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5897.624s">Actually,</a> last year's Harvard resident, Tom Maliszewski, was the one who introduced me to this organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5905.289s">And</a> we tried partnering with them last year, but they weren't accepting any new districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5911.071s">So</a> I've stayed in touch with them and they've now opened up where they can take Medford on as a partner. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5918.434s">And</a> so this organization provides training to educate caregivers on technology usage. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5925.236s">Tech</a> Goes Home will train the teachers to administer the test, I mean to administer the class on technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5934.547s">The</a> caregivers will get a Chromebook and they'll get a year of free internet. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5941.692s">If</a> they successfully complete the 10 hour course. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5944.934s">So</a> I've recruited for EL teachers who will take the tech goes home training. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5948.716s">I'm</a> partnering I'm using title three funds to pay for the EL teachers to teach the courses. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5957.64s">If</a> they can complete the training early spring, we can offer a training this year and then start the school year with yet another training. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5967.685s">And</a> we can continue this partnership as long as TechPost Home can continue to provide the technology with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5974.568s">I</a> can use Title III to pay for the teachers to administer it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5980.551s">And</a> then other areas of family engagement, <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5984.83s">Our</a> family engagement begins the moment that the students arrive at the high school for their EL testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5991.732s">Emily</a> Plini is our new assessment specialist. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5995.354s">If</a> you recall, Jesse Reinhold retired last year in February. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=6000.095s">Emily</a> has taken on that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=6003.077s">She</a> immediately connects with families. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=6005.159s">She</a> sets them up with talking points. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=6007.481s">She</a> provides them all the information for Medford's multilingual resource line, the resiliency hub. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=6014.527s">She's</a> the connection between the school and the registration. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=6019.952s">And</a> she's really done an amazing job building this position even greater than it was under Jesse. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=6027.808s">She</a> does a great job at making families feel welcome and supported by the entire Medford community, not just the Medford school community. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=6037.333s">And</a> then we're doing our building-based family engagement nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=6040.535s">They</a> were originally scheduled for fall, but given the constant arrival of new students and families, the Yale teachers decided to wait until January. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=6048.218s">But</a> due to the uptick in COVID numbers, we're now delaying until February, March for these. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=6053.942s">and</a> those dates will be forthcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=6056.204s">And</a> then the District English Learner Advisory Council meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, May 24th at 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=6062.809s">in</a> the Library of Medford High School.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=6096.883s">It's</a> over. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=6097.503s">It's</a> up to the teachers who are delivering the classes to kind of make their own schedule for the 10 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=6105.948s">We</a> pay the contractual rate of $33 an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=6110.831s">And</a> then I'm actually paying them to go through the training with Tech Goes Home because that's technically their prep time for the course.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=6121.833s">It's</a> a 10-hour training course.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=6135.696s">So</a> it's on the, it's part of the Medford City Hall website and that supports families with where the food banks are and <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=6150.393s">I</a> think food banks and they help with housing and any issues that somebody's coming up with, especially for a new newcomer family coming into the district to get information. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=6165.201s">They</a> have the multilingual resource line. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=6167.142s">I'm</a> not sure if they're connected to each other physically.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=6188.789s">On</a> the city website, somebody dropped off. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=6190.95s">We</a> have the magnets that have like the telephone numbers for the multilingual resource lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=6196.593s">We</a> give them that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=6198.834s">Emily</a> directs them to the Medford City Hall website.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=6217.023s">So</a> the DELAC is the District English Learner Advisory Council, similar to CPAC. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=6223.369s">It's</a> supposed to be a self-run parent caregiver organization that will advise central office, advise the school on what they would like to see for their children and their students.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=6257.519s">And</a> that's why that's pushed out that way, because what we find is that caregivers will respond more to something happening at a building level than a district level. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=6270.328s">So</a> we're using the building level <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=6274.89s">events</a> to then springboard into the district level.<h2><a href="../2021-09-20_6z-adtwoqbY/2021-09-20_6z-adtwoqbY.html">Regular School Committee Meeting - 9.20.2021</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=2154.754s">None</a> of these programs could have happened without the teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=2158.597s">And</a> I just specifically have to call out Laney Cahill, Michelle Desio, Melissa Calendarian, Julia Mitchell, Matt McKenna, who ran the elementary program for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=2171.147s">And</a> then Ami Sanye at the high school who coordinated the high school program with support from Joel Menasha and David Perez. <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=2181.701s">And</a> then we had two EL in-class tutors, aides, who were doing family outreach, calling students when they weren't coming to the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=2192.309s">And</a> that was Mona Massawi and Sabrina Pinto. <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=2195.871s">And</a> they worked in the classrooms with the students as well, in addition to helping, you know, keep the program going. <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=2205.296s">With</a> regards to other updates, we hired six new staff members in the EL department this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=2211.962s">We</a> had three retirements, which I'll be talking to Susie about later, because I'd like to acknowledge them. <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=2219.129s">And</a> then we also had two resignations. <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=2223.619s">So</a> we have six new staff members, basically K through 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=2228.1s">We're</a> entering year two of the change to the Missittuck for grades one through four newcomers and fifth grade newcomers at the McGlynn Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=2239.623s">And</a> then we continue our Lesley University partnership. <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=2242.944s">This</a> year we have two full year interns working in the newcomer classrooms at the Missittuck. <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=2250.604s">And</a> then at the McGlynn Middle School, we're continuing with our co-teaching for math and science. <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=2256.568s">We're</a> going back to our pre-pandemic model where the students are actually part of the classroom and the teachers are co-teaching and we'll continue with that professional development because we do have some changes at the middle school with staffing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=2271.839s">So</a> we wanna make sure everyone's on the same page and continuing that professional development. <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=2278.145s">And</a> then we're going to be looking at our K through 12 curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=2282.482s">doing</a> some updates, we're going to be in the process of putting together a team to develop a writer's workshop program, because when we do the analysis of the access test, writing is typically the last domain to develop, and we're looking for ways to strengthen that to increase our writing scores. <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=2300.556s">And</a> then last year, you approved the funding through the ESSER funds to continue with the imagined learning, and we're in the process of onboarding that.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=2327.443s">So</a> it's the Early Elementary Urban Education Initiative through Lesley University. <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=2332.706s">So</a> teacher candidates have the, they're in an accelerated one-year master's program that will enable them to get their one through six gen ed certification with an add-on EL license.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=2374.943s">we</a> have a target date for another DELAC meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=2379.544s">I</a> think it's in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=2381.044s">So</a> the plan is for that to have teachers work at their building level to do, we always, when we come back to school, we'll do family information nights at the school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=2393.827s">And</a> it's just to help, you know, parents, caregivers, you know, navigate <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=2399.388s">the</a> back to school piece, how to use the website, how to email their teacher, and then we'll use that as a recruitment tool for the DELAC.

 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=2424.652s">No,</a> it's just the EL curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=2426.333s">We</a> follow the <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=2429.582s">frameworks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=2430.542s">Well,</a> they're not frameworks. <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=2432.003s">They're</a> the English language proficiency benchmarks and outcomes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=2436.764s">So</a> our curriculum is based on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=2439.685s">And</a> then the WIDA standards are folded into that because the WIDA standards focus on listening, reading, writing, and speaking.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=2450.729s">So</a> it's our own curriculum that incorporates <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=2453.989s">So</a> for the English piece, it incorporates the English language arts standards, the common core standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=2460.776s">We</a> bring in the English language development through the English language proficiency standards, and then the WIDA standards are a part of that as well.

 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=1896.332s">Good</a> evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=1898.655s">Thank</a> you for your time this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=1901.707s">With</a> regard to Imagine Learning, we used $5,000 of the CARES Act money last year to pilot test this with our newcomer students in grades six through 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=1913.672s">And</a> it was hugely successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=1916.533s">The</a> teachers liked it, the students liked it, the teachers reported progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=1921.315s">It's</a> an adaptive literacy program specifically geared toward English learners that gives frequent formative assessment along the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=1931.458s">So</a> the teachers can not only, it's a standalone program, but the teachers can use this data to incorporate the skillset into their instruction because of the vast formative assessments that are provided on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=1947.124s">And</a> so what I'm looking to do is increase that to expand it to some level three and four students, as well as bring it down to fourth and fifth grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=1958.643s">I</a> don't think we need it with primary grades because we do have Lexia for the K one and two and Going from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=1967.728s">And</a> I believe three is also using Lexia stop me if I'm not correct on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=1974.631s">And</a> then, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=1976.396s">In</a> terms of staffing I'm remaining level funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=1980.0s">We</a> did add a position last year to the high school, which was critical this year, because even though our overall numbers are low. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=1990.21s">because</a> of border closings and COVID, the numbers at the high school continue to grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=1995.274s">So</a> that position was desperately needed at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=2000.638s">Given</a> how things may change in the next coming year, I believe we're adequately staffed to support any new students coming into the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=2012.232s">With</a> regard to any additional expenses, I was looking to restore my textbook budget back to the funding from two years ago, which would be a $7,000 increase because of the changes in the US in the history curriculum at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=2029.719s">I</a> do need to purchase textbooks for our level one and two students who would be taking <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=2037.048s">uh</a> history uh as a as opposed to because world history got is combined into one class now u.s one and two are now separated typically we didn't offer u.s history for our newcomer students because of the trajectory that the students follow would be in year one they would take world one <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=2057.53s">year</a> two they would take world two. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=2059.691s">In</a> year three they could be in a mainstream history class. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=2063.313s">All</a> of the history teachers are SEI endorsed and they're typically level three students going into those history classes so you wouldn't need a separate program for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=2072.219s">Now</a> with the changes we do need the separate history program which means we would need we'd follow the same curriculum but we would need a textbook that would be a little bit different from what the mainstream uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=2083.145s">And</a> other than that everything else is staying the same.<h2><a href="../2021-04-05_FQmLWv7cB1A/2021-04-05_FQmLWv7cB1A.html">STRATEGIC PLAN ROUNDTABLES</a></h2>

 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6015.144s">Hi,</a> good evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6016.845s">Happy</a> New Year. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6018.933s">In</a> my report, I started with the access testing, which is typically done this month in January and through the first week of February, but the state did push that out to May 20th for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6031.762s">So</a> we've decided to start the testing in April because we won't get the test results any sooner if we start testing the students sooner. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6039.428s">So</a> we're looking to kind of recapture some of the lost time last year with the building closures in March. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6046.323s">and</a> we'll work around the MCAS schedules as those come out in the individual buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6053.806s">There</a> is no option for a remote access test. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6057.708s">It</a> has to be done in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6059.629s">So</a> even our remote students, we can make <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6063.004s">accommodations</a> for them to come into the building to take the testing if they choose to. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6067.927s">The</a> state is aware that we do have remote students, so I'm not sure how they're going to calculate the participation rate this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6076.973s">I</a> think they'll be a little bit forgiving due to the circumstances, but we'll obviously encourage people to <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6083.317s">come</a> in and test and that's the other advantage of waiting until April because people have been vaccinated. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6088.701s">With</a> the testing we have going on, I think we have a better chance of getting more students in if we wait until April to administer the tests. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6099.449s">I</a> think I share my screen, Dr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6105.574s">Yeah,</a> so we have <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6114.342s">So</a> this is the EL data dashboard that came out this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6118.345s">Yeah,</a> this is what's in your report. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6128.571s">We</a> did take access in 2020, because it was done in January before the buildings closed, but the Department of Ed hasn't put the data up yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6137.751s">Most</a> recent data I have for access testing is, you know, 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6142.435s">I</a> just wanted to show you, let me see if I can actually show you the actual website. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6150.983s">It's</a> a neat tool because they're adding, in-cast data, you can compare yourself to a variety of different districts for the purpose of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6165.66s">I</a> gave you Malden and Somerville, and that's mostly because those are the communities that we share students with. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6175.049s">Students</a> who are enrolling into Medford, transferring from other school districts, are coming from either Malden or Somerville are the two biggest. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6184.103s">And</a> so if you look here, this was, I know it's kind of small, this is 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6190.785s">This</a> was the 16, 17 school year, the entire, the state could dip, every community took a dip because they changed the test from access to access 2.0 and they changed the cut scores. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6202.828s">And</a> so this line here is the Medford line, because I realized you probably have a black and white copy and can't differentiate the lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6210.11s">So</a> although Malden has, <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6213.497s">decreased,</a> Somerville has decreased, State has decreased, Medford has been going up for our test scores. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6222.85s">And</a> again, I don't have the 2020 data yet to see where we fall on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6228.359s">and</a> to compare us with some other districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6232.322s">But</a> we do get individual score reports on students. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6236.386s">So</a> we know which students didn't make progress on access for 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6241.01s">And</a> we have systems in place in all of the buildings where the teachers create an individualized learning plan for students who aren't making progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6249.537s">We</a> look at the area, because if you recall, the access test is actually four different tests. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6255.582s">and</a> it's listening, reading, writing, and speaking assessments. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6259.905s">And</a> so we look at what area the student needs support in, and they put together a building-based team to give that student supports across all classes, not just in the EL classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6275.316s">And</a> so hopefully we will see an improvement the following year. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6281.06s">And</a> then again, with the advantage of getting <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6283.993s">the</a> tests delayed, we can kind of recapture some of that time that we lost last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6289.918s">I</a> also wanted to give you an elementary newcomer program update, because last year we debated and discussed about moving the newcomer program to, from the Brooks for grades one and two, and the Roberts grades three through five, we put grades one through four at the Columbus. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6309.706s">in</a> grade five at the McGlynn because that's where the majority of our students live. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6314.39s">And</a> I know we debated with all of the changes happening this year, but I have to say that I think it really, it was the right decision to do it this year because bringing cohort A in first gave us the opportunity to kind of get used to the school, get the systems and structures in place before the rest of the students came, you know, came in. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6335.626s">So</a> it did actually work out really well and I'm happy to report that <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6339.65s">you</a> know, the Columbus and the McGlynn, the newcomer classrooms are, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6344.991s">and</a> they were kind of the leaders of the school when the other cohorts came in. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6350.175s">So</a> that was kind of nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6351.977s">Additionally,</a> we haven't had to utilize vans for transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6356.22s">We've</a> been able to accommodate all of the students, transportation needs with the standard yellow buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6363.046s">So</a> the two vans that we're spending about $45,000 on last year, we haven't had to use this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6372.555s">I</a> gave you a report a couple of months ago about a Saturday program. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6376.9s">We</a> got a grant to do a Saturday learning program. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6381.24s">And</a> so that's going to begin on January 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6385.402s">We're</a> in the process of hiring and recruiting teachers for that, and then they'll do the outreach and recruiting of the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6395.227s">We're</a> targeting, again, newcomer students level one and two. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6399.509s">That</a> will be our first phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6400.95s">And</a> then depending upon the numbers, we can extend it out to three and four students. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6405.572s">And</a> we're doing this at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6407.633s">We're</a> targeting high school for this intervention because high school students have a finite period of time to develop their English language development to a point where they can pass MCAS and meet their graduation requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6420.576s">So</a> we wanna give them as much support as we possibly can. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6425.078s">We'll</a> break it down into English language development, fundamental math skills, algebra one, and some social emotional learning in there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6434.745s">In</a> addition to that, we've come up with some field trips that we can use Title III money for, for our English learners. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6443.749s">And</a> this is available at the elementary school. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6447.931s">The</a> New England Aquarium is offering some virtual field trips. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6452.093s">I</a> met with the teachers today who will be facilitating this. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6457.94s">and</a> coordinating this with the students and they're going to do the great sea turtle rescue and meeting the penguins, I think is the other one that was chosen. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6468.708s">So</a> that will be happening the first week in February. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6472.956s">And</a> then we have professional development happening at the McGlynn Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6477.681s">We're</a> in year three of the co-teaching model. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6480.384s">We</a> obviously had to make a change this year in terms of what that co-teaching looked like. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6485.069s">It</a> was an additional challenge for the content and the EL teachers because we really have three EL programs in that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6494.078s">We</a> have our four day a week <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6496.794s">Cohort</a> A, we have our typical hybrid students, and then we have our remote students. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6502.326s">So</a> they're juggling a lot where the EL students are. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6506.005s">you</a> know, are concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6506.925s">And</a> I have to say the content teachers and the EL teachers, I have to give them a big shout out because they've continued with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6513.928s">They</a> see the value in this inclusion model, even though it looks very different from what we did when we were in person, they're still connected to the mainstream classrooms, even though they're in the same building, it's virtually because we can't over put a capacity over in a classroom, but that connection is still there. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6532.837s">And</a> the teachers are working really hard to ensure that that continues. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6536.683s">So</a> we've had some professional development, you know, on that and what that looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6541.344s">And</a> right now we're in the coaching phase where, you know, teachers are signing up to meet with the EL coaches on either common planning time or observing a co-teaching lesson to get feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6554.628s">And</a> that's where they're at now. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6558.017s">And</a> then we're also doing some PD on culturally responsive teaching. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6562.96s">We're</a> doing it in the form of a book club. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6566.221s">Again,</a> this is a Title III sponsored event where Title III purchased the books for the teachers who sign up. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6572.845s">It</a> will be a three month PD. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6576.066s">We'll</a> read a memoir about a student's or a family's process of immigrating here to the United States and the challenges that they faced with that whole process and the impact it will have on students in their classrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6595.783s">And</a> then we have the Massachusetts Vision for Blueprint and English Learner Success. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6600.926s">I</a> mentioned this at a previous meeting as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6602.947s">I'm</a> on the advisory committee for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6606.089s">It's</a> going to be piloted in three districts this year, but we're developing self-assessment tools that districts can use to evaluate their own English learner education programs, curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6621.738s">I</a> like this program because it <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6624.938s">is</a> based on four different areas at the classroom level, the school level, the district level, and the state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6633.846s">And</a> I included an attachment, it's I think nine pages, that goes into much more detail about what the program is. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6640.671s">When</a> we restructured the McGlynn Middle School, I was on the <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6645.796s">initial</a> advisory committee for this, and they called it out as possibly being a model that fits their blueprint. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6654.262s">And</a> so I'm continuing with the work with them, because ideally, you know, this is something that will benefit the district and the EL and mainstream students in the district K through 12, not just at the middle school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6669.653s">And</a> then I gave you updates on our enrollment numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6672.735s">Our</a> EL numbers are down. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6674.696s">We</a> do have <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6676.016s">As</a> of Friday, when I put this together, we had 415 students, represents 10.3% of our total student population. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6687.043s">Interestingly,</a> the number of Yale students who have come in this year have been 114. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6694.78s">And</a> I think I told you, it's trying to hit a moving target. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6698.123s">We</a> have a very fluid population. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6700.185s">So</a> I always look at that one moment in time to get my numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6704.189s">And</a> so the numbers that you're looking at here for 2021 were as of that date. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6711.636s">the</a> numbers for all the previous years was how we ended the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6716.3s">But</a> that doesn't mean we only had 454 EL students in the district, because we have students move in and move out upwards of 30 to 40 students a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6729.43s">So</a> with that said, I don't know where our numbers will end for this school year, but we're currently at 415. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6739.01s">With</a> new students coming in, we have 114 students compared to 193 students at this time last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6747.957s">I</a> can't tell you how many students have come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6752.141s">In</a> the past, I've given you the number of students who have come in that we've tested, and some of them haven't qualified. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6760.462s">I'm</a> only giving you the number of students who have qualified because the testing and how that was determined this year because of COVID changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6769.248s">So</a> I can only give you the actual EL student numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6772.55s">So</a> even though we're down 80, almost 80 students, for new students coming into the district, our overall EL numbers are only down by about 40 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6785.089s">And</a> our numbers at the high school continue to grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6787.972s">We're,</a> I think, 116 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6790.494s">That's</a> where the bulk of our students are coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6792.595s">And</a> like I said, they're transferring in from other districts, not necessarily from other countries.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6862.528s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6865.049s">I</a> mean, the advantage to this model is that it's a shared responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6872.814s">And</a> that's what we're seeing from the EL side as well as the content side. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6877.206s">And</a> we are lucky in Medford that we have a newcomer program. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6882.291s">We</a> don't necessarily have to have it to the level that we do, but it's just about how we're using our resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6889.838s">And</a> I think we're using our resources much more wisely that allows us to have that newcomer program to provide support. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6897.765s">to</a> the students, but also to the content teachers, because it's challenging for a content teacher to have a non-English speaker in their classroom when they're responsible for getting through heavy duty content. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=6910.075s">And</a> so this co-teaching kind of helps balance that out.<h2><a href="../2020-11-17_s-4VJY_TglE/2020-11-17_s-4VJY_TglE.html">Regular School Committee Meeting November 16, 2020</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8410.352s">Okay,</a> so with the return to students on September 28th, we brought in our level one, level two EL students, K through 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8419.317s">All</a> of the teachers in the district went through PD sessions in August with better lessons. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8426.66s">And</a> the EL teachers took what programs they learned about through the better lessons and made them usable for EL students. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8438.446s">And</a> they also put together PD for the, you can go to the next slide here. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8445.902s">They</a> also put together PD for content teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8450.183s">to</a> kind of highlight what are some of the best practices in working with EL students. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8457.549s">So</a> this kind of covers some of the major areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8461.652s">Loom</a> was one program which allows teachers to kind of record video messages for their assignments because our EL students rely heavily on auditory <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8472.38s">input</a> in terms of direction and expectations and understandings. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8478.184s">Our</a> teachers put together exemplars and then can actually record voice directions for our students using that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8485.91s">Edpuzzle</a> is another one that allows teachers to kind of embed open-ended questions, multiple choice questions on YouTube videos and teacher created videos. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8498.679s">And</a> the next slide, Peter. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8502.323s">Screencastify</a> was something else that the teachers used and shared with their colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8507.726s">It</a> also allows them to give auditory directions. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8511.349s">And</a> then Vocaroo, they all have kind of silly names. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8515.411s">Again,</a> you can give oral feedback to the students on an assignment that they've submitted through Google Classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8522.335s">And</a> it also allows Yale students to <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8525.737s">It</a> facilitates conversations between EL students and working groups and on papers back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8538.645s">All</a> right, Joan.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=9112.049s">Just</a> to add to that, on those presentations, the EL teachers did do PowerPoint presentations for the entire school community, and they were placed in an asynchronous folder that was for the 10 days of opening of school, and teachers were doing professional development, some live, some asynchronous, and this was a asynchronous folder that was available to all teachers for these best practices.<h2><a href="../2020-08-04_wrDSsgezdHw/2020-08-04_wrDSsgezdHw.html">Reopening of Schools Community Feedback Opportunity</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=442.112s">I'm</a> Paul Texer. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=443.032s">I'm</a> the Director of English Learners for the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=445.672s">and</a> I was on the hybrid model as well.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1419.907s">So</a> we're designing the EL program to mirror what the mainstream students are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1425.794s">DESE</a> has not supplied us with specific guidance in relation to English learners, except for those English learners who are also duly identified as having an IEP. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1437.246s">So</a> once that guidance comes through, if we need to shift what the plan is for all students to accommodate DESE's requirements for ELs, then we'll do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1448.137s">But</a> for right now, we're sticking to the plan the way it's been written, and all EL families will have the same options as all the other students to choose remote, you know, or on what the model is that we go.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1491.095s">We</a> put together a hybrid model that would follow the same schedule for elementary, middle, and high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1498.277s">We</a> have two days of in-person instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1501.577s">Students</a> will be divided into a cohort, either Cohort 1 or Cohort 2. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1507.438s">Cohort</a> 1 will meet on Mondays and Tuesdays. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1510.079s">Cohort</a> 2 will meet on Thursdays and Fridays for live in-person. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1515.489s">On</a> Wednesday, that's when the teachers will do live remote learning to bring the two cohorts together as a full class, because the goal is that we will be returning to school and students will have the opportunity to know who is in their class. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1531.159s">On</a> the days that students are working from home, they will be doing asynchronous learning and dependent learning from their teachers, but it will be the same curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1541.649s">It</a> won't be a separate enrichment. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1544.491s">It</a> will be following the curriculum that has been laid out by grade level and subject matter.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=2538.862s">I</a> can talk a little bit about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=2541.404s">I'm</a> on the Professional Development Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=2545.834s">So</a> prior to getting these 10 days, the district was proactive by switching out the November PD day and making that happen in August. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=2556.487s">So</a> our teachers could do some online training on remote teaching, hybrid teaching, asynchronous learning for students as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=2566.218s">And</a> so that's through an organization called Better Lessons, and teachers have signed up for three two-hour workshops. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=2574.067s">And</a> then beyond those three two-hour workshops, teachers have access to coaches through Better Lessons to support the learning that they did in their professional development. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=2584.651s">And</a> that will go through pretty much to the end of October. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=2587.612s">So</a> getting those extra 10 days at the beginning of the year will allow us to strengthen that and provide some additional PD options for the teachers to prepare for what the new school year is going to look like.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=2616.998s">Yeah,</a> no, to add on to that, it's not just teachers, it's teachers, paraprofessionals and all administrators as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=2623.804s">So</a> it's the entire district that will be getting this professional development.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=2913.893s">Well,</a> we recognize this is a challenge for all families, whether we do a hybrid <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=2919.652s">If</a> we did half days, if we did two and a half days, if, you know, half, five days, half, you know, in the morning, half in the afternoon, there's no ideal scenario that works for all families.<h2><a href="../2020-08-04_n50NtLaAUqY/2020-08-04_n50NtLaAUqY.html">Reopening Schools Community Forum</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=520.386s">I</a> am the other Paul in the group. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=521.788s">My</a> name is Paul Tispera. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=523.249s">I'm</a> the director for English learners and I was on the hybrid committee putting together the hybrid schedule and logistics for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=533.868s">And</a> I'll turn it over to Joan Bowen.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=557.596s">And</a> we see Toni. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=559.896s">I</a> think she's having connectivity issues.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=923.908s">Dr.</a> Cushing, I can answer the second part of this question. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=926.87s">So</a> if a student has been in a hybrid classroom, they would continue on that path during the quarantine. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=933.996s">They</a> wouldn't jump into the remote. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=936.618s">At</a> least that's the plan at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=939.74s">Keep</a> in mind, this is still a draft, and this is why we're looking for feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=944.213s">But</a> we feel it's best for the student to maintain that consistency with the cohort of students, with the work that they're doing, and do that on a remote basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=955.563s">So</a> they wouldn't switch from like hybrid to the full remote if they're ill. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=959.706s">And</a> then also it's different for every student how, you know, to the level of illness they may have if they're not capable of <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=967.914s">jumping</a> in and doing the work because they need the rest and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=972.265s">So</a> we would keep the students where they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=998.689s">So</a> for this question, we decided to look at the chunks of instruction in four to six week periods and reassess at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1036.371s">And</a> I think we may have lost Tom as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1038.257s">So</a> I'm just going to go to the comment section.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1160.812s">And</a> with the hybrid model, the way it was set up is we divided the, you know, we would be dividing the students into two cohorts, cohort one and cohort two. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1170.478s">Cohort</a> one will be in school on Mondays and Tuesdays. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1174.098s">and</a> they will do their independent asynchronous learning on Thursdays and Fridays. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1178.984s">The</a> teacher will then be with cohort two on Thursday, Friday for the live in-person instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1184.731s">And</a> the students in cohort two would do their asynchronous learning on Monday, Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1189.817s">Wednesday</a> is a remote day for everyone and this is an opportunity for the teachers to bring cohort one and cohort two together because that is the full makeup of the classroom for some remote live instruction for the students because that will support students with whichever direction we end up going into. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1209.644s">If</a> we end up having to go full remote because the governor does another shutdown, the students will have had experience with the remote learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1217.777s">from</a> their teacher and that would be their class, or if things get better and we can return to school full time, those students will be able to have had opportunities to interact with the other students in the other cohort, which is the makeup of their class.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1258.612s">I</a> can talk about what we did at the elementary level. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1262.878s">Joan,</a> you were part of the high school, but at the elementary level, we're doing an asynchronous schedule for the elementary students when they're home. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1272.148s">And</a> we're giving them the amount of time that they should be spending doing their asynchronous learning for each class on the days that they're home. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1282.119s">Joan?</a> 
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1517.623s">There's</a> a question about Monday, Tuesday holidays and how that would impact in the hybrid model. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1524.185s">At</a> least for the first half of the year, we did count out and the Monday, Tuesday group would have one less day than the Thursday, Friday group because we have Monday holidays, we have a Tuesday, <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1541.012s">the</a> election day, but then in November, and we're not sure how long this will extend into, we have the Thursday, Friday for the Thanksgiving break. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1550.058s">So</a> it's evenly balanced with the exception of one day.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1601.278s">can't</a> guarantee that at this point in time because we don't know what the structure will look like and we can't say every lesson is going to be recorded. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1610.046s">So</a> if the student is absent and attendance will be taken, they would make up the work like they typically would if they had missed a day of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1618.433s">But</a> school times and class times are not optional. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1624.086s">like</a> they were, you know, it was a little bit less structured in the spring with the abrupt closure of the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1633.009s">But</a> this is a school day and the school times are something that, you know, teachers and students all have to adhere to.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=3442.942s">There</a> was a question about recess that I can address. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=3446.664s">The</a> recess schedules will be made by the building principals, but when we did the hybrid schedule, we did allot time for recess to coincide with lunch for all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=3459.15s">And,</a> you know, every school is set up differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=3461.791s">The</a> Columbus has two separate areas where one group can go to one side, one can go to the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=3468.855s">I</a> know all of the buildings don't have that much space around them, but they're going to structure it where students can still play, but do it in a responsible manner.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=3919.195s">I</a> just want to add, you know, we've spent the past couple months trying to look at how we can completely redesign schools in the middle of a pandemic and keep everybody safe and still provide a quality education. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=3931.642s">There</a> were some questions about teacher professional development. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=3934.9s">We</a> are offering professional development for teachers to make this adjustment because we're asking teachers to completely change the way they've taught, whether it's a hybrid model or remote model, this is something completely new. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=3947.648s">Prior</a> to getting the extra 10 days front loaded at the beginning of the year, we did opt to take that Tuesday election day and make that a PD day for teachers in August. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=3960.096s">They've</a> been given a platform on a, <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=3964.025s">by</a> a company called Better Lessons, which is specifically designed to support teachers with their instruction in a remote model, a hybrid model, and how they can make that curriculum accessible synchronously and asynchronously. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=3979.32s">That</a> contract with Better Lessons will go through, even though the training happens in August, <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=3985.308s">they</a> get to remain on as coaches, I think, through October. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=3988.611s">So</a> teachers will still have access to that professional development once they're in the thick of trying to juggle this different style of teaching.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=4109.876s">And</a> also if I could just add with the better lessons professional development, that wasn't, it's not just for teachers, paraprofessionals and administrators are also participating in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=4119.309s">So</a> as a district, everybody is on the same page.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=4236.088s">So</a> we lost Peter. <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=4244.871s">I'm</a> not sure if everyone can hear me well.

 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10058.701s">No,</a> not a postal mailing. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10060.502s">It's</a> all been emailed, but the EL teachers are the ones doing the outreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10065.263s">They've</a> had systems in place prior to the closure of schools where they would reach out using online texting called talking points. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10077.006s">Some</a> use remind 101. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10079.808s">So</a> they've always had this outreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10081.45s">So</a> even with that, there are the 30 students that we haven't been able to get in touch with. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10087.194s">And</a> so they've reached out to the translators who are trying to call home. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10091.778s">Somebody</a> talked about using phones to call and dialing star 671st. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10096.702s">They're</a> finding that they don't pick up if it's a private number. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10100.185s">Also,</a> they can't leave their personal cell phone number. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10103.917s">to</a> call them back. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10105.098s">So</a> it's not like we have the advantage of being in school, but the teachers are continually doing the outreach and they're keeping a log of which students they can't get in touch with and which students aren't responding to what they put out on Google. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10118.465s">And</a> so we'll have that list and we'll just kind of keep going at it to try to get to the kids that aren't responding or the families that aren't responding.<h2><a href="../2020-01-15_l7UJNCM5bg4/2020-01-15_l7UJNCM5bg4.html">Medford School Committee January 13, 2020 meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2457.561s">Good</a> evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2458.422s">Good</a> evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2458.962s">And</a> welcome to the new members. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2460.183s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2461.263s">And</a> to follow up to answer your question, it's kind of like a three-way call. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2465.285s">You</a> call into the calling center, you identify which language you need, they get somebody on the line, and then everyone's dialed in at the same time.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2476.98s">So</a> we are in the middle of access testing, and for those of you unfamiliar with access, it is a state-mandated test. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2485.563s">It</a> is administered over a series of several days. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2490.104s">Every</a> building is a little bit different because the test is different depending upon your grade level. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2495.486s">This</a> test measures the four domains of language, reading, writing, listening, and speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2501.661s">And</a> we get the reports at the very end of May, beginning of June, and we use this data to make our placement determinations for students for the following school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2511.893s">So</a> the high school has completed their access testing with the exception of make-ups. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2518.12s">Currently</a> the Roberts and the McGlynn Elementary are doing their access testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2523.844s">Columbus</a> will be starting on Wednesday, McGlynn Middle School on Tuesday, and then the following Wednesday, or I'm sorry, the following Thursday begins the Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2535.931s">So</a> we'll be completed with our access testing across the district by January 26th. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2540.794s">We</a> space it out so <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2543.095s">We</a> can have the appropriate technology support in each of the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2546.417s">The</a> first couple days are the most critical because if there are any issues that need to be addressed, that sets the stage for the rest of the testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2558.402s">I</a> did give you 2019's access scores in the chart. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2563.725s">I'm</a> not going to read it to you, but if anyone has any questions on that or the test, I can answer those now.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2594.575s">So</a> with the Columbus, if you notice from 2017, they had a huge increase between 2017 and 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2599.098s">They</a> went up over 24 percentage points. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2600.479s">And</a> I think maybe this is leveling off this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2610.813s">In</a> terms of the decline itself, what we do is we get a report from the state on each individual student who has not made progress on the access test, and each EL teacher in the building gets a progress monitoring form for that student. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2627.399s">They</a> get the previous year scores, the second year scores. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2630.68s">They</a> put together a building-based team, which would include the classroom teacher, the EL teacher, if they receive Title I, <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2638.702s">and</a> kind of put together supports for the students across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2643.544s">They</a> identify the areas of need, and based on those areas of need, so we're consistent, that's what's being delivered in the EL classroom for intervention and support, and that tier one is happening across the board for the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2656.73s">So</a> that should continue to boost scores. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2659.651s">We</a> do that at every school. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2662.997s">And</a> then with Medford High School, we looked at our curriculum and we actually added another class this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2670.487s">We</a> added a level of EL between 1 and 2, 1.5, it's original, to support the students who <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2678.977s">may</a> have come last year, but they weren't here for a full year, so they weren't quite ready for the level two, or some students test in at that level, so we added that level to try to catch students at the earlier stages of language acquisition. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2692.906s">So</a> that's how the two areas have been met on that.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2768.436s">Not</a> enough students to get the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2771.742s">So</a> I get the individual student reports, but the Department of Education doesn't have enough, there aren't enough EL students at the Brooks to put together the same data as the other schools.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2789.03s">Yes,</a> the individual student reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2790.931s">So</a> anyone who's not making progress, we follow the same protocols at the Brooks.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2800.573s">And</a> just with regard to the targets, meeting targets, those targets are established individually for students as well, and they do the same thing for the Brooke students. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2812.28s">Again,</a> there's just not enough students there to come up with the same calculations that they come up with.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2821.533s">No,</a> so every student gets an individual target. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2824.656s">So</a> based on where they were the previous year and so part of that progress monitoring report takes that into account that we know where that student needs to get for the next level. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2834.465s">And</a> then they take all that information and that's how they make the overall determination. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2841.111s">if</a> the schools met their target, and then as a whole, if the district met their target, which each school did meet a target, and the district met their target.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2860.693s">So</a> with the Brooks, it's a little bit different because they only, for the newcomer students, they house grades one and two. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2868.876s">So</a> if they're a first year student, we wouldn't get data on those students because we don't have something from the previous year. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2875.398s">So</a> it's only the students who have been here two or more years.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2913.147s">They</a> get breaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2914.107s">So</a> again, it's very different at every level. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2916.448s">So</a> kindergarten is an individual one to one test and it takes about an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2921.329s">So</a> there are no, you know, the teacher can give breaks along the way if the student, if the teacher feels that the student needs it. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2928.872s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2929.692s">So,</a> for grades 1 through 12, if they're doing the online, we usually do listening first and then reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2936.475s">The</a> listening test takes anywhere from 30 to 40 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2940.297s">So,</a> we'll do that first while we have everyone in the lab and then students get a break before they jump into the reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2946.92s">And</a> the reading test will take about 60 to 70 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2950.382s">And</a> that's all they'll do in one day. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2952.863s">And</a> then the next day, they would come back and do the writing portion, which takes about 60 or 70 minutes for the writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2961.088s">And</a> the speaking is about 30 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2962.969s">It</a> really depends on the student's language proficiency level. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2965.591s">Newcomers</a> will, it's a, the test is tiered. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2970.814s">So</a> you start here, and once you hit a stopping point, you don't continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2974.896s">So</a> that could be as quick as 15 minutes for some students, as long as 40 minutes for others.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3043.928s">This</a> has been a, this is, we're in year two of this and we started last year with just science teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3048.991s">And</a> so Rocco Cieri was huge in helping to bring that, you know, Nick Tucci was huge in bringing about that shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3056.535s">Um,</a> so having the support <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3058.956s">you</a> know of everyone and then this year we extended it Bernadette Riccadeli is kind of overseeing the Co-teaching across the two middle schools because we're also doing the same thing for special ed and the content areas So it's it's grown from there.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3105.442s">There</a> is no EL program at the Andrews.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3128.196s">So</a> in terms of number of students, they've always hovered anywhere between 75 and 90 students, EL students at the Columbus, grades K through five.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3143.347s">Between</a> 75 and 90 every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3145.549s">So</a> in terms of the increase, again, they went up. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3151.207s">24</a> percentage points, so you know that would be for anyone who was there in kindergarten Starting that you know you need to be there two years to get this growth You know so it's kind of the consistency the building capacity in the school with the curriculum the alignment of <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3171.553s">We</a> started doing benchmark assessments with the students using journeys. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3178.496s">We</a> had PLCs come across the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3181.578s">I</a> know the Columbus teachers participated in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3184.539s">It</a> was voluntary in year one where they would look at student data. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3190.141s">The</a> assessments weren't for grading students. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3193.022s">It</a> was for finding out what they know and what we need to reteach. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3196.944s">And</a> so I think they embraced that. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3200.107s">really</a> brought that along.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3207.369s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3207.789s">So</a> we embedded for the, we use the journeys as our curriculum for what we call our pullout students. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3214.131s">We</a> don't use that with our newcomer students. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3216.112s">We</a> might use bits and pieces of it in the newcomers program, but <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3220.378s">We</a> use, you know, they follow the journeys in their English class, and the English language development standards have been matched with the appropriate chapters and units and pacing guides with journeys.

 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7437.637s">Good</a> evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7438.298s">I</a> will be quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7439.18s">It's</a> like 9,000 degrees in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7444.709s">Sorry,</a> I have to start the projector. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7489.668s">Good</a> evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7492.688s">The</a> EL department had a successful summer, or successful summer programs, and that was thanks to the support of May Abu Hassan, Ghislaine Pinto, Emma Rangel, Laney Cahill, Amanda Davis, Teresa Casagnetti, and David York. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7509.243s">I</a> ran three concurrent programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7511.925s">High</a> school students were able to take summer classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7515.387s">to</a> make up missed credits or get extra credits during the summer to help with graduation. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7520.549s">It</a> was all funded through the Title III grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7523.691s">Middle</a> school students had five weeks of project-based enrichment activities, and they focused on social studies and science. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7533.895s">Each</a> week, the Yale Summer Enrichment Program had a theme with a culminating field trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7538.817s">So</a> the first week was learning about Massachusetts history, <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7544.054s">They</a> got to learn interesting facts, the geography of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7548.015s">The</a> week ended with a mini civics lesson and a trip to the State House. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7553.956s">Students</a> had the unique opportunity to view government, both past and present, here in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7562.398s">In</a> the second week of the program, students researched famous bridges and structures from around the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7568.697s">They</a> learned the engineering design process, and the project ended with an in-house field trip from Rita Advani. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7575.202s">She's</a> a scientist and engineer who helped the students construct bridges, beams, and columns with paper products and tested weight loads with textbooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7585.07s">Everything</a> was created with paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7587.592s">Students</a> designed their own bridges. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7589.693s">They</a> did the weight loads using nuts and bolts to determine what load could be handled on their bridges. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7599.929s">And</a> then the third week of the program focused on rules of the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7604.01s">In</a> the classroom, students learned grammar, vocabulary, number graphing, developing step-by-step, developing and following step-by-step instructions. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7614.252s">And</a> the week ended with a game day in the courtyard at MHS. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7618.573s">Students</a> played Paper Battleship, Cornhole, Headbands, and Yahtzee, Giant Jenga. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7627.396s">During</a> the fourth and fifth weeks of the program, students learned about oceans and marine life. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7631.897s">They</a> researched endangered species, analyzed the reasons for near extinction. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7636.699s">The</a> project ended with a field trip to the New England Aquarium. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7644.263s">The</a> third program was Starbase. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7647.044s">This</a> is our second year with our partnership with Starbase. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7650.635s">and</a> that's a STEM lab at Hanscom Air Force Base. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7653.938s">So</a> students got to design crash test cars, and they worked in teams to choose three safety features to a modified matchbox. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7665.146s">And</a> then they crashed their car with an egg to determine which safety features would be the most effective. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7672.511s">They</a> got to pick the safety features. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7674.333s">They</a> could only use items that were available in the lab. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7678.595s">Then</a> students designed robot cars and they had to code, write the code to program them to have them go around the track. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7688.421s">They</a> had to start and stop in the right place on the map. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7691.382s">They</a> had to stay on the track as well as calculate all of the turns. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7697.461s">And</a> then these robot cars were kind of transformers that grew some arms and legs. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7703.265s">And</a> the students had to program these cars to travel on the surface of the moon and pick up garbage and throw it away. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7710.711s">And</a> students wrote the code to move, lift, and drop the trash into the designated areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7717.215s">And</a> then students made their own derby cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7720.256s">And</a> then they raced them using CO2 propulsion, and they made predictions on which cars would go fast based on design and design elements, again, going back to the engineering design process. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7732.866s">All</a> of this was covered under the Title III grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7740.114s">And</a> then it happens at Hanscom Air Force Base. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7743.077s">We're</a> not drafting students for the military, but this is where the STEM lab happens to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7747.982s">And</a> so students got to see a parade, and they also have people come in to talk about STEM careers. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7755.069s">That's</a> also part of the program that they get to take part in.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7769.059s">I</a> would have to look, but the males definitely, I think it's probably, one, two, three, four. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7779.383s">I'd</a> say six to three, so six males, three females. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7785.526s">Although,</a> there were 11 students in the program, so I don't know where some are right now in this picture, but I can look up the data for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7796.656s">Any</a> questions on the summer programming before we move on to the next part? <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7803.438s">So</a> for the enrollment data, last January I gave a presentation on the enrollment numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7809.28s">And</a> as I explained back then, we have a pretty fluid population. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7812.321s">It</a> changes from year to year. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7814.349s">week</a> to week basically. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7815.71s">At</a> one point in the district, at one point we had 500 English learners and then that changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7822.235s">And</a> then of course in June we have our end of year meetings to determine placement and that changes the numbers for the following year. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7830.923s">I</a> did look it up and last year we reclassified 88 students in the district as from being English learners to being former English learners. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7841.656s">And</a> so that obviously brought our starting numbers down in this September because of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7850.501s">But</a> the Parent Information Center is registering new students and new families are coming in every day and it's still happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7858.005s">So</a> I just... <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7863.001s">put</a> this together to give you that moment in time for new enrollments. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7867.083s">So</a> September 18th, 2018, we had tested 165 students, and of those 165 students, 110 qualified for services. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7869.945s">September</a> 18th, 2019, this year, we tested 211 students, and of those 211, 138 are English learners. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7873.407s">So</a> these are our numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7889.787s">for</a> this point in time in terms of new enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7892.269s">But</a> this also doesn't count students who have transferred in from other districts that we have scores for. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7897.674s">If</a> they had taken access in their previous district, we don't test them upon intake. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7901.597s">So</a> the number of Yale students is slightly higher than that 138 for new students. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7909.992s">There</a> are also, as of the writing of this, there are currently eight students waiting to be medically cleared, and I don't know how many students are still somewhere in the registration pipeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7918.675s">But</a> most new enrollments at this point in time through the Parent Information Center are English learner families. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7925.36s">I</a> also want to take a moment to acknowledge Jessie Reinhold, who's the assessment specialist for the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7932.223s">Jessie</a> is welcoming to our family. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7934.563s">She's</a> exemplary at her job. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7937.084s">She</a> takes time with each family and with each student that she tests. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7942.486s">She's</a> extremely detail-oriented. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7944.327s">She</a> makes placement decisions with 100% accuracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7947.828s">And</a> she's a tremendous asset to the EL department and to the EL families in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7952.53s">I</a> couldn't do this without her. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7954.571s">And</a> these 211 tests, it's a four-domain test, reading, writing, listening, and speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7961.855s">The</a> test can take upwards of three hours per student, especially if they're in high school and they have English and we have to administer the math test. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7971.279s">So</a> she does this single-handedly, and it's pretty amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7974.36s">I'm</a> lucky to have her. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7977.946s">And</a> then the last part of the report is Lesley University. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7981.508s">This</a> is my second year with the partnership that I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7984.17s">And</a> this is different from the district's partnership with Lesley University. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7989.273s">We</a> get, it's the Elementary Education Urban Initiative, EEUI program. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7996.498s">And</a> so the teachers in this program are in a master's program to get elementary ed certified. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8002.062s">And</a> they get an add-on EL license. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8004.264s">And</a> how they do that is, <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8006.607s">by</a> doing a year-long internship in one of our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8010.249s">So</a> last year we had two interns, Emma Rangel and Lisa Petri, and we actually hired Emma to fill a retirement at the McGlynn Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8021.616s">She's</a> sixth grade certified, so, and that comes in with the, <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8026.872s">partnership</a> that I have with Nick Tucci and Faiza Khan with shifting the math program over to co-teaching as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8036.003s">That</a> allowed us to have co-teaching in both science and math. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8042.57s">The</a> math is new this year, but we're also continuing with the professional development we gave to the teachers last year, the science and EL teachers on co-teaching. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8050.296s">So</a> we'll go into year two of that, and then math teachers will run concurrently with that as year one. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8057.862s">So</a> the Lesley program gives us the opportunity to basically get second year teachers who have been trained by <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8065.208s">The</a> best teachers we have, we use Christine Hingston, who is at the Roberts, was one of the teachers who mentored one of the candidates, and then Teresa Casagnetti was the other, who also mentored Emma, who we ended up hiring. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8083.034s">So</a> it's kind of a win-win program, where we get a pool of teachers who have been trained by our best teachers to come into the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8095.824s">And</a> then this year we have two more. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8097.927s">One</a> is at the Brooks School this year working with mainstream classroom teacher, Suzanne Sarami, and Allie Kennedy, an EL teacher, and then Christine Hingston has another intern in her program at the Roberts this year.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8132.214s">Which</a> one? <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8132.934s">The</a> Starbase or the enrichment? <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8135.817s">Both.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8136.417s">Yes,</a> I mean so the biggest struggle is finding teachers to do the program and that's again why I wanted to make sure I acknowledged everybody because without them there wouldn't have been a summer program. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8147.645s">It</a> was a struggle trying to find a teacher to do the entire five weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8151.849s">So</a> then that's when we kind of brainstormed and came up with the idea of doing theme weeks and different teachers did the different weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8159.295s">And</a> so that worked out really well. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8161.057s">And</a> so hopefully we can just expand on that next year.<h2><a href="../2019-01-16_1uNjYgTELYs/2019-01-16_1uNjYgTELYs.html">January 14, 2019 Medford School Committee meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4420.356s">I</a> don't need it just yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4421.637s">That's</a> kind of the tail end of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4436.88s">I</a> believe everyone has a copy of the report in your packet, so I'm not going to read it to you, but just to give you the high-level parts. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4446.103s">The</a> CPR, the EL department is in compliance and is out of corrective action as of November 15th. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4457.587s">For</a> the McGlynn redesign update, as I said, I've been meeting with teachers to, you know, get their feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4465.708s">to</a> see what improvements or changes need to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4469.454s">We've</a> been working on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4470.635s">We</a> started a professional development program to help the co-teachers who are working with EL teachers that now have level one students in their classrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4480.45s">That's</a> new for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4483.132s">I've</a> received the evaluations and I've received positive feedback on the program that's being put into place to support both the EL teachers and the science teachers and obviously the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4500.859s">I'm</a> sorry?
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4502.26s">No,</a> that's a different, that was with, it's an organization, they're an EL consulting group called Confianza, and they specialize in working with English learners and co-teaching models, and it was actually perfect for what we brought to the McGlynn for our changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4524.528s">The</a> Lesley University partnership is an internship partnership. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4529.19s">So</a> Lesley University has a program where teacher candidates can get their elementary certification as well as their EL certification in like a 15-month period. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4542.037s">It's</a> pretty intense. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4544.085s">So</a> they do a year-long internship with a duly certified EL and content teacher, elementary certified teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4554.813s">So</a> we have one at the McGlynn and one at the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4558.335s">They</a> work Monday through Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4560.557s">They</a> started in August. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4561.838s">They'll</a> finish in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4563.379s">They</a> take all of their classes after school hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4566.281s">So</a> that's the intense part. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4569.223s">But</a> what works out really well is not only is it a benefit to those buildings and those schools having another person in, they get an educational experience that's, it's like coming in as a second year teacher in your first year. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4582.533s">It's</a> pretty amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4585.075s">So</a> hopefully, you know, we'll continue that partnership next year and as numbers continue to grow, we can spread it into other buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4595.387s">We're</a> currently in the middle of our access testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4598.23s">If</a> all goes according to plan, we will be done by January 26th, which I think is the earliest we've ever been done in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4606.418s">Technology</a> department, I have to give them credit. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4609.722s">They</a> really busted to make sure that we got everything up and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4616.228s">The</a> additional devices that have been purchased over the years also have contributed to us being able to decrease the number of days we're actually testing our students, and then we can get back to teaching them. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4629.542s">And</a> then I did put on here 2018, last year's access data. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4634.843s">It's</a> on the chart. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4636.204s">And</a> in every single building, we either met or exceeded our targets. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4641.605s">DESE</a> has a very complex system for establishing these targets, and they changed again for 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4649.087s">So</a> I don't know what they'll look like next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4652.848s">It's</a> literally like trying to hit a moving target. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4656.989s">It</a> changes from year to year, but just looking at the growth, that's kind of what I was focusing on. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4664.692s">The</a> growth in all of the buildings was incredible. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4669.674s">Even</a> though at the middle school level we may have gone down, we still met the target. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4674.516s">I</a> will be curious next year to see how this redesign of the middle school program will change that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4681.135s">We</a> get these results in June, like last day of May, first day of June. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4687.76s">They</a> won't actually give us these targets. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4689.841s">We</a> won't get that till over the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4692.944s">Over</a> the summer, we'll get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4694.425s">But</a> I'll give you a similar report next year to see where that lands. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4700.249s">Any</a> questions on any of this?
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4714.414s">Oh,</a> the N.A. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4715.455s">means</a> that there's not a large enough population to get the data to make a target and submit the target.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4726.842s">No,</a> because the numbers are so small, it's statistically insignificant and the department doesn't actually give us any data for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4738.252s">So</a> they do take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4740.594s">And</a> the struggle that we have with the Brooks is because the newcomers program is first and second grade, which is now our larger population, their first year was last year.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4756.214s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4758.076s">And</a> then in the other grade levels, there may only be five students in fifth grade, four students in fourth grade, and that's not enough data to actually put, to build the targets or to give us any <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4771.592s">I</a> don't have that data, but I can look at individual students to see who's making progress and who's not making progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4778.416s">And</a> that was something that we did at the beginning of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4781.758s">And</a> all of the teachers received a progress monitoring form, regardless of whether it was the Brooks or the Roberts or the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4790.882s">They</a> received a progress monitoring form for all the students who didn't make progress, all of the individual students who didn't make progress.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4814.186s">That's</a> one factor.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4825.189s">Access</a> isn't just for newcomers. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4827.069s">It's</a> for any student who is currently listed as an English learner in the district.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4850.968s">Of</a> total population of English learners at the Brooks is not high enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4856.353s">And</a> with the first and second grade, which is our higher number, the students if they're first year? <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4863.359s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4864.64s">There's</a> no, it's based on their growth from the previous year. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4868.964s">So</a> those students can't be calculated into it, just like the students in the third grade at the Roberts can't be calculated into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4876.67s">But</a> there are enough other students in grade three to get that statistical figure.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4896.024s">So</a> yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4896.645s">I</a> mean, the McGlynn, the Roberts, Columbus, they're all anywhere from 75 to 90 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4912.488s">And</a> then obviously, kindergarten isn't included in this either, because that would be the first year, regardless of what building they're in.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4939.445s">Well,</a> not by percent, but I can tell you Portuguese is our number one language, followed by Haitian Creole, and then Spanish and Arabic are kind of tied neck and neck for third, and then everything else is, yeah.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4957.734s">I'd</a> have to look it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4958.774s">I</a> wouldn't be able to guess that.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4976.447s">With</a> a registration process, I'm not quite sure.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4981.929s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4982.409s">I'm</a> not sure.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4987.951s">For</a> incoming, I wouldn't be able to determine that number. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4991.592s">But</a> for kindergarten, I can figure out how many we have currently this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4998.434s">I</a> wouldn't want to venture a guess.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5009.362s">With</a> regard to our Arabic-speaking families, because most of our Arabic-speaking families are coming here for medical reasons, there's an organization called, I think it's International House, <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5021.24s">And</a> they always send translators with our Arabic-speaking families. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5025.343s">It's</a> very rare that we need to, for the registration process. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5030.306s">The</a> Parent Information Center has gotten to know many of the translators from this organization very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5038.31s">Yep.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5059.267s">So,</a> hang on, let me just go down my list.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5089.321s">That</a> wouldn't be a factor on which school the students go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5093.204s">It</a> is still based on their neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5095.346s">The</a> only difference would be for the newcomer students where we funnel them to <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5100.655s">The</a> Brooks for grades one and two, and then the Roberts for grades three to five.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5110.303s">So</a> for the newcomer program, so at the Brooks, grade one has a teacher, grade two has a teacher, and then there's a pull-out, what we call pull-out EL, and she services grades three through five. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5125.796s">So</a> there are three teachers at the Brooks.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5132.795s">And</a> then the McGlynn Elementary is all pullout. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5137.519s">And</a> so all of these figures are determined, I mean, the number of staff that we have in each building is determined not only by grade level, but we have service hours that we're required to provide to EL students based on their level. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5152.271s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5154.272s">Levels,</a> you know three four and five students which require one to two periods a day depending upon their level So we have three teachers at the McGlynn elementary and they're all pull out and they're all pull out.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5166.865s">And</a> then at Columbus Elementary, we have three, same setup, three teachers, and same setup as the McGlynn, where they're mostly levels three, four, or five students. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5179.274s">And</a> then the Roberts, we have one dedicated teacher per grade level, grade three, four, and five. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5185.879s">For</a> the newcomers program, one teacher in each grade level, and two pull-out teachers.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5195.106s">So</a> it will look like, well, the Roberts has five teachers, but three of those grade levels are for newcomers.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5210.363s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5210.984s">So</a> I just put together this PowerPoint. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5213.486s">I</a> actually did it for my department and thought you might find this interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5217.569s">So</a> this is on a federal level. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5222.353s">There</a> are almost 5 million English learners. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5225.015s">This</a> is from data from 2014 to 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5228.318s">But</a> English learners are the fastest growing population of students in grades K through 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5234.902s">Nationwide,</a> about 10% of the population are English learners. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5241.788s">So</a> then this is what it looks like on the state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5244.77s">So</a> the graph on the top shows the total number of students in K to 12 schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5250.314s">And</a> you see it was going up from 2012, and it peaked in 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5255.038s">And</a> something happened in 2016 where the overall numbers just dropped for total enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5263.625s">in</a> public schools, so I'm guessing baby boom years or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5268.191s">And</a> now it's on a steady, now it's going up from 2016, it's on the rise again. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5273.898s">But</a> if you look at the percentage, the graph on the left, the percentage of English learners in Massachusetts public schools, <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5281.102s">The</a> line has steadily been going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5283.762s">So</a> Medford is reflective of what's happening in the country at large in terms of being the fastest growing population of students, school-age students in public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5296.285s">Across</a> the state, we have about 100,000 English learners. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5302.026s">And</a> then here's Medford's data. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5305.686s">So</a> we have about 11%. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5307.347s">We're</a> a little bit higher than the state average. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5310.87s">as</a> well as the federal average. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5314.931s">So</a> as of this, which was I think October, we had 456 students currently receiving English learner services, in addition to 235 students who are what we call fell students. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5327.094s">These</a> are former English learner students. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5330.355s">After</a> a student is exited from an English learner program, we monitor them for a four-year period, just to make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5338.783s">nothing's</a> come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5340.766s">With</a> our younger students who are learning to read, you know, sometimes it's like, oh, yeah, they're proficient, and the data shows it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5347.494s">The</a> access test shows it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5348.655s">Their</a> class, you know, their classwork shows it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5351.038s">We</a> might find out, oh, no, they still need some support, so we can bring them back into the fold. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5359.729s">And</a> then this, again, talking about trying to hit moving targets in terms of trying to figure out what our numbers are and where they're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5369.458s">And</a> there's a lot going on on this slide, so I'll try to explain it best. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5373.602s">But</a> obviously, we have it broken down by elementary, middle, and high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5377.225s">I'm</a> just going to focus on the total ELs in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5380.988s">But</a> I use October as my... <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5385.585s">moment</a> in time, because that's when we submit our October SIMS. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5389.867s">So</a> the first band, the dark orange color, was October 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5395.51s">And</a> we had 403 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5400.553s">That's</a> what we started the year with last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5403.495s">By</a> June, we had 487 English learners. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5407.457s">So</a> that was our increase from October. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5410.659s">Say</a> that again.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5412.099s">We</a> had 487.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5415.975s">403.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5415.995s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5417.596s">So</a> we're constantly testing students throughout the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5421.799s">We're</a> constantly adding students. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5423.86s">Our</a> numbers are growing. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5425.661s">So</a> that was our number in June was 487. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5428.644s">Now</a> through, you know, at the high school, obviously 12th grade students when they leave, any students that we reclassify as a FAL, a former English learner, they come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5438.511s">Even</a> though we're still monitoring them, they're not actively receiving the EL services. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5443.594s">So</a> then the following October, we started the year with 456 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5449.319s">So</a> if I use that October moment in time as my gauge, we're increasing about 20% each year.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5482.852s">The</a> overall population? <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5485.554s">I</a> haven't been collecting that data.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5499.881s">I</a> haven't looked at total numbers, so I can't comment on that.<h2><a href="../2018-09-13_HY2bBQvmkEQ/2018-09-13_HY2bBQvmkEQ.html">Medford School Committee meeting September 6, 2018</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8452.34s">Yeah,</a> so students got to, so Starbase is a series of STEM labs at Air Force bases throughout the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8461.248s">I</a> think there are four of them and we have one here at Hanscom. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8465.472s">So</a> the students get to go out for a week and they <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8470.476s">engage</a> in the whole engineering design process. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8474.937s">They</a> get to build pieces of the space station with a 3D laser printer. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8481.518s">And</a> each student gets a different part. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8483.639s">They</a> actually do reconstruct it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8486.639s">They</a> have CO2 car races that they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8490.16s">There's</a> chemistry. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8491.58s">There's</a> all sorts of hands-on activities, focusing all on <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8499.222s">you</a> know, science and STEM activities.<h2><a href="../2018-05-23_OW5zlwQpW0s/2018-05-23_OW5zlwQpW0s.html">Medford School Committee Meeting May 21, 2018</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5249.733s">Hi,</a> good evening everyone.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5394.894s">Oh,</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5399.029s">And</a> that was the model that the Department of Ed wanted six years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5405.071s">But</a> now that's changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5407.352s">And</a> that's come out of retail for the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5412.233s">Also,</a> when this went into effect in the middle schools, <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5417.958s">the</a> numbers were a lot smaller, so it was easier for all of our middle school students to get what they needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5425.302s">As</a> the numbers have continually grown, and with the changes in the regs, this model no longer works, and that's what they'd like to see change. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5437.257s">probably</a> the beginning of April, we started the McGlynn EL redesign program, which involved McGlynn middle school teachers and the McGlynn administration on looking at ways to <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5453.094s">redo</a> the schedule to have our students be at grade level and still get all of the classes that they need to support their English language development and the content at grade level with their grade level peers, moving away from that school within a school model. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5469.967s">We're</a> at about 80% finished. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5472.449s">I'm</a> sure you'll be getting a report on that, on what that will look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5476.339s">We</a> actually met today after school. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5478.94s">There's</a> about 15 people on the team putting this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5485.343s">So</a> with those changes is why when I go down, well, I guess let me finish the highlights before I go to money. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5495.487s">So</a> we offered some pre-K through 12 professional development. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5503.302s">We</a> tied into the union contract with providing teachers with 15 PDPs that could be used for salary credit, and the focus on that was working with English learners. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5517.03s">And</a> that was on Saturdays at the McGlynn with a combination of face-to-face and online sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5525.276s">We</a> also offered some PD on working with students from Haiti. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5530.897s">And</a> actually, Mr. Rousseau was in attendance at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5534.959s">I</a> think there were about 35 teachers that came to the McGlynn on a Saturday to be a part of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5540.82s">We</a> also offered professional development for our pre-K teachers, which even though we don't necessarily have an EL pre-K program, <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5549.013s">Our</a> pre-K teachers do work with English learners, and so we provided professional development for pre-K teachers, which also gave them the opportunity to get their 15 PDPs for license renewal and just also kind of learn about the process of working with English learners. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5567.603s">One</a> of the things instituted this year were grade level English language development progress reports, so every student in the district got a progress report that broke down the four domains of language, reading, writing, listening, and speaking, and you can actually track the student's progress throughout the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5589.814s">We</a> did the fall and spring common writing prompts. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5592.637s">So</a> we did that across grade level in every school. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5596.74s">We're</a> using, the teachers are actually finishing up the spring prompts now. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5600.804s">We're</a> using that as part of data collection to monitor student progress and also identify areas of need to help us group students better and support them with what they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5614.608s">We</a> have a partnership with Starbase STEM Labs at Hanscom Air Force Base for a summer program. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5621.956s">It's</a> a one-week STEM program at the Air Force Base. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5625.901s">They</a> have this incredible STEM lab where students get to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5631.287s">It's</a> only available for fifth grade students. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5634.911s">They</a> get to go to the lab. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5637.872s">They</a> get robotics. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5639.052s">They</a> get to work with 3D printers. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5641.773s">There's</a> the engineering design process. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5644.674s">Every</a> day is a different topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5647.035s">And</a> that will be offered as a summer program for the one, a summer camp basically for the one week. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5653.536s">It</a> is free, but I can use Title III to pay for the transportation costs to get the students out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5660.703s">We're</a> starting an English learner parent advisory council, although I may change the name on that because I was at a conference on Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5666.706s">I</a> always struggle with parent advisory council because many of our students, especially our English learners, may not be here with their parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5674.869s">So</a> I might take the parent piece out and maybe call it a district council and call it LDAC. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5682.574s">So</a> that is part of what came out of the look bill in November 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5686.598s">All</a> districts who have more than 100 English learners or 5% of the population need to have this LPAC. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5696.046s">And</a> so the first meeting is to just inform parents about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5701.05s">And</a> I believe that is set for the second week in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5704.533s">I</a> don't know the exact date off the top of my head. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5708.15s">And</a> then we started a student translation community service program at Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5714.559s">This</a> allows students at the high school to act as translators for public events, not report card conferences or anything confidential. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5725.473s">The</a> students, high school students, went down to the elementary schools for their open houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5730.859s">They</a> went to the family math nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5733.502s">And</a> this is also a program, we give the students community service hours for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5738.287s">And</a> we're actually tying that into the seal of biliteracy because English learners are entitled to earn the seal of biliteracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5746.035s">So,</a> you know, our second largest language group is Haitian Creole, but there aren't tests for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5751.859s">So</a> the Department of Education is actually coming up with alternative criteria to allow students who can't take that online test to be able to earn the seal, and this is one way that we can fold that into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5766.762s">We've</a> established language acquisition teams in every building, and we're doing this for our end-of-the-year placement meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5774.506s">So</a> we're taking, like, the writing data, MCAS scores, you know, the history of MCAS, if available, when the students access scores, which won't be released until May 30th now, and then all of their internal measures, the DRAs that they, the DRA scores that they get are found to some, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5796.516s">And</a> we're going to look at the whole student to make placement decisions, especially if we're exiting a student from the program or if we're moving somebody from newcomers to EL pullout. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5808.7s">We're</a> establishing protocols to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5810.8s">Again,</a> that's consistent, you know, throughout the district and we're looking at multiple data points to make that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5816.526s">We</a> did have 100% participation in the access testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5820.549s">I</a> also worked with principals and lead teachers in the buildings to decrease the number of days that the students were tested. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5829.255s">And</a> we did actually decrease the testing time so we could get back to actual teaching. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5836.76s">We</a> streamlined the EL testing procedures and parent guardian notification at the Parent Information Center, and then also when the <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5844.605s">access</a> scores come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5846.047s">We're</a> not waiting until summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5847.549s">We're</a> going to get that all taken care of before the students leave in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5853.002s">And</a> then there was a life after high school program at Medford High School run by Ami Sanye, one of the EL teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5861.264s">She</a> had speakers come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5863.085s">She</a> worked with the librarian to secure the space and set it all up for students to look at their options after high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5873.188s">And</a> it wasn't just for seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5874.868s">But</a> it used to be done during the summer, but we moved it up to April so she could get the seniors, because waiting until the summer would preclude them from being a part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5884.235s">So</a> those were our highlights. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5886.757s">So</a> the funding for 2017-18, the textbook budget, a big chunk of it went to the EL Intro to Physics course, which was a new course last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5901.166s">We</a> do our summer testing and registration of L's. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5903.948s">That's</a> probably our busiest time of summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5908.152s">And</a> then instructional materials office supply for the Yale program K through 12, and then the translation budget, which it's my understanding that was also increased last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5918.075s">So</a> the funding request for 18-19, so we can level fund for the summer labor, for the translations, office supplies, and instructional materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5928.237s">Where</a> I'm hoping to have an increase is on the textbook budget from $4,000 to $7,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5933.178s">Again,</a> I'm trying to streamline what's going on in the district across grade levels and also even within schools at the same level. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5944.6s">We</a> have a lot of teacher-created materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5947.882s">The</a> Yale curriculum that was left by my predecessor is amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5954.865s">It</a> really is streamlined. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5957.105s">It</a> allowed the teachers to bring in a lot of their own materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5961.147s">The</a> struggle with it is <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5964.195s">It's</a> not, we don't have a consistent foundation. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5967.859s">So</a> we can have two EL1 classes at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5971.443s">And</a> now at the McGlynn, with the redesign, we're going to have three EL1 classrooms because there'll be grade level. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5978.35s">Three,</a> you know, EL2 classrooms by grade level. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5982.214s">And</a> so we need a consistent measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5984.576s">And</a> so we need a foundation, which would be the textbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5987.639s">not</a> to replace the curriculum, because the curriculum is still the heart of what we do, but we need a common teaching and assessment tool across the board, and so that's why I'm asking for the additional funding for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6002.013s">We've</a> identified the textbook series that we'll be using. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6004.516s">It's</a> in the packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6005.717s">For</a> the middle school, it's National Geographics Inside, and for the high school, it's National Geographic Edge. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6011.708s">And</a> they actually do, it's the same format and structure, so it does go up basically from middle school to high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6023.871s">And</a> then for the positions, I'm asking for an additional middle school teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6028.454s">And</a> that was actually something that they did ask for in the budget last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6031.856s">And</a> it ended up, I think, going to the high school because of that need. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6037.759s">As</a> you know, our numbers are fluid. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6039.76s">I</a> think I put in here we're 40 students above what we had last year, which is basically an entire class. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6049.346s">And</a> then that teacher is needed because now once we split the students, they're no longer by language proficiency level, they're now by grade level. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6058.998s">And</a> in order to give the students everything we need to give them, especially our newcomer students, we're going to need the extra teacher to make that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6070.197s">And</a> then we had a long-term sub at the high school asking that that position be converted into a full-time position rather than paying a substitute teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6081.307s">There</a> were issues with certification, which won't be a problem next year, and that's why she was a sub and paid at the sub rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6092.315s">But</a> that will be a full-fledged teacher next year, and that's the Intro to Physics course.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6144.493s">So</a> when I ran those statistics, the McGlynn is at 11.6% of an EL population, which is just slightly higher than 10%, which is kind of, I don't want to say a norm, because every district is different. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6159.516s">But</a> to be in that 10% range is perfectly acceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6166.195s">One</a> of the advantages of the redesign is that the students are kind of clustered together now, so it seems like a bigger program at the MacLenn than it really is, because they essentially travel as a group, and that goes for their UA classes, it goes for their <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6186.79s">even</a> their content classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6188.692s">So</a> we're distributing the students, and they're all just on one team. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6193.197s">So</a> now, with this new design, we're putting them on two teams. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6197.542s">They're</a> on the A team and the B team, so the students will be more absorbed into the general school population. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6206.271s">In</a> terms of putting a program at the Andrews, I could do that, and I know space is an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6211.816s">But</a> then, now once I put, and this came up in the Department of Ed's CPR, I asked, you know, we have two middle schools, we have a program only in one, are we in compliance? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6223.707s">And</a> she said, yes, that's not a compliance issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6227.591s">But</a> if we do move a program over to the Andrews, <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6230.714s">the</a> program at the Andrews needs to look the same way as it does at the McGlynn, because then it becomes an inequity issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6238.418s">So</a> I can put a program at the Andrews, but that will require four teachers.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6258.386s">No,</a> because then it would, so the, within the school, so, and, and if anyone from the McGlynn is watching this, this isn't set in stone, but one team would have the, um, the newcomer strand of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6271.741s">So</a> that would be the A team. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6273.423s">The</a> B team would have the level three, four, and five students. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6277.707s">So</a> if I took the newcomer program over and put it at the Andrews, say that A-team, which I think that was in the proposal that I gave you back in October, I could move that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6287.85s">That</a> would require three teachers to go over to the... <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6293.237s">to</a> go over to the Andrews, and two, to remain at the McGlynn to have the three, fours, and fives. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6302.943s">We</a> can just keep the newcomer program in one of the buildings, but as those newcomer students become fluent and become grade level and go from being a newcomer to a level three, four, well then they need an EL teacher as well, and that's where the equity is. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6319.993s">So</a> that would be, <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6321.994s">additional</a> teaching, you know, in year two, year three.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6335.21s">That</a> is not a desired <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6338.873s">scenario</a> for any of our students, because the idea, excuse me?
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6345.339s">Well,</a> there are other teachers, but it's also, it's challenging for any student to move around. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6351.384s">You</a> know, you're with your friends, you're with your peer group. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6353.346s">Okay,</a> now we're moving you this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6355.128s">Oh,</a> next year you're moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6356.509s">So,</a> if it were a student who, say, came in at the end of fifth grade, who was a newcomer. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6362.494s">So,</a> you know, they're at the Roberts, and everybody does, <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6365.697s">move.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6366.518s">So</a> then they go to the Andrews for one year, and then we're sending them to the McGlynn for another year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6371.964s">And</a> that's not an ideal situation for any student. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6375.147s">And</a> that's a struggle that I'm having with the Brooks program being separated, because we could conceivably have a second grade student come in halfway through the year, so they're in the newcomer program. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6388.108s">Now</a> they still need newcomer in September, so we transfer them to the Brooks, I mean to the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6394.171s">So</a> then they finish their newcomer program, but their neighborhood school is the Columbus. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6398.653s">And</a> in a two and a half year period, we have moved that student to three different schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6403.376s">And</a> that's not really what's in the best interest of the student. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6406.217s">And</a> so I'd hate to do that at the middle school level.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6446.025s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6447.006s">The</a> teachers were actually working on putting the schedules together today. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6450.509s">I</a> see.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6455.453s">Hang</a> on for a moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6457.094s">I</a> don't have the number broken down by newcomers. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6459.637s">And</a> a lot of this will be driven by those lab meetings that we have at the end of the year, because that's when we make the decision if a student is still classified as a newcomer, if they're going on to level three, or if they're being reclassified as a fellow. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6473.348s">I</a> wouldn't be able to give you those numbers, but after we, so the lab meetings are the first week in June because, or first into the second week of June because the access scores, which are a major component of that, like I said, don't come up until May 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6488.916s">Once</a> we have that, I'll have a clear picture of every student currently in the district and where they're going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6493.779s">Okay,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6518.789s">No,</a> they don't.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6530.095s">I'll,</a> again, I'll know. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6531.417s">Like</a> last year, I don't know, because those decisions were all made before I came on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6537.063s">But</a> they did, the state came out with new exit criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6542.208s">And</a> so there were students, even over the summer, that did, you know, I know of three students that did change schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6549.396s">And</a> sometimes it's just for one year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6552.399s">which</a> is problematic because you've had the student that's been, you know, has only known the Roberts and then in that final year is going to another school where they don't necessarily have a peer group that they grew up with.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6713.053s">So</a> one of the things that I could do this year, because I don't know what the official district policy is, but when we have our lab meetings, if we're recommending that a student no longer needs newcomers, I can create a form to go home to the parents that's translated, giving them the option to either stay at the Roberts or to <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6738.377s">go</a> to their neighborhood school, because ultimately, the parents need to make the decision that works best for, or the guardians need to make the decision that works best for the family. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6747.863s">But</a> there's been no official policy that I know of on one side of this or the other.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6781.848s">I'm</a> asking for a fifth.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6787.478s">They</a> all teach newcomers, and they teach all levels, because the program at the McGlynn Middle School is one that the students are grouped by language proficiency, not by grade level. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6801.149s">So</a> a classroom at the McGlynn right now could have level one students, but you have students who are grade six, seven, and eight in one classroom.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6820.623s">One</a> teacher can't do newcomers because of, see, it's not just one. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6825.286s">So</a> the state dictates how many periods of ESL the teacher, I mean, the students need. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6832.83s">So</a> newcomers are a minimum of two. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6836.545s">recommended</a> three periods of English language development daily. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6840.731s">So</a> one teacher couldn't teach nine classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6843.996s">There's</a> just not enough periods in the day to handle all the newcomers. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6847.821s">And</a> that's just the newcomers. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6849.323s">You</a> have the level twos that also <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6852.097s">get</a> two periods a day on minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6854.818s">Threes</a> get one or two, depending upon where they fall on the range. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6859.221s">Fours</a> get one period. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6860.821s">And</a> then we also have the support. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6862.863s">And</a> we also have what we call former English learners, FELs. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6867.865s">Sorry,</a> I don't make these acronyms. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6870.747s">And</a> those students are monitored. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6872.588s">And</a> then if they need support, they're brought back into the fold to get the support.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6894.724s">If</a> we did newcomers in both buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6897.827s">If</a> we did newcomers just in one of the buildings, which would be permissible, that would be four in one building, and then two, a minimum of two at the other building.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7011.904s">So</a> that's an option under the Look Bill, and that would be, <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7017.253s">The</a> old model was the transitional bilingual program. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7020.616s">What's</a> permissible is a two-way bilingual program, and that's what you're describing. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7026.821s">So</a> our major languages, our two top languages are Portuguese and Haitian Creole. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7034.627s">Our</a> Spanish numbers are on the lower side. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7037.329s">We</a> wouldn't be able to support a program for Spanish.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7049.497s">Framingham</a> is the only district that I know of that does the Portuguese program. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7057.019s">And</a> there is a Cape Verdean program in, not New Bedford, but yeah.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7078.806s">Except</a> for Framingham. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7081.188s">So</a> Haitian Creole would be the only one? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7083.31s">Haitian</a> Creole would be the only one. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7084.892s">I</a> know of no Haitian Creole.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7092.247s">So</a> the state's working on those regs right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7096.168s">And</a> what would be acceptable, basically, the draft, because the draft form that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7101.53s">DeCarlo</a> was just talking about included all of these other features of the look bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7107.111s">And</a> one of them was the requirements for educators to obtain, similar to the SEI endorsement, an endorsement, a bilingual endorsement that would allow them to teach in that native language.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7128.132s">I</a> was just at a meeting on Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7129.673s">Nobody</a> gave good news, bad news. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7131.373s">I'm</a> hoping it's at least at the minimum status quo.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7152.91s">Well,</a> and that's the thing, to find the teachers who are, you know, and then to, you know, it's, that's, like, I'm excited if I can find an EL teacher who's certified in math. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7164.615s">That's</a> the uniform. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7166.876s">So</a> to find somebody who is certified in math who's also, you know, bilingual and, you know, Haitian Creole or English, you know, that's, that's going to be a tough, a tough one to find.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7204.445s">So</a> the total number of ELs are 499.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7213.327s">That's</a> district-wide.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7219.653s">The</a> 11% that I mentioned earlier, that was just the McGlynn numbers.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7285.911s">And</a> I'm also wondering, are we in compliance with the federal government's policy on the
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7307.858s">Yes,</a> because we're meeting, it's not a ratio between students and teachers, it's are we delivering service hours based on their access scores. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7321.068s">And</a> so one of the things that we did this year was I do a monthly census, maybe more like every six weeks, <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7328.014s">And</a> it goes out to all of the Yale teachers, and they have their students, they have their access scores, they indicate how many periods they're seeing them for because there are exceptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7338.878s">When</a> we have duly identified students who are getting support from special education, there's just not enough hours in the day for some students to get all the services, and the department recognizes that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7352.188s">you</a> know, as long as we're, you know, honoring the spirit of the required hours, we're in compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7357.975s">So</a> we're in good shape there.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7373.802s">So</a> the curriculum directors have all been managing that for their departments, so they know if they have a teacher who needs to get the endorsement, and they're dealing with that within their department level.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7393.017s">With</a> re-licensure, definitely. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7395.119s">And</a> again, anything to do with licensing, as I tell teachers, that's your agreement between you and the state of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7403.285s">We</a> just have to make sure that you're credentialed to do what we're asking you to do.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7437.617s">So</a> one of the things that we've talked about in the EL redesign committee is, you know, if the numbers continue to grow, you know, we would have to move the program over to the Andrews because then we would be repeating the issue that exists there now. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7452.73s">Right</a> now, once we spread them between the two teams, <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7456.569s">It's</a> now taking some pressure off. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7458.63s">But</a> as the numbers grow, even between the two teams, so we would need to look at the program with the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7464.892s">And</a> so, you know, it would be one teacher this year, and then next year, you know, if we do it in increments. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7471.934s">As</a> the incoming superintendent proposed her upper school, lower middle school, upper middle school plan, that would alleviate a lot of these problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7482.702s">And</a> one of the things that the McGlynn teachers are excited about is, because there is a lot of change on the horizon, that whatever plan we create as the EL redesign team will work in almost any scenario. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7496.308s">So</a> they're very happy about that.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7520.692s">So</a> the way I set up the team was, the email went out through Nick Tucci after he was appointed, asking for representatives from each grade-level team. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7531.18s">So</a> a representative from the A team, the B team. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7533.955s">for</a> every grade level, special education, guidance, administration, EL, the UA teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7540.697s">So</a> that's why it's such a big group, because everybody's involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7545.498s">Their</a> task between every meeting is to go back to their team, whether it's their grade level team or their department team, and share. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7552.5s">And</a> we start every new session with getting feedback from the rest of the teachers.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7561.187s">They're</a> excited about the change, and this has been coming for a while, and they're glad to be a part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7570.551s">I</a> didn't bring any of my posters. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7571.892s">Like</a> I said, we just did this today. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7574.333s">But</a> they're glad the dialogue is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7576.894s">They're</a> glad that they have a voice in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7580.056s">So</a> they're excited about the programs being built.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7600.642s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2018-05-22_ACxsV5H4ehA/2018-05-22_ACxsV5H4ehA.html">School Committee Meeting 05/21/18</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5249.89s">Good</a> evening, everyone.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5398.995s">And</a> that was the model that the Department of Ed wanted six years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5405.037s">But</a> now that's changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5407.318s">And</a> that's come out of retail for the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5412.22s">Also,</a> when this went into effect in the middle schools, <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5417.942s">the</a> numbers were a lot smaller. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5419.623s">So</a> it was easier for all of our middle school students to get what they needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5425.288s">As</a> the numbers have continually grown and with the changes in the regs, this model no longer works. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5431.413s">And</a> that's what they'd like to see change. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5434.176s">Back</a> in probably the beginning of April, we started the McGlynn EL redesign program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5444.283s">which</a> involved McGlynn Middle School teachers and the McGlynn administration on looking at ways to redo the schedule to have our students be at grade level and still get all of the classes that they need to support their English language development and the content at grade level with their grade level peers, moving away from that school within a school model. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5469.92s">We're</a> at about 80% finished. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5472.402s">I'm</a> sure you'll be getting a report on that, on what that will look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5476.306s">We</a> actually met today after school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5478.928s">There's</a> about 15 people on the team putting this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5485.313s">So</a> with those changes is why when I go down, well, I guess, let me finish the highlights before I go to Mike. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5498.0s">We</a> offered some pre-K through 12 professional development. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5501.242s">We</a> tied into the union contract with providing teachers with 15 PDPs that could be used for salary credit. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5512.031s">And</a> the focus on that was working with English learners. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5517.014s">And</a> that was on Saturdays at the McGlynn with a combination of face-to-face and online sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5525.259s">We</a> also offered some PD on working with students from Haiti, and actually Mr. Russo was in attendance at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5534.922s">I</a> think there were about 35 teachers that came to the McGlynn on a Saturday to be a part of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5540.803s">We</a> also offered professional development for our pre-K teachers, which even though we don't necessarily have an EL pre-K program, <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5548.996s">Our</a> pre-K teachers do work with English learners, and so we provided professional development for pre-K teachers, which also gave them the opportunity to get their 15 PDPs for license renewal, and just also kind of learn about the process of working with English learners. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5567.586s">One</a> of the things instituted this year were grade-level English language development progress reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5573.369s">So</a> every student in the district got a progress report that broke down the four domains of language, reading, writing, listening, and speaking, and you can actually track the student's progress throughout the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5589.78s">We</a> did the fall and spring common writing prompts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5592.621s">So</a> we did that across grade level in every school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5596.722s">We're</a> using, the teachers are actually finishing up the spring prompts now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5600.762s">We're</a> using that as part of data collection to monitor student progress and also identify areas of need to help us group students better and support them with what they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5614.591s">We</a> have a partnership with Starbase STEM Labs at Hanscom Air Force Base for a summer program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5621.939s">It's</a> a one-week STEM program at the Air Force Base. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5625.884s">They</a> have this incredible STEM lab where students get to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5631.27s">It's</a> only available for fifth grade students. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5634.874s">They</a> get to go to the lab. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5637.855s">They</a> get robotics. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5639.035s">They</a> get to work with 3D printers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5641.756s">There's</a> the engineering design process. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5644.657s">Every</a> day is a different topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5646.998s">And</a> that will be offered as a summer program for the one, a summer camp basically for the one week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5653.499s">It</a> is free, but I can use Title III to pay for the transportation costs to get the students out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5660.667s">We're</a> starting an English learner parent advisory council, although I may change the name on that because I was at a conference on Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5666.669s">I</a> always struggle with parent advisory council because many of our students, especially our English learners, may not be here with their parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5674.852s">So</a> I might take the parent piece out and maybe call it a district council and call it LDAC. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5682.554s">So</a> that is part of what came out of the look bill in November 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5686.575s">All</a> districts who have more than 100 English learners or 5% of the population need to have this LPAC. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5696.018s">And</a> so the first meeting is to just inform parents about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5701.019s">And</a> I believe that is set for the second week in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5704.48s">I</a> don't know the exact date off the top of my head. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5708.135s">And</a> then we started a student translation community service program at Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5714.518s">This</a> allows students at the high school to act as translators for public events, not report card conferences or anything confidential. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5725.443s">The</a> students, high school students, went down to the elementary schools for their open houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5730.827s">They</a> went to the family math nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5733.469s">And</a> this is also a program, we give the students community service hours for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5738.272s">And</a> we're actually tying that into the seal of biliteracy because English learners are entitled to earn the seal of biliteracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5745.998s">So,</a> you know, our second largest language group is Haitian Creole, but there aren't tests for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5751.823s">So</a> the Department of Education is actually coming up with alternative criteria to allow students who can't take that online test to be able to earn the seal, and this is one way that we can fold that into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5766.728s">We've</a> established language acquisition teams in every building, and we're doing this for our end-of-the-year placement meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5774.469s">So</a> we're taking, like, the writing data, MCAS scores, you know, the history of MCAS, if available, when the students access scores, which won't be released until May 30th now, and then all of their internal measures, the DRAs that they, the DRA scores that they get, or Fountas and Pinnell, <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5796.493s">And</a> we're going to look at the whole student to make placement decisions, especially if we're exiting a student from the program or if we're moving somebody from newcomers to EL pullout. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5808.681s">We're</a> establishing protocols to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5810.762s">Again,</a> that's consistent, you know, throughout the district and we're looking at multiple data points to make that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5816.509s">We</a> did have 100% participation in the access testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5820.512s">I</a> also worked with principals and lead teachers in the buildings to decrease the number of days that the students were tested. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5829.24s">And</a> we did actually decrease the testing time so we could get back to actual teaching. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5836.726s">We</a> streamlined the EL testing procedures and parent guardian notification at the Parent Information Center and then also when the <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5844.588s">access</a> scores come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5846.009s">We're</a> not waiting until summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5847.331s">We're</a> going to get that all taken care of before the students leave in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5852.965s">And</a> then there was a life after high school program at Medford High School run by Ami Sanye, one of the EL teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5861.251s">She</a> had speakers come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5863.072s">She</a> worked with the librarian to secure the space and set it all up for students to look at their options after high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5873.179s">And</a> it wasn't just for seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5874.84s">But</a> it used to be done during the summer, but we moved it up to April so she could get the seniors, because waiting until the summer would preclude them from being a part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5884.204s">So</a> those were our highlights. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5886.745s">So</a> the funding for 2017-18, the textbook budget, a big chunk of it went to the EL Intro to Physics course, which was a new course last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5901.129s">We</a> do our summer testing and registration of L's. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5903.911s">That's</a> probably our busiest time of summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5908.134s">And</a> then instructional materials office supply for the Yale program K through 12, and then the translation budget, which it's my understanding that was also increased last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5918.042s">So</a> the funding request for 18-19, so we can level fund for the summer labor, for the translations, office supplies, and instructional materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5928.21s">Where</a> I'm hoping to have an increase is on the textbook budget from $4,000 to $7,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5933.174s">Again,</a> I'm trying to streamline what's going on in the district across grade levels and also even within schools at the same level. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5944.583s">We</a> have a lot of teacher-created materials, <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5947.843s">The</a> Yale curriculum that was left by my predecessor is amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5954.832s">It</a> really is streamlined. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5957.094s">It</a> allowed the teachers to bring in a lot of their own materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5961.139s">The</a> struggle with it is <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5964.178s">It's</a> not, we don't have a consistent foundation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5967.842s">So</a> we can have two EL1 classes at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5971.426s">And</a> now at the McGlynn, with the redesign, we're going to have three EL1 classrooms because there'll be grade level. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5978.333s">Three,</a> you know, EL2 classrooms by grade level. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5982.197s">And</a> so we need a consistent measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5984.539s">And</a> so we need a foundation, which would be the textbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5987.622s">not</a> to replace the curriculum, because the curriculum is still the heart of what we do, but we need a common teaching and assessment tool across the board, and so that's why I'm asking for the additional funding for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6001.987s">We've</a> identified the textbook series that we'll be using. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6004.468s">It's</a> in the packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6005.688s">For</a> the middle school, it's National Geographic's Inside, and for the high school, it's National Geographic Edge. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6011.672s">And</a> they actually do, it's the same format and structure, so it does go up basically from middle school to high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6023.838s">And</a> then for the positions, I'm asking for an additional middle school teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6028.441s">And</a> that was actually something that they did ask for in the budget last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6031.844s">And</a> it ended up, I think, going to the high school because of that need. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6037.749s">As</a> you know, our numbers are fluid. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6039.83s">I</a> think I put in here we're 40 students above what we had last year, which is basically an entire class. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6049.329s">And</a> then that teacher is needed because now once we split the students, they're no longer by language proficiency level, they're now by grade level. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6058.977s">And</a> in order to give the students everything we need to give them, especially our newcomer students, we're going to need the extra teacher to make that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6070.18s">And</a> then we had a long-term sub at the high school asking that that position be converted into a full-time position rather than paying a substitute teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6081.285s">There</a> were issues with certification, which won't be a problem next year, and that's why she was a sub and paid at the sub rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6092.29s">But</a> that will be a full-fledged teacher next year, and that's the Intro to Physics course.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6144.483s">So</a> when I ran those statistics, the McGlynn is at 11.6% of the Yale population, which is just slightly higher than 10%, which is kind of, I don't want to say a norm because every district is different, but to be in that 10% range is perfectly acceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6166.178s">One</a> of the advantages of the redesign is that the students are kind of clustered together now, so it seems like a bigger program at the MacLenn than it really is, because they essentially travel as a group, and that goes for their UA classes, it goes for their <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6186.757s">even</a> their content classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6188.658s">So</a> we're distributing the students, and they're all just on one team. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6193.161s">So</a> now, with this new design, we're putting them on two teams. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6197.503s">They're</a> on the A team and the B team, so the students will be more absorbed into the general school population. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6206.247s">In</a> terms of putting a program at the Andrews, I could do that, and I know space is an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6211.79s">But</a> then, now once I put, and this came up in the Department of Ed's CPR, I asked, you know, we have two middle schools, we have a program only in one, are we in compliance? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6223.696s">And</a> she said, yes, that's not a compliance issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6227.558s">But</a> if we do move a program over to the Andrews, <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6230.7s">the</a> program at the Andrews needs to look the same way as it does at the McGlynn, because then it becomes an inequity issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6238.404s">So</a> I can put a program at the Andrews, but that will require four teachers.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6258.372s">No,</a> because then it would, so the, within the school, so, and if anyone from the McGlynn is watching this, this isn't set in stone, but one team would have the newcomer strand of students, so that would be the A team. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6273.386s">The</a> B team would have the level 3, 4, and 5 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6277.67s">So</a> if I took the newcomer program over and put it at the Andrews, say that A-team, which I think that was in the proposal that I gave you back in October, I could move that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6287.819s">That</a> would require three teachers to go over to the, <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6293.204s">to</a> go over to the Andrews and two, to remain at the McGlynn to have the three, fours and fives. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6302.93s">We</a> can just keep the newcomer program in one of the buildings, but as those newcomer students become fluent and become grade level and go from being a newcomer to a level three, four, well then they need an EL teacher as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6318.118s">And</a> that's where the equity is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6319.959s">So</a> that would be, <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6321.962s">additional</a> teaching, you know, in year two, year three.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6335.2s">That</a> is not a desired <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6338.857s">scenario</a> for any of our students because the idea excuse me well there are other teachers but it's also it's challenging for any student to move around you know you're with your friends you're with your peer group okay now we're moving you this year oh next year you're moving so <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6357.067s">If</a> it were a student who, say, came in at the end of fifth grade who was a newcomer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6362.889s">So</a> they're at the Roberts, and everybody does move. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6366.491s">So</a> then they go to the Andrews for one year, and then we're sending them to the McGlynn for another year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6371.933s">And</a> that's not an ideal situation for any student. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6375.114s">And</a> that's the struggle that I'm having with the Brooks program being separated, because we could conceivably have <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6382.517s">A</a> second grade student come in halfway through the year, so they're in the newcomer program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6388.098s">Now</a> they still need newcomer in September, so we transfer them to the Brooks, I mean to the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6394.139s">So</a> then they finish their newcomer program, but their neighborhood school is the Columbus. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6398.64s">And</a> in a two and a half year period, we have moved that student to three different schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6403.341s">And</a> that's not really what's in the best interest of the student. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6406.202s">And</a> so I'd hate to do that at the middle school level.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6445.995s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6447.156s">The</a> teachers were actually working on putting the schedules together today. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6450.858s">I</a> see.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6457.054s">I</a> don't have the number broken down by newcomers, and a lot of this will be driven by those lab meetings that we have at the end of the year, because that's when we make the decision if a student is still classified as a newcomer, if they're going on to level three, or if they're being reclassified as a FAL. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6473.324s">I</a> wouldn't be able to give you those numbers, but after we, so the lab meetings are the first week in June, because, or first into the second week of June, because the access scores, which are a major component of that, like I said, don't come up until May 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6488.893s">Once</a> we have that, I'll have a clear picture of every student currently in the district and where they're going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6493.735s">Okay,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6518.755s">No,</a> they don't.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6530.078s">I'll,</a> again, I'll know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6531.4s">Like</a> last year, I don't know because those decisions were all made before I came on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6537.046s">But</a> they did, the state came out with new exit criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6542.131s">And</a> so there were students even over the summer that did, you know, I know of three students that did change schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6549.379s">And</a> sometimes it's just for one year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6552.382s">which</a> is problematic because you've had the student that's been, you know, has only known the Roberts, and then in that final year is going to another school where they don't necessarily have a peer group that they grew up with.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6713.04s">So</a> one of the things that I could do this year, because I don't know what the official district policy is, but when we have our lab meetings, if we're recommending that a student no longer needs newcomers, I can create a form to go home to the parents that's translated, giving them the option to either stay at the Roberts or to go to their neighborhood school, because ultimately the parents <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6741.552s">need</a> to make the decision that works best for, or the guardians need to make the decision that works best for the family. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6747.836s">But</a> there's been no official policy that I know of on one side of this or the other.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6781.812s">I'm</a> asking for a fifth.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6787.444s">They</a> all teach newcomers, and they teach all levels, because the program at the McGlynn Middle School is one that the students are grouped by language proficiency, not by grade level. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6801.115s">So</a> a classroom at the McGlynn right now could have level one students, but you have students who are grade six, seven, and eight in one classroom.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6820.607s">One</a> teacher can't do newcomers because of, see, it's not just one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6825.27s">So</a> the state dictates how many periods of ESL the teacher, I mean, the students need. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6832.796s">So</a> newcomers are a minimum of two. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6836.531s">recommended</a> three periods of English language development daily. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6840.697s">So</a> one teacher couldn't teach nine classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6843.983s">There's</a> just not enough periods in the day to handle all the newcomers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6847.808s">And</a> that's just the newcomers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6849.311s">You</a> have the level twos that also <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6852.08s">get</a> two periods a day on minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6854.801s">Threes</a> get one or two, depending upon where they fall on the range. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6859.204s">Fours</a> get one period. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6860.804s">And</a> then we also have the support. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6862.826s">And</a> we also have what we call former English learners, FELs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6867.848s">Sorry,</a> I don't make these acronyms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6870.73s">And</a> those students are monitored. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6872.551s">And</a> then if they need support, they're brought back into the fold to get the support.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6894.68s">If</a> we did newcomers in both buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6897.781s">If</a> we did newcomers just in one of the buildings, which would be permissible, that would be four in one building and then two, a minimum of two at the other building.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7011.889s">So</a> that's an option under the Look Bill, and that would be, <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7017.236s">The</a> old model was the transitional bilingual program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7020.599s">What's</a> permissible is a two-way bilingual program, and that's what you're describing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7026.804s">So</a> our major languages, our two top languages are Portuguese and Haitian Creole. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7034.611s">Our</a> Spanish numbers are on the lower side. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7037.333s">We</a> wouldn't be able to support a program for Spanish.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7049.479s">Framingham</a> is the only district that I know of that does the Portuguese program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7057.001s">And</a> there is a Cape Verdean program in, not New Bedford, but, Brockton.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7078.789s">Except</a> for Framingham. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7081.151s">So</a> Haitian Creole would be the only one? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7083.273s">Haitian</a> Creole would be the only one.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7092.214s">So</a> the state's working on those regs right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7095.195s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7096.135s">And</a> what would be acceptable, basically, the draft, because the draft form that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7101.497s">DeCarlo</a> was just talking about included all of these other features of the look bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7107.099s">And</a> one of them was the requirements for educators to obtain, similar to the SEI endorsement, an endorsement, a bilingual endorsement that would allow them to teach in that native language.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7125.817s">Do</a> you have a sense of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7128.118s">I</a> was just at a meeting on Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7129.638s">Nobody</a> gave good news, bad news. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7131.358s">I'm</a> hoping it's at least at the minimum status quo.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7152.875s">Well,</a> and that's the thing, to find the teachers who are, you know, and then to, you know, it's, that's, like, I'm excited if I can find an EL teacher who's certified in math. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7164.603s">That's</a> the uniform. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7166.865s">So</a> to find somebody who is certified in math who's also, you know, bilingual and, you know, Haitian Creole or English, you know, that's, that's going to be a tough, a tough one to find.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7204.434s">So</a> the total number of ELs are 499.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7213.291s">That's</a> district-wide.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7219.636s">The</a> 11% that I mentioned earlier, that was just the McGlynn numbers.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7285.891s">And</a> I'm also wondering, are we in compliance with the federal government's guidelines on
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7307.843s">Yes,</a> because we're meeting, it's not a ratio between students and teachers, it's are we delivering service hours based on their access scores. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7321.02s">And</a> so one of the things that we did this year was I do a monthly census, maybe more like every six weeks, and it goes out to all of the EL teachers and they have their students, they have their access scores, they indicate how many periods they're seeing them for because there are exceptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7338.837s">When</a> we have duly identified students who are getting support from special education, there's just not enough hours in the day for some students to get all the services. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7349.803s">And</a> the department recognizes that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7351.564s">And</a> as long as we're honoring the spirit of the required hours, we're in compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7357.947s">So</a> we're in good shape there.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7373.788s">So</a> the curriculum directors have all been managing that for their departments so they know if they have a teacher who needs to get the endorsement and they're dealing with that within their department level.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7392.983s">With</a> re-licensure, definitely. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7395.545s">And</a> again, anything to do with licensing, as I tell teachers, that's your agreement between you and the state of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7403.349s">We</a> just have to make sure that you're credentialed to do what we're asking you to do.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7437.578s">So</a> one of the things that we've talked about in the EL redesign committee is if the numbers continue to grow, we would have to move the program over to the Andrews, because then we would be repeating the issue that exists there now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7452.71s">Right</a> now, once we spread them between the two teams, it's now taking some pressure off. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7458.635s">But</a> as the numbers grow, even between the two teams, so we would need to look at the program with the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7466.107s">would</a> be one teacher this year, and then next year, if we do it in increments. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7471.912s">As</a> the incoming superintendent proposed her lower middle school, upper middle school plan, that would alleviate a lot of these problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7482.685s">And</a> one of the things that the McGlynn teachers are excited about is, because there is a lot of change on the horizon, that whatever plan we create as the EL redesign team will work in almost any scenario. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7496.273s">So</a> they're very happy about that.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7520.637s">So</a> the way I set up the team was the email went out through Nick Tucci after he was appointed, asking for representatives from each grade-level team. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7531.143s">So</a> a representative from the A team, the B team. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7533.921s">for</a> every grade level. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7535.282s">Special</a> education, guidance, administration, EL, the UA teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7540.664s">So</a> that's why it's such a big group, because everybody's involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7545.466s">Their</a> task between every meeting is to go back to their team, whether it's their grade level team or their department team, and share. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7552.469s">And</a> we start every new session with getting feedback from the rest of the teachers.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7561.17s">They're</a> excited about the change, and this has been coming for a while, and they're glad to be a part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7570.534s">I</a> didn't bring any of my posters. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7571.875s">Like</a> I said, we just did this today. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7574.316s">But</a> they're glad the dialogue is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7576.877s">They're</a> glad that they have a voice in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7580.039s">So</a> they're excited about the programs being built.<h2><a href="../2017-12-05_XE9EudnPjZw/2017-12-05_XE9EudnPjZw.html">Medford School Committee meeting December 4, 2017</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6693.626s">Good</a> evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6696.033s">So,</a> this bill allows districts to choose what type of programming works best for their communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6704.3s">Unlike</a> the old TBE, they had it set up where it was mandatory if you had 20 or more students who spoke in a language group. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6715.988s">During</a> that time, students in their first year, it was 20% of instruction was in English, 80% was in the target language. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6724.312s">Year</a> two, it was a 50-50 split. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6726.633s">And</a> then year three, it was 20% in the native language and 80% in the target language. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6737.358s">We</a> don't know what guidance the state's going to come out with regarding this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6742.761s">We</a> have to look at licensure because all of the bilingual licenses were put on hold by DESE 15 years ago when that ended. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6752.066s">So</a> we don't know what their requirements will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6754.827s">We</a> don't know <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6757.348s">really</a> what their guidance will be with programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6760.809s">It</a> doesn't, my understanding of it as the bill is written is it doesn't have to be a full-on program as it was in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6767.591s">We</a> can now have just individual classes that can support our students who speak other languages. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6775.774s">So</a> as Mr. Belson and I were talking about this initially, we're thinking, you know, start out when we look at our language groups, Portuguese is our highest, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6785.197s">highest</a> number of speakers at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6788.938s">Our</a> high school students are at a disadvantage because they have a finite period of time in which to learn language, pass all of their MCAS tests. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6796.079s">So</a> if we were to introduce something here in Medford, we would look at those protocol, the protocol set out by the Department of Ed, look at our student population, which again, changes on a regular basis, and make those decisions at that time.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6878.321s">Well,</a> when the students come here who don't speak English, they're set up with special, with their classes that are with an ESL teacher or a duly certified teacher who is certified in the content as well as ESL. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6893.146s">And</a> those are our newcomer classrooms even here at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6897.087s">The</a> teachers in collaboration with the building, with the assistant principals and guidance kind of have an informal protocol to set up students with other students, but it's not formalized, it's not a specific program. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6912.356s">But</a> the actual classes, the students are with all newcomers in these newcomer classrooms.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6965.721s">And</a> like I said, that's done informally. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6967.542s">There's</a> not a formal protocol or process for that, but the teachers work in collaboration with the guidance department on that.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6985.098s">I</a> would wait until guidance comes out. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6987.139s">I'm</a> actually going to a state meeting this Friday that will give me some additional information, and maybe I'll have a timeline on when the state will come out with their guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6999.363s">But</a> I wouldn't move forward with anything until the guidance came forth.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7017.752s">Well</a> those levels are based on what we do as a screener test when the students arrive it's based on <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7025.393s">WIDA</a> testing, we're using the WIDA screener, and that gives us the level. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7031.756s">So</a> students may have had English in their native country, which is why they would test as a level two, but they're still a newcomer, just arrival. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7040.16s">Other</a> students that are level one most likely didn't have English in their native country.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7064.354s">I'd</a> have to, I mean, are you looking for something specific or?
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7078.025s">I</a> know that the Parent Information Center has been struggling with trying to do the placement that best meets both children, and in some cases that hasn't actually happened.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7162.23s">It's</a> intense, it's a 40 hour course.
 <p>[Paul Teixeira]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7172.455s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7173.396s">And</a> it's only certain providers can give it because this was governed under the Department of Justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7180.422s">So</a> like Medford can't just offer their own training and say, okay, you're retail endorsed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7186.668s">It</a> has to be through one of the state providers because the Department of Justice is still overseeing it.<h2><a href="../2017-12-04_eOruUd5h8M4/2017-12-04_eOruUd5h8M4.html">Medford, MA School Committee - Dec. 4, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
