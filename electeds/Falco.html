    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=739.509s">[Falco]</a>: Councilor Falco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=740.389s">[Falco]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=741.17s">[Falco]</a>: I was also contacted by Bonnie as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=743.411s">[Falco]</a>: And I thank my colleagues for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=746.073s">[Falco]</a>: Um, this is a very important issue and we should always be encouraging people to take public transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=751.476s">[Falco]</a>: And I think that this, um, doing this, I think does encourage people to, um, to, to, uh, look at, uh, taking the bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=759.461s">[Falco]</a>: I, myself, I've been taking the 325 for probably close to 20 years now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=763.683s">[Falco]</a>: And, uh, I've been taking the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=766.082s">[Falco]</a>: for a long time, and I don't get on at that stop, but I do have friends that actually get on the bus at that stop, and I had talked to many of them today that they do get on at that location, and it is a concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=780.054s">[Falco]</a>: That can be a very dangerous stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=781.495s">[Falco]</a>: It's right at the rotary and an off ramp, and especially during the inclement weather, traffic can be pretty erratic on a good day, but I think on a bad day,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=793.123s">[Falco]</a>: it gets even worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=793.843s">[Falco]</a>: So I think some sort of a bus shelter in that area would benefit everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=797.445s">[Falco]</a>: So I definitely support this resolution, and I thank my colleagues for bringing it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=802.627s">[Falco]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1634.428s">[Falco]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1636.249s">[Falco]</a>: Councilor Falco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1637.229s">[Falco]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1640.33s">[Falco]</a>: As many of you know, I've been on board with municipal aggregation since day one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1645.051s">[Falco]</a>: I think it's a good, in my eyes, I think it's a good<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1648.021s">[Falco]</a>: a good plan, I think it's a good program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1650.722s">[Falco]</a>: And I, I too think that, you know, we're at the point now where, you know, I think we've heard from, you know, you know, at the last meeting we heard from someone from the energy department in Melrose just to get a different perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1663.107s">[Falco]</a>: And I think, I thought that was a very good presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1664.948s">[Falco]</a>: She did a great job and it was good to see how another city handled the communication and how they worked through the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1670.71s">[Falco]</a>: And she had all kinds of samples of communications that they sent out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1674.589s">[Falco]</a>: But I, in fact, I also agree with the Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1677.573s">[Falco]</a>: I think we need to take a vote on this to see where we're going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1682.318s">[Falco]</a>: You know, I mean, I would, I guess I feel the same way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1686.342s">[Falco]</a>: I mean, I don't want to put resources working on something that might not even pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1689.826s">[Falco]</a>: So, you know, I think, you know, it's time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1692.742s">[Falco]</a>: This has been, I think municipal aggregation has been with us for over a year now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1696.563s">[Falco]</a>: We've had many meetings, Committee of the Wholes, we've taken one vote, it went down, and it's come back, but I think we need to take a vote on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1705.207s">[Falco]</a>: And I know, I think the paper is still in committee, or actually it's in Committee of the Wholes, so I think we probably need to vote that out at some point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1712.489s">[Falco]</a>: But I think that, in my opinion, I really don't, I think a lot of our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1720.322s">[Falco]</a>: departments to stretch with regard to resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1722.482s">[Falco]</a>: And I would, I really don't, um, like the fact that we're going to put a resource towards building this list if this might not even pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1730.804s">[Falco]</a>: So, um, I, I, uh, agree with my colleague, uh, councilor Knight on this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1735.665s">[Falco]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4484.904s">[Falco]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4486.064s">[Falco]</a>: I also want to go on the record of supporting this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4488.925s">[Falco]</a>: Um, I take a look at the Brooks Estate and I take a look at the, uh, the money that, um, I mean, I look at it as,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4496.454s">[Falco]</a>: If we appropriate this money tonight, to me, to me, this is an investment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4499.596s">[Falco]</a>: It's an investment in the Brooks estate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4501.838s">[Falco]</a>: It's an investment in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4503.219s">[Falco]</a>: I mean, there are other cities and towns that would really love to have a property like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4507.923s">[Falco]</a>: Uh, like council and I said, 50 acres of, uh, open space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4511.666s">[Falco]</a>: I think it's a great opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4513.487s">[Falco]</a>: Um, and I think that's something that we need to look at, but I think we need to, I think we need to embrace this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4517.61s">[Falco]</a>: I mean, I think that this is a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4519.414s">[Falco]</a>: This is a historical site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4521.255s">[Falco]</a>: I think there's a lot of opportunity here, the potential to actually bring in revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4525.818s">[Falco]</a>: So this is something that I do support as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4528.94s">[Falco]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>
