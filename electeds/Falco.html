    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=739.509s">[Falco]</a>: Councilor Falco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=740.389s">[Falco]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=741.17s">[Falco]</a>: I was also contacted by Bonnie as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=743.411s">[Falco]</a>: And I thank my colleagues for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=746.073s">[Falco]</a>: Um, this is a very important issue and we should always be encouraging people to take public transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=751.476s">[Falco]</a>: And I think that this, um, doing this, I think does encourage people to, um, to, to, uh, look at, uh, taking the bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=759.461s">[Falco]</a>: I, myself, I've been taking the 325 for probably close to 20 years now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=763.683s">[Falco]</a>: And, uh, I've been taking the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=766.082s">[Falco]</a>: for a long time, and I don't get on at that stop, but I do have friends that actually get on the bus at that stop, and I had talked to many of them today that they do get on at that location, and it is a concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=780.054s">[Falco]</a>: That can be a very dangerous stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=781.495s">[Falco]</a>: It's right at the rotary and an off ramp, and especially during the inclement weather, traffic can be pretty erratic on a good day, but I think on a bad day,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=793.123s">[Falco]</a>: it gets even worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=793.843s">[Falco]</a>: So I think some sort of a bus shelter in that area would benefit everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=797.445s">[Falco]</a>: So I definitely support this resolution, and I thank my colleagues for bringing it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=802.627s">[Falco]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1634.428s">[Falco]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1636.249s">[Falco]</a>: Councilor Falco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1637.229s">[Falco]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1640.33s">[Falco]</a>: As many of you know, I've been on board with municipal aggregation since day one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1645.051s">[Falco]</a>: I think it's a good, in my eyes, I think it's a good<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1648.021s">[Falco]</a>: a good plan, I think it's a good program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1650.722s">[Falco]</a>: And I, I too think that, you know, we're at the point now where, you know, I think we've heard from, you know, you know, at the last meeting we heard from someone from the energy department in Melrose just to get a different perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1663.107s">[Falco]</a>: And I think, I thought that was a very good presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1664.948s">[Falco]</a>: She did a great job and it was good to see how another city handled the communication and how they worked through the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1670.71s">[Falco]</a>: And she had all kinds of samples of communications that they sent out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1674.589s">[Falco]</a>: But I, in fact, I also agree with the Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1677.573s">[Falco]</a>: I think we need to take a vote on this to see where we're going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1682.318s">[Falco]</a>: You know, I mean, I would, I guess I feel the same way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1686.342s">[Falco]</a>: I mean, I don't want to put resources working on something that might not even pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1689.826s">[Falco]</a>: So, you know, I think, you know, it's time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1692.742s">[Falco]</a>: This has been, I think municipal aggregation has been with us for over a year now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1696.563s">[Falco]</a>: We've had many meetings, Committee of the Wholes, we've taken one vote, it went down, and it's come back, but I think we need to take a vote on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1705.207s">[Falco]</a>: And I know, I think the paper is still in committee, or actually it's in Committee of the Wholes, so I think we probably need to vote that out at some point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1712.489s">[Falco]</a>: But I think that, in my opinion, I really don't, I think a lot of our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1720.322s">[Falco]</a>: departments to stretch with regard to resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1722.482s">[Falco]</a>: And I would, I really don't, um, like the fact that we're going to put a resource towards building this list if this might not even pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1730.804s">[Falco]</a>: So, um, I, I, uh, agree with my colleague, uh, councilor Knight on this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1735.665s">[Falco]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4484.904s">[Falco]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4486.064s">[Falco]</a>: I also want to go on the record of supporting this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4488.925s">[Falco]</a>: Um, I take a look at the Brooks Estate and I take a look at the, uh, the money that, um, I mean, I look at it as,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4496.454s">[Falco]</a>: If we appropriate this money tonight, to me, to me, this is an investment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4499.596s">[Falco]</a>: It's an investment in the Brooks estate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4501.838s">[Falco]</a>: It's an investment in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4503.219s">[Falco]</a>: I mean, there are other cities and towns that would really love to have a property like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4507.923s">[Falco]</a>: Uh, like council and I said, 50 acres of, uh, open space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4511.666s">[Falco]</a>: I think it's a great opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4513.487s">[Falco]</a>: Um, and I think that's something that we need to look at, but I think we need to, I think we need to embrace this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4517.61s">[Falco]</a>: I mean, I think that this is a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4519.414s">[Falco]</a>: This is a historical site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4521.255s">[Falco]</a>: I think there's a lot of opportunity here, the potential to actually bring in revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4525.818s">[Falco]</a>: So this is something that I do support as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4528.94s">[Falco]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=415.103s">[Falco]</a>: Councilor Falco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=416.024s">[Falco]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=416.844s">[Falco]</a>: I want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this forward tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=419.884s">[Falco]</a>: This is an important issue, but if I could also amend the resolution to make sure that we inspect all the park equipment in our top lots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=428.562s">[Falco]</a>: and all the play structures, just to make sure everything's safe, especially after the winter and the cold weather when things rust and things crack and break and whatnot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=435.744s">[Falco]</a>: So if we could have those inspected as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=438.164s">[Falco]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=621.651s">[Falco]</a>: Yes I do, Mr. President, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=623.852s">[Falco]</a>: We had a subcommittee on zoning on February 6th, 2018 at 6 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=629.807s">[Falco]</a>: And the members of this subcommittee are myself, Councilor Knight, and Councilor Longo Kern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=635.809s">[Falco]</a>: The purpose of the meeting was to review all papers assigned to the subcommittee of zoning and ordinances and to review zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=642.172s">[Falco]</a>: So at the beginning of this term, Mr. President, you decided to split these former zoning and ordinance subcommittee to two separate subcommittees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=652.195s">[Falco]</a>: One was zoning and one is ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=654.216s">[Falco]</a>: So what we did is we actually just went through the papers that were in committee and we moved<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=660.462s">[Falco]</a>: Papers 16555, 16660, 16705, 17542, 17094, 17321, and 17320 to the subcommittee on ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=662.244s">[Falco]</a>: Papers 16-359, 16-338.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=679.695s">[Falco]</a>: 16, 6, 2, 6, and 16, 6, 6, 6 are staying in the zoning subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=685.517s">[Falco]</a>: Uh, we also, I talked about, um, inclusionary housing and mixed use housing and the committee members are going to be doing some research, uh, or have been doing research over the past couple of weeks, uh, to, um, to present, uh, at a meeting, um, next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2592.35s">[Falco]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2593.33s">[Falco]</a>: Counsel Falco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2594.21s">[Falco]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2595.731s">[Falco]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2597.031s">[Falco]</a>: Thank you, Chief Sacco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2599.212s">[Falco]</a>: I find everything to be very alarming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2604.734s">[Falco]</a>: As a father of three kids in the Memphis Public Schools, I always feel that my kids are safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2611.804s">[Falco]</a>: And now I see something like this today, and I feel they're safe, but I have concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2616.928s">[Falco]</a>: And I think they're very valid concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2619.57s">[Falco]</a>: You know, as far as, you know, when we notify police about an incident like this, do we have a clear policy as to when?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2626.555s">[Falco]</a>: I mean, to me, there should be a clear, you know, I watch the commercials, I hear it on the radio, I see it on TV.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2633.059s">[Falco]</a>: See something, say something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2634.901s">[Falco]</a>: I tell my kids that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2636.602s">[Falco]</a>: You know, and I think it's a good theory to go by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2639.464s">[Falco]</a>: Because I think, you know, we need to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2641.328s">[Falco]</a>: keep law enforcement active and engaged in what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2644.57s">[Falco]</a>: To me, this is a clear case where see something, say something should have been the appropriate choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2656.478s">[Falco]</a>: Do we have a clear policy that says in this situation, there's some sort of ammunition and I'm no gun expert, but there's some sort of weapon that we contact the police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2719.509s">[Falco]</a>: What I would like to see is I would like to see the school committee work on a clear policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2733.603s">[Falco]</a>: But I think the parents as well, because if you're going to notify the school committee, that's going to go out to the general public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2739.564s">[Falco]</a>: So the general public should hear from our school leader, the superintendent saying, this is a concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2744.226s">[Falco]</a>: This is what's been found.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2745.386s">[Falco]</a>: This is what we think is happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2748.767s">[Falco]</a>: I mean, getting input from the chief as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2751.448s">[Falco]</a>: I think, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2753.148s">[Falco]</a>: You know, I understand that there are probably certain issues that are minor, that maybe not everyone needs to know about, if there's a fight in the playground or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2760.893s">[Falco]</a>: But something like this, where there's a piece of ammunition that's found, you know, within the school building, that that's a concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2768.558s">[Falco]</a>: And that's a concern that many people have here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2770.659s">[Falco]</a>: There's many people that are watching at home that have this concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2773.801s">[Falco]</a>: And I know all of us behind this reel have the same concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2888.798s">[Falco]</a>: Mr. Superintendent, I would honestly like to see you, the police chief Sacco, and the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2894.501s">[Falco]</a>: the mayor and the school committee come together and formulate a policy as to, you know, when, you know, to actually put a policy in place, when should the police be contacted about an issue like this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2905.748s">[Falco]</a>: Because I think there needs to be a clear definition, in my opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2909.051s">[Falco]</a>: I mean, I'd like to see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2912.433s">[Falco]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2913.113s">[Falco]</a>: Now, the Thursday night meeting, which I know I've received a ton of calls about, I believe that's going to be at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2919.077s">[Falco]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2919.377s">[Falco]</a>: I would respectfully ask that that be held here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2922.199s">[Falco]</a>: I think it's, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2924.264s">[Falco]</a>: from being a former school committee member, having meetings at the high school, the acoustics are really, they're not great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2930.509s">[Falco]</a>: I think you, my guess is you're gonna have a lot of people at this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2933.852s">[Falco]</a>: I think that it's better situated to be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2936.033s">[Falco]</a>: You have microphones, you have, people will be able to actually hear the dialogue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2940.577s">[Falco]</a>: This is an important topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2942.258s">[Falco]</a>: It's an important issue that people wanna know about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2944.6s">[Falco]</a>: They wanna know what happened, when it happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2946.521s">[Falco]</a>: They wanna see a timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2948.163s">[Falco]</a>: I think that if you try to have a meeting like that in a library or the superintendent's conference room,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2952.694s">[Falco]</a>: I really think that's probably not the best way to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2955.576s">[Falco]</a>: I think having it here at Chambers is the best venue to have the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2961.76s">[Falco]</a>: I think it seats more people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2963.301s">[Falco]</a>: And I think, like I said, the acoustics are much better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2965.383s">[Falco]</a>: I've been to budget meetings up at the library.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2967.964s">[Falco]</a>: And if you're sitting in the back, you really have no idea what's going on up at the front, just because the acoustics are not great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3037.564s">[Falco]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3039.886s">[Falco]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3040.966s">[Falco]</a>: With regard to the sweep of the schools,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3043.456s">[Falco]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3044.076s">[Falco]</a>: With regard to the sweep, uh, regarding the other schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3046.778s">[Falco]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3047.359s">[Falco]</a>: Uh, now you said that will be done in the near future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3049.44s">[Falco]</a>: Is that going to be done on the weekends?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3051.161s">[Falco]</a>: Uh, just because, I mean, we're asking that they begin tomorrow and they start doing it all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3058.046s">[Falco]</a>: So we sweeping schools while kids are in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3063.23s">[Falco]</a>: No, they're not there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3064.451s">[Falco]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3064.771s">[Falco]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3065.071s">[Falco]</a>: It's fake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3065.372s">[Falco]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3066.012s">[Falco]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3066.612s">[Falco]</a>: I should know that my kids are very excited about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3069.294s">[Falco]</a>: Um, with regard to, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3072.466s">[Falco]</a>: Now, with regard to our current situation, with our current protocols, we lock down the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3079.65s">[Falco]</a>: We lock down the schools currently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3081.371s">[Falco]</a>: If there's an issue and the schools go down, it's a lockdown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3085.353s">[Falco]</a>: I know we've talked about this before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3087.514s">[Falco]</a>: I've received a number of calls with regard to people asking about why aren't we using ALICE, which is a program that's well-known.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3096.159s">[Falco]</a>: Police Chief Sacco, I believe you know about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3097.94s">[Falco]</a>: And I believe there are members of the police force that are trained in the ALICE program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3102.594s">[Falco]</a>: Is that something that we are potentially looking at moving towards?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3106.796s">[Falco]</a>: Is that something that you think would be beneficial?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3110.298s">[Falco]</a>: I mean, I know there's a lot that goes into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3113.499s">[Falco]</a>: But if you could weigh in on that a little bit, because I know I've received a number of questions about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3168.912s">[Falco]</a>: I've done a little bit of research myself on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3172.214s">[Falco]</a>: And if you go online, there's videos.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3175.397s">[Falco]</a>: I think the City of Waltham has a video on it as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3179.561s">[Falco]</a>: And they do a good job of basically describing what it is and what you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3184.545s">[Falco]</a>: And they walk you through the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3188.53s">[Falco]</a>: From what I can see, it seems like it's a good program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3190.95s">[Falco]</a>: I think it's something that we should really look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3193.411s">[Falco]</a>: If it's something that you support, I really think that we should probably be moving in that direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3201.292s">[Falco]</a>: You're our expert with regards to law enforcement, and I think that- I don't know about expert, but- But I do feel that you really are our expert when it comes to law enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3211.874s">[Falco]</a>: You talk to people in other districts, and I know Superintendent Bellson, you do as well, but I think that this is something that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3218.364s">[Falco]</a>: In my opinion, this is something that the school committee should really consider.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3223.687s">[Falco]</a>: Looking into Alice, I know it doesn't happen overnight, but I think maybe we should look into it and probably by the fall, by the next school year, it's something that we should implement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3234.833s">[Falco]</a>: So if we could, and I'm not sure if you could possibly add that to your agenda for Thursday night, but I think it's something that should be considered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3481.612s">[Falco]</a>: Well, I mean, I think it's something that should be looked at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3484.174s">[Falco]</a>: I think the school committee should seriously consider it, at least at the high school level, maybe even the middle school level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3492.598s">[Falco]</a>: I understand there's concerns at the elementary school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3495.021s">[Falco]</a>: I get that, but I think, especially if it's something, Chief, that you're a fan of, I would think that it's something that should be considered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3502.467s">[Falco]</a>: I'd like to see that part of a future school committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3506.711s">[Falco]</a>: I think it's something that they should look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3509.933s">[Falco]</a>: With regard to the McGlynn staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3513.676s">[Falco]</a>: Now, I believe you said you may possibly meet with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3517.475s">[Falco]</a>: Is that something that's going to happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3519.376s">[Falco]</a>: I mean, is there a demand there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3528.203s">[Falco]</a>: Well, I thank you for answering all my questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3532.206s">[Falco]</a>: That's all I have for now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3535.349s">[Falco]</a>: Like I said, I'm a big fan of see something, say something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3538.771s">[Falco]</a>: I think that should have been the first thing, the first approach that you should have taken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3544.316s">[Falco]</a>: I thank you for your time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3545.837s">[Falco]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8663.95s">[Falco]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8664.971s">[Falco]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8665.451s">[Falco]</a>: So, uh, when, when will people officially know maybe the city clerk where the meeting is going to be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8672.854s">[Falco]</a>: I strongly feel it should be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8675.305s">[Falco]</a>: in these chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8676.146s">[Falco]</a>: I mean, is it definitely going to be here, or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8678.487s">[Falco]</a>: Oh, it's up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8709.517s">[Falco]</a>: Can we do a reverse, can we do a reverse 9-1-1?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8920.829s">[Falco]</a>: There was a matter earlier tonight, the Committee of the Whole, to review a open meeting law complaint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8930.858s">[Falco]</a>: And we found that the complaint was not valid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8941.315s">[Falco]</a>: Yes, and the city solicitor will be writing up a response to the person that made the claim to, I believe, the Attorney General's Office.<br><br>
