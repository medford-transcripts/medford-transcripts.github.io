    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6426.863s">[Branley]</a>: Nicole Brantley, our address is on file, but needs to be omitted publicly due to our safety concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6434.929s">[Branley]</a>: This is my first time speaking at a meeting, and I want to thank you all for this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6439.072s">[Branley]</a>: I have heard from the mayor personally, and I appreciate your story and your time, each and every one of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6446.917s">[Branley]</a>: Mr. Russo, you must have lost my email address because I have not heard from you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6452.472s">[Branley]</a>: My husband and I have been lifelong Medford residents and have always been proud to be raising our family here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6458.695s">[Branley]</a>: We both attended Method Public Schools and graduated Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6462.777s">[Branley]</a>: There was never a second guess in sending our children to public school here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6474.042s">[Branley]</a>: Sadly, my daughter encountered some very alarming and repetitive acts of harassment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6483.041s">[Branley]</a>: Bullying and threats at the high school, which led to a vicious physical assault that sent her to the hospital on October 17th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6493.93s">[Branley]</a>: I'm not here to speak specifically about her situation, but more of the broader scope of what my eyes have been open to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6502.236s">[Branley]</a>: Safety in our schools is imperative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6506.36s">[Branley]</a>: News reports of mass shootings that have inflicted on our most vulnerable, our innocent children are everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6513.237s">[Branley]</a>: But not until my own daughter's horror story began in June, did I ever really consider that the child sitting next to her would be such a one-on-one threat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6522.626s">[Branley]</a>: But that is exactly what happened when she was attacked two-on-one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6528.833s">[Branley]</a>: So many people reached out to us when news got around what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6532.176s">[Branley]</a>: Sadly, many shared their own bullying stories with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6536.874s">[Branley]</a>: I'm sorry that they had to go through that, but I know that the apology does not have to come from me, but it should come from their bully, from their attacker, and from our school district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6558.709s">[Branley]</a>: I have heard from countless Method public school victims of bullying in the last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6563.252s">[Branley]</a>: Every story has been more horrifying than the next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6566.923s">[Branley]</a>: This is not a new issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6568.584s">[Branley]</a>: As a mom, I know how these mothers feel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6575.628s">[Branley]</a>: Helpless, angry, heartbroken, and terrified to send their child back to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6589.235s">[Branley]</a>: I worry too about the students who don't feel comfortable going to the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6594.85s">[Branley]</a>: or even to their parents or guardians to say what is happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6599.593s">[Branley]</a>: What about them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6602.695s">[Branley]</a>: I was the ultra proactive mom in our situation and this violence still occurred.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6610.439s">[Branley]</a>: What is the breaking point here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6614.161s">[Branley]</a>: What about the long-term effects of this on our victims?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6617.984s">[Branley]</a>: My daughter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6621.846s">[Branley]</a>: At one point, at one point during the last few weeks, I realized something even more horrifying, that our daughter will carry this story with her through her whole life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6643.481s">[Branley]</a>: One friend told me about her bully in a Method elementary school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6647.203s">[Branley]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6651.567s">[Branley]</a>: back when she was 11.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6655.689s">[Branley]</a>: She is now 53 years old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6659.51s">[Branley]</a>: She asked me not to share her specific story publicly, but fear that her bully still lives in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6672.856s">[Branley]</a>: 42 years have gone by for her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6674.096s">[Branley]</a>: 42, and she still is in fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6681.249s">[Branley]</a>: Our school system let her down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6684.35s">[Branley]</a>: They let our family down and countless others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6692.292s">[Branley]</a>: I have heard so many stories this week that bullies or aggressors that are in a fight have actually returned to school from their punishments before the victim could heal from the injuries in return.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6705.495s">[Branley]</a>: That is backwards and it needs to change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6722.297s">[Branley]</a>: Not all the stories I have heard have been under your administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6728.021s">[Branley]</a>: Or during the time of your elected positions, but our story is and so are countless others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6734.805s">[Branley]</a>: Although you cannot change the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6738.568s">[Branley]</a>: You certainly need to step up now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6741.509s">[Branley]</a>: Medford can be the example of the school district that set the bar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6746.562s">[Branley]</a>: Our school should be on the news for positive stories, not ones of violence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6752.327s">[Branley]</a>: I am hoping moving forward, we could work together to actually make sure the policies we have in place are sufficient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6758.932s">[Branley]</a>: And if so, that they are being implemented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6761.995s">[Branley]</a>: I think it's long overdue that children see consequences for their bullying, harassing and fighting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6768.4s">[Branley]</a>: Maybe if students know they will be held accountable and consequences are imminent, that they will think twice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6776.457s">[Branley]</a>: Even more importantly, that no one else has to be a victim of such a crime and that students who choose to use their fists and hateful words to solve problems actually see consequences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6787.521s">[Branley]</a>: If zero tolerance is stated as part of our Mustang way, then follow through has to be too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6795.945s">[Branley]</a>: Actions speak louder than words and the students know it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6800.647s">[Branley]</a>: They know it's only lip service from you right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6804.366s">[Branley]</a>: It is our job as the adults to set the standards for what we are willing to accept.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6811.008s">[Branley]</a>: What is allowed in our school defines the morals of the city and our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6826.692s">[Branley]</a>: I've done a lot of reading in the last few weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6830.113s">[Branley]</a>: And in our own handbook, it says following policies,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6834.133s">[Branley]</a>: are consistent with the mission statement to set expectations for students and to offer them considerable motivation and support as a way to help them become responsible citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6847.602s">[Branley]</a>: The time is now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6850.884s">[Branley]</a>: I make a vow in front of all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6853.145s">[Branley]</a>: I will help be a part of the change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6856.247s">[Branley]</a>: Tell me what you need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6857.408s">[Branley]</a>: Tell me what I can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6858.909s">[Branley]</a>: Tell me where I can sign up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6861.479s">[Branley]</a>: Do you need more funding?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6863.299s">[Branley]</a>: Tell me who I need to contact, because I will do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6866.76s">[Branley]</a>: Do we need another assistant principal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6870.361s">[Branley]</a>: The relationships we have built with the school resource officer has been a great one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6876.122s">[Branley]</a>: Could we have maybe one more to help him try to cover multiple buildings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6887.604s">[Branley]</a>: Help him cover multiple buildings and over 1,200 students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6891.496s">[Branley]</a>: Can you type up a clear policy that every child actually has to read and sign every year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6896.158s">[Branley]</a>: There's gotta be options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6898.339s">[Branley]</a>: Can we make clear that prom, sports, homecoming, that those are privileges and they could lose them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6904.661s">[Branley]</a>: Students need routine, they need encouragement, they need love, they need discipline, and they need a hard line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6912.604s">[Branley]</a>: So draw the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6916.966s">[Branley]</a>: What are you specifically going to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6920.683s">[Branley]</a>: starting now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6922.925s">[Branley]</a>: Maybe our school committee members should start walking the halls of Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6937.137s">[Branley]</a>: Maybe you can spend some time in the cafeteria at lunch or check in on a bathroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6944.023s">[Branley]</a>: I wholeheartedly agree that every child has a right to a public education<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6950.444s">[Branley]</a>: We have exemplary teachers in our district implementing amazing curriculum while nurturing our students to be the best they can be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6961.65s">[Branley]</a>: If no expulsions are set forth, then we need to be able to find solutions and education plans for aggressors in an alternative school setting, especially away from the victims to ensure safety for all the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6986.317s">[Branley]</a>: Introducing violent bullies back into the corridors with their victim is assaulting them again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6991.567s">[Branley]</a>: Only this time, you will be the bully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6994.894s">[Branley]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7563.937s">[Branley]</a>: So just to go on with Jenny had just said, it really does come down to accountability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7577.463s">[Branley]</a>: If the superintendent is accountable for our schools, then why has it not been done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7583.565s">[Branley]</a>: Please do your job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7588.968s">[Branley]</a>: Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7594.502s">[Branley]</a>: And I need the school committee to make her accountable for her job, because here are the voters and we're gonna make you accountable for your job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7604.827s">[Branley]</a>: Mayor, what will be the new deadline for this climate and culture report?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7615.931s">[Branley]</a>: Is there a new deadline?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7616.732s">[Branley]</a>: Was there a deadline originally?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1904.526s">[Branley]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1905.947s">[Branley]</a>: Member Brantley?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1907.028s">[Branley]</a>: My child is a student in this program, so I don't know if I should abstain from the vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1910.47s">[Branley]</a>: I'm all for it, but I don't know if it's a conflict, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1913.352s">[Branley]</a>: Not a conflict.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1915.393s">[Branley]</a>: Anybody?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1915.733s">[Branley]</a>: Is she attending?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1917.054s">[Branley]</a>: She's attending.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1917.614s">[Branley]</a>: Still not a conflict.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1919.514s">[Branley]</a>: Yeah, it's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1921.034s">[Branley]</a>: They're telling me it's good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1922.295s">[Branley]</a>: Yes, I'll second then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1926.396s">[Branley]</a>: I mean, I want to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1928.476s">[Branley]</a>: I want to come eat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1982.323s">[Branley]</a>: Can I, can I ask a question on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1983.565s">[Branley]</a>: Just being a newbie, if the field trip is within the first couple of weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4948.263s">[Branley]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4949.523s">[Branley]</a>: Yes, Member Brindley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4950.544s">[Branley]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4951.804s">[Branley]</a>: Can we get a regular update on enrollment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4955.025s">[Branley]</a>: Monthly, quarterly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4956.707s">[Branley]</a>: somewhere just to see how our numbers are staying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4959.749s">[Branley]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4960.489s">[Branley]</a>: You mean this report?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4961.63s">[Branley]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4962.21s">[Branley]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4962.59s">[Branley]</a>: Just a little bit regularly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4963.951s">[Branley]</a>: Just so, you know, even if it was like January 1st or come the spring, just to see where we stand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4969.955s">[Branley]</a>: I'm just, I don't know if there's a time for that, but just curious with, you know, cuts that we made and budget issues, you know, are we being supported properly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4980.641s">[Branley]</a>: You know, nurse guidance, all the things that we worried about back in May and June, some of those things haven't changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4985.684s">[Branley]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4986.503s">[Branley]</a>: concerns me with some of the numbers so i just want to make sure that we're where we're supposed to be thank you no problem member graham<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5446.786s">[Branley]</a>: Member Brantley?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5447.447s">[Branley]</a>: Can we just have a copy of that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5448.647s">[Branley]</a>: That's not in our packet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5449.668s">[Branley]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5449.908s">[Branley]</a>: Those two pages with the personnel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5450.888s">[Branley]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8382.061s">[Branley]</a>: Thank you, Member Bramley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8385.344s">[Branley]</a>: I just want to agree with Member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8388.146s">[Branley]</a>: The proactive word was used, and I feel like we are a district that is constantly reactive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8393.274s">[Branley]</a>: And it's aggravating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8395.475s">[Branley]</a>: It's aggravating to see that I feel like in so many different aspects, we react to things that happen instead of being proactive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8401.477s">[Branley]</a>: And I would love to hop on board to anybody that wants to be proactive because I'll come to every meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8405.799s">[Branley]</a>: But let's be proactive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8407.12s">[Branley]</a>: We know school's going to start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8408.36s">[Branley]</a>: We know it's going to be warm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8409.861s">[Branley]</a>: We know that, you know, it's going to get cold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8412.602s">[Branley]</a>: Like, we know these things are going to happen, yet we're always shocked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8416.203s">[Branley]</a>: And it blows my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8418.344s">[Branley]</a>: And yet I don't know why I'm surprised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8420.565s">[Branley]</a>: So I think if we could be proactive, that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8423.564s">[Branley]</a>: we know kids are gonna take the bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8425.686s">[Branley]</a>: I was a parent that always filled out that, oh yeah, we live here and we're gonna take the bus to the Brooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8434.212s">[Branley]</a>: I don't know why we always end up in a predicament like this and it's for more than one subject.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8439.216s">[Branley]</a>: And it's just like member Graham said, being proactive, we know school's gonna start next year, we know we need the buses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8445.681s">[Branley]</a>: And obviously there's some stuff that we can't control in many different aspects, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8449.724s">[Branley]</a>: this seems something that we can control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8451.705s">[Branley]</a>: So I know that you said that you had a meeting coming up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8454.847s">[Branley]</a>: I would love to join you because I think that this is imperative that, you know, two weeks into school that we're telling parents, well, now we can't take your kid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8462.372s">[Branley]</a>: Well, you know, and you said, well, we're not going to leave your child out, you know, if it's unsafe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8468.496s">[Branley]</a>: Who's going to make that judgment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8470.497s">[Branley]</a>: You?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8471.638s">[Branley]</a>: I'm not saying that you can't, but is the parent going to make that judgment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8474.359s">[Branley]</a>: Well, I don't think my child can cross Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8476.681s">[Branley]</a>: Oh, well, it's only a mile, so they can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8479.275s">[Branley]</a>: don't think that's fair who's who's to say whose child is more responsible to to cross high street or you know i know that my son has said to me before when he was at the at the middle school i'm going to ride my bike there what from west medford that makes no sense to me it's too far you know what i mean it's too it's it's rush hour traffic there's so many you know obviously the bus to me would be the safest route for you to get your kid to school and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8505.683s">[Branley]</a>: There is the convenience of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8506.783s">[Branley]</a>: People have to get to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8508.164s">[Branley]</a>: This is a district that the majority of parents are two working parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8513.365s">[Branley]</a>: And, you know, they have to get to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8517.026s">[Branley]</a>: And to think the kids are going to walk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8518.206s">[Branley]</a>: I mean, I know when I go for a walk, it takes me 15 to 20 minutes to walk a mile.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8522.807s">[Branley]</a>: So what time are kids getting up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8524.648s">[Branley]</a>: What time are we sending them out the door?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8525.948s">[Branley]</a>: Is it dark?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8527.368s">[Branley]</a>: Because I think this all has to factor into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8531.009s">[Branley]</a>: And I just think it's such a, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8535.439s">[Branley]</a>: broad aspect of saying like you know we're going to make sure the kids are safe but who's who's going to be the final say and what's safe for each individual kid so i just think that we just have to throw that out there and like i said i'd be more than happy to hop on board with any transportation meetings coming up so if you can let me know i'd be more than happy to do that so thank you thank you um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7233.789s">[Branley]</a>: Hello?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7234.089s">[Branley]</a>: Testing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8079.736s">[Branley]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8081.196s">[Branley]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9952.908s">[Branley]</a>: Member Brantley?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9955.19s">[Branley]</a>: I just want to piggyback what Member Rousseau said about making sure that we have guidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9960.834s">[Branley]</a>: I believe my favorite word here is being proactive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9963.977s">[Branley]</a>: So we can just be proactive to protect you guys, to protect us, obviously, as a district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9969.521s">[Branley]</a>: And then I'm just also curious with the paying,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9975.959s">[Branley]</a>: Obviously, if you're not paying, you can still park at school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9980.78s">[Branley]</a>: You're not parking at school at all if you don't pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9984.782s">[Branley]</a>: Correct, okay, so that's obviously gonna be told to everybody that's parking is gonna understand that if you don't pay the $75, you can't park at school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10077.076s">[Branley]</a>: And so then just my other question is, would this be something that's done after school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10082.965s">[Branley]</a>: When would we be painting if that was the case?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10085.389s">[Branley]</a>: Do you have any ideas, Mr. Casey?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10106.187s">[Branley]</a>: And obviously the school is being used during that time too, for activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10116.252s">[Branley]</a>: Okay, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10118.629s">[Branley]</a>: Do we have to motion on the floor to make this two separate votes, 175 for the spot and then 175 for the painting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10125.951s">[Branley]</a>: If somebody wants to sever, otherwise we can move approval of the whole thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10129.792s">[Branley]</a>: I'd like to sever it so that we can have motion to sever the $75 for the spot and then $75 for the painting, if that's possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10992.044s">[Branley]</a>: So I just have a question on number two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10994.646s">[Branley]</a>: If we eliminate the MCAS as the standard, then what are we using as a requirement for competency to graduate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11001.13s">[Branley]</a>: So it moves to the district to define student competencies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9524.035s">[Branley]</a>: Member Bramley?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9525.416s">[Branley]</a>: So acts of words of aggression if device is tampered with, have we seen that devices have been tampered with?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9577.305s">[Branley]</a>: And then with the acts of words or aggression, how are we following up with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9661.4s">[Branley]</a>: So just a follow-up question on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9663.101s">[Branley]</a>: With the amount that the device is going off, say 104 times for the second floor boys bathroom, is that bathroom being monitored?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9669.965s">[Branley]</a>: I mean, I'm assuming no one's running to the bathroom 104 times during a day to see the device went off, so what's happening?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1736.712s">[Branley]</a>: So I'm just wondering if we can have a copy of that slideshow sent to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1741.953s">[Branley]</a>: Each of us can have that slideshow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1745.494s">[Branley]</a>: Before this testing was done, was the city testing the water?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1750.315s">[Branley]</a>: I know the city tests the water every week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1752.255s">[Branley]</a>: Are the schools part of that testing regularly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1773.168s">[Branley]</a>: Do the testing that came from this go to the water department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1778.891s">[Branley]</a>: What is the follow through in collaboration with the city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1847.886s">[Branley]</a>: Okay, so the Department of Public Health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1850.748s">[Branley]</a>: The plan moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1851.609s">[Branley]</a>: Can we be notified what the plan is going to be moving forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1857.954s">[Branley]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1859.175s">[Branley]</a>: Um, I think that might be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1862.038s">[Branley]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4800.943s">[Branley]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4801.603s">[Branley]</a>: Thank you, Megan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4802.303s">[Branley]</a>: Member Brantley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4802.963s">[Branley]</a>: So just a couple of points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4803.924s">[Branley]</a>: Jessica, yes, I was gonna just say thank you for all that you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4806.984s">[Branley]</a>: In Somerville, I work side by side with the Somerville Special Education Transportation Department, and the transportation calls never end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4814.467s">[Branley]</a>: And it's all year round.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4816.207s">[Branley]</a>: I mean, we have extended school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4818.408s">[Branley]</a>: That's another whole project in itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4822.315s">[Branley]</a>: field trips, day-to-day, it never ends, detours, road closures, unexpected things, a car accident, changes a whole route for a bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4831.339s">[Branley]</a>: So I just want you to know that I do appreciate everything that you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4834.561s">[Branley]</a>: I obviously don't work hand-in-hand with you here at Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4838.083s">[Branley]</a>: But just another point, with the kids getting on the buses, I worked in the kindergarten classroom for six years at the Brooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4847.607s">[Branley]</a>: Dismissal is chaos.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4849.54s">[Branley]</a>: especially in the kindergarten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4850.86s">[Branley]</a>: Five-year-olds don't always know where they're going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4852.941s">[Branley]</a>: They don't know what day it is all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4857.442s">[Branley]</a>: It's great to say, give the bus driver a note.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4860.883s">[Branley]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4862.343s">[Branley]</a>: But on the day-to-day in the classroom, I just can see how that could just be nearly impossible at times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4870.186s">[Branley]</a>: A child goes up to the bus at one time, one week with two aides and maybe a teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4879.531s">[Branley]</a>: they get up to the gym and then it's you're off to your bus line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4885.814s">[Branley]</a>: Those people change constantly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4889.856s">[Branley]</a>: Different staff covered different weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4892.497s">[Branley]</a>: So I don't know how to really make it as smooth as I would love to see it, or as you would love to see it, or the bus driver would love to see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4901.681s">[Branley]</a>: I give all the kudos to the bus drivers because I've been on plenty of field trips for my own children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4909.321s">[Branley]</a>: I wouldn't be a bus driver.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4910.941s">[Branley]</a>: So I big huge kudos to the bus drivers also because they are really the ones on the ground doing all the work, you know, day in and day out with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4920.183s">[Branley]</a>: I think we all you know anybody that has children know the chaos of having your own children in the car asking for something when you have one or two children that are asking a question, let alone 60 or 70 kids that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4935.089s">[Branley]</a>: is beyond imagination to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4938.392s">[Branley]</a>: But I really think it's great that everybody has their tags.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4941.435s">[Branley]</a>: I was the one that put the tags on the kids in the kindergarten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4943.797s">[Branley]</a>: It's a great system, but those tags fall off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4946.679s">[Branley]</a>: You forget your backpack one day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4948.161s">[Branley]</a>: A million things can happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4951.083s">[Branley]</a>: So I don't know how we really make this like the smoothest process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4954.346s">[Branley]</a>: But obviously, I know our staff<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4957.34s">[Branley]</a>: would do anything, you know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4958.66s">[Branley]</a>: Obviously to ensure that the kids are getting in the right place and so are you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4961.141s">[Branley]</a>: So a big, huge kudos to everybody that's working this constantly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4965.903s">[Branley]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>
