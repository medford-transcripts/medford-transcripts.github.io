    <a href="https://youtu.be/awwGd9-ntWI&t=48.808s">[Tseng]</a>: We want our leaders to be proactive and to listen to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/awwGd9-ntWI&t=52.409s">[Tseng]</a>: and to be truthful to us and not to go about what students perceive as the Medford way, backroom deals and talking behind our backs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1080.391s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1081.532s">[Tseng]</a>: I understand, you know, one of the council's main priorities going in before<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1086.736s">[Tseng]</a>: Knowing that this might be an option in the coming years was to maximize this senior circuit breaker for the tax deferrals and to push for the senior work-off program to get more of that done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1102.431s">[Tseng]</a>: It's my understanding that folks can find out more about the senior tax deferral from the assessor's office, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1951.16s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1952.182s">[Tseng]</a>: Sorry, Councilor Sang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1953.924s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1955.285s">[Tseng]</a>: Councilor Collins, I think, touched on a list of positions that, subject to the school committee talks, might be at stake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1961.532s">[Tseng]</a>: Literacy specialists, school nurses, guidance, mental health specialists, increased class sizes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1966.558s">[Tseng]</a>: You know, it's not fear-mongering when a lot of this stuff has already happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1969.261s">[Tseng]</a>: happening in our school districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1970.322s">[Tseng]</a>: We've already had to make a lot of these cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1972.343s">[Tseng]</a>: We've already found it hard to retain our long-term teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1977.166s">[Tseng]</a>: We also need to take a step back and look at this big picture-wise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1979.767s">[Tseng]</a>: We know when we invest in our schools, your investment and your value of your property goes up as well, that your public safety around you, crime goes down and public safety goes up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1990.673s">[Tseng]</a>: And so we, I think there are longer, bigger picture benefits to everyone, even if you don't have kids in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1996.737s">[Tseng]</a>: Touching on the roads real quick, because that's also a part of question seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2001.579s">[Tseng]</a>: I think we need to look at the opportunity we lose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2004.721s">[Tseng]</a>: Now, the basic role of government, of local government is to fix your potholes and to send your kids to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2010.384s">[Tseng]</a>: And if we're not, if we can't do either of those, then we're not, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2014.406s">[Tseng]</a>: we're not doing our jobs, but we were asking the voters to give us the tools to do our jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2018.727s">[Tseng]</a>: And something about question seven with the roads and sidewalks is that it would give us a crew that would work full time on fixing our potholes and sidewalks in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2028.07s">[Tseng]</a>: That's something that we don't have right now because our resources are too constrained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2031.471s">[Tseng]</a>: And that's something that I believe if passed, will show, will give our residents a real benefit, a real benefit that you can see and live in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2041.616s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you for the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3061.704s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3062.004s">[Tseng]</a>: Councilor Seng, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3062.924s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3063.944s">[Tseng]</a>: Touching very quickly on the topic of new growth, I think our council is very aware that new growth is the priority for Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3069.466s">[Tseng]</a>: And so when we look at the last three years of new growth, so the last two years plus the estimates that we have right in front of us presented by the assessor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3080.629s">[Tseng]</a>: It actually shows that our first round of zoning reform, which was the first round in almost 50 years of zoning reform, actually has led to the most new growth our city has seen in decades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3090.612s">[Tseng]</a>: We are currently working on round two of zoning reform and we are very, very optimistic that that new growth will help us achieve more financial stability going into the future as long as these questions pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3103.755s">[Tseng]</a>: I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3104.935s">[Tseng]</a>: I also have this chart right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3109.239s">[Tseng]</a>: I'll do what Councilor Callahan does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3111.301s">[Tseng]</a>: It's not really easy to see, but you can see that the new growth is growing throughout the last few years with the reforms that we've instituted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3121.429s">[Tseng]</a>: We are permitting more units as Councilor- Could you put that chart back up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3127.214s">[Tseng]</a>: We're also permitting more new,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3130.194s">[Tseng]</a>: new units than ever before, as Councilor Scarpaoli states.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3135.748s">[Tseng]</a>: Here's the thing, because on the topic of new growth, we're getting a little bit away from the why now question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3144.271s">[Tseng]</a>: We have a plan, that plan is being implemented, and the results are already bearing fruit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3149.112s">[Tseng]</a>: We fell behind decades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3151.293s">[Tseng]</a>: I mean, that's just the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3152.513s">[Tseng]</a>: We fell behind decades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3153.854s">[Tseng]</a>: And I don't agree with every decision that the mayors previous have taken, but we are in a situation now where we need<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3161.596s">[Tseng]</a>: to face the facts as they are now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3163.438s">[Tseng]</a>: High inflation, lack of new growth over the last few decades means that we need to do a short-term plan, which is these three questions, and then a long-term plan, which is investing in new growth, which is what our zoning efforts are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3179.075s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3179.495s">[Tseng]</a>: Councillor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4727.182s">[Tseng]</a>: two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4727.942s">[Tseng]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4728.402s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4729.183s">[Tseng]</a>: Um, I mean, continuing off of Councilor Lemming's points, those conversations are ones that we're having in public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4735.704s">[Tseng]</a>: I believe that there's an upcoming City Committee of the Whole meeting at some point that we're going to talk about some of how free cash is going to be used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4744.286s">[Tseng]</a>: I know the mayor submitted a paper to us with her proposal and asking us for feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4749.467s">[Tseng]</a>: That's all in the council records.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4750.888s">[Tseng]</a>: It's all online for folks to find as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4755.809s">[Tseng]</a>: Here's the thing about free cash, right, because it's a one time fund, we should be using it on one time expenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4762.219s">[Tseng]</a>: And that's why we're using it on things like roads on the light poles that President Barrett was talking about on HVAC systems and whatnot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4772.233s">[Tseng]</a>: We all know that these are real things that affect how we experience living in our city, affects our kids in our public buildings, and so they are very important expenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4781.242s">[Tseng]</a>: Now, added on top of that is the conversation we would have if we didn't spend that money right now, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4787.649s">[Tseng]</a>: Because if we defer maintenance, which I think everyone in the audience today<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4792.398s">[Tseng]</a>: acknowledges this has been happening in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4795.14s">[Tseng]</a>: If we defer maintenance, those costs go up as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4797.902s">[Tseng]</a>: And so we need to basically map out all of our uses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4801.464s">[Tseng]</a>: And that's why our city has been implementing our capital improvement plans, why we've started to take registries of everything that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4809.97s">[Tseng]</a>: that we're falling behind on maintenance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4812.874s">[Tseng]</a>: Our buildings director is really good with that work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4815.838s">[Tseng]</a>: And so that's why those funds should be allocated to things like that rather than being used one time on recurring expenses that we can't afford in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4826.092s">[Tseng]</a>: So I feel very strongly about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4828.113s">[Tseng]</a>: The bond agencies feel very strongly about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4830.953s">[Tseng]</a>: And in fact, if we take the free cash and use that free cash on recurring expenses, it's widely known that the bond agencies would lower our credit rating, as Councilor Callahan mentioned, and our costs for borrowing to do that maintenance work in the future would actually go up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4845.618s">[Tseng]</a>: And so that's something that would be an increased cost on all of us as taxpayers in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4852.336s">[Tseng]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6197.77s">[Tseng]</a>: I'll be very brief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6199.492s">[Tseng]</a>: There's been only one Councillor here tonight that's asked the voters in the room to vote a certain way, and it's not me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6207.401s">[Tseng]</a>: not a certain number of other counselors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6209.002s">[Tseng]</a>: So I did say that we approve these because we saw that voting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6211.544s">[Tseng]</a>: So two counselors, but pay attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6227.634s">[Tseng]</a>: I am paying attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6228.895s">[Tseng]</a>: You didn't read the budget, but anyways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6230.876s">[Tseng]</a>: It's embarrassing, man.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6233.537s">[Tseng]</a>: I apologize for letting this get off the track.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6236.018s">[Tseng]</a>: The question was about, I think- It's not your fault.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6239.5s">[Tseng]</a>: There was one aspect of the question about the new growth and coming back to ask, the voters to ask for another override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6248.305s">[Tseng]</a>: And I believe the financial task force has been pretty open in saying that we believe that with new growth coming in,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6254.644s">[Tseng]</a>: in talking to the developers who are looking to develop on the properties that we're rezoning for and looking at the projects that are coming into our city, we believe that we won't need to ask for another override until that exclusion for that school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6267.337s">[Tseng]</a>: That's something that we, you know, are very open in conversations that we have with our planning department staff, with our assessing staff here in the city council chambers and in their offices as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6278.429s">[Tseng]</a>: And to the point of us, the fear tactic of us coming back next year, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6287.594s">[Tseng]</a>: There is one opportunity offered tonight where we do come back next year, and that's kicking the can down the road by using free cash this year, which would guarantee that we come back to this exact same position next year as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7451.05s">[Tseng]</a>: I'll be very brief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7453.253s">[Tseng]</a>: It's in state procurement law, and I believe that this is the process moving forward that we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7459.58s">[Tseng]</a>: you know, we can plan to a certain threshold, but then we need to find the source of revenue that we have to pay for that project before we move on that much further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7467.904s">[Tseng]</a>: And so that's where we are in the process is where at this, uh, at the step in the process where we're identifying that source of revenue for the project moving on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7476.128s">[Tseng]</a>: So it's premature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7477.408s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11088.702s">[Tseng]</a>: Um, counselor saying two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11091.525s">[Tseng]</a>: I'll be extremely brief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11092.946s">[Tseng]</a>: Um, because I think a lot of this is, has been said before, um, the way I view it is there's a question out there about why are we doing it twice when, you know, we need to do the basics and I, you know, question seven gives us the, the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11107.399s">[Tseng]</a>: ability to do the basics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11109.06s">[Tseng]</a>: Question eight allows us to think bigger picture and think about how we can improve the school system, not merely just matching status quo, but to exceed status quo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11119.746s">[Tseng]</a>: I think there are a variety of different perspectives on that specific policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11123.728s">[Tseng]</a>: That's why we're opposing it to the voters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11125.469s">[Tseng]</a>: That's why we're letting voters vote on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11127.431s">[Tseng]</a>: But<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11128.615s">[Tseng]</a>: we do need the money first to be able to engage in a real comprehensive renegotiation of what that school day looks like, of what programs we can offer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11139.239s">[Tseng]</a>: And this is just the point of disagreement between me and my fellow counselor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11143.96s">[Tseng]</a>: I think Medford parents and Medford students know that our schools don't offer the same programming the other school districts do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11149.713s">[Tseng]</a>: I think Medford parents, Medford students know that we're falling short and that we have a lot of programming that we need to catch up on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11156.974s">[Tseng]</a>: It's, you know, we have great teachers doing arts programs, sports programs, coaches doing sports programs, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11163.316s">[Tseng]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11164.396s">[Tseng]</a>: But the question is, are we where we should be comprehensively?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11169.717s">[Tseng]</a>: You know, we've already had to merge drama classes to cut offerings in the arts in the last budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11175.598s">[Tseng]</a>: The question is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11177.925s">[Tseng]</a>: do we stay there, do we keep with that, or do we expand our offerings for our children?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12587.6s">[Tseng]</a>: Great, Councilor Seng, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12589.08s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12589.78s">[Tseng]</a>: I just wanted to speak to the grant part of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12591.861s">[Tseng]</a>: I know, as President Baird said before, our city departments work very, very hard to apply to as many grants as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12599.323s">[Tseng]</a>: But I think when we think about applying to grants, which I'm totally behind, I think we should do, we should maximize it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12605.245s">[Tseng]</a>: We also have to keep in mind that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12607.125s">[Tseng]</a>: it takes a team of grant writers and grant managers after we get that grant to put that grant into practice and do all the reporting and counting that we need for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12615.428s">[Tseng]</a>: And so that actually takes a lot of staff capacity on the city hall end right now that we don't have that general fund capacity for either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12623.792s">[Tseng]</a>: So that's, you know, another, I think, reason why<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12626.533s">[Tseng]</a>: paying attention to like increasing the revenue for our city government is so, so important, because it allows us to eventually, eventually gives us the freedom to, to have people in place to be applying to those grants that make more money over, over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12641.365s">[Tseng]</a>: So it's kind of like a stone rolling down a mountain collecting dirt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12646.88s">[Tseng]</a>: I, another thing about grants though, is that oftentimes they're not over a long enough period of time for us to be able to retain the staff that we want to, as Councillor Callahan mentioned, like if you're a teacher, you want to make sure that you can stay in that position next year, that you're, you're having that job or else you're, you're applying to other jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12663.167s">[Tseng]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12663.928s">[Tseng]</a>: And I think that's the case when we apply for grants as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12667.749s">[Tseng]</a>: That's why, you know, we have great workers in city hall hired on grants, but a lot of them don't,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12674.512s">[Tseng]</a>: are looking for other jobs because they don't have that stability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12677.495s">[Tseng]</a>: And so we need to give our city that financial, in my opinion, that financial stability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12682.499s">[Tseng]</a>: On the points of competitive salaries, I think it's really important to also consider that our teachers are competing or our school systems competing with private schools as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12696.051s">[Tseng]</a>: And that there's this, there's a race to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12698.773s">[Tseng]</a>: to pay teachers more, to pay for diversity, all of that is affecting how our ability to retain our staff and to hire new staff as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12707.579s">[Tseng]</a>: That's not to mention the district-specific characteristics that come out in a union bargaining sessions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12713.063s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Strange.<br><br>
