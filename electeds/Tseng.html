    <a href="https://youtu.be/awwGd9-ntWI&t=48.808s">[Tseng]</a>: We want our leaders to be proactive and to listen to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/awwGd9-ntWI&t=52.409s">[Tseng]</a>: and to be truthful to us and not to go about what students perceive as the Medford way, backroom deals and talking behind our backs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2220.779s">[Tseng]</a>: I just wanted to wish you the best of luck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2223.42s">[Tseng]</a>: My friends and I have always wanted a bubble tea shop in Medford and it's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2229.016s">[Tseng]</a>: It's a great honor for us to be able to have one to call our own.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2232.837s">[Tseng]</a>: So thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2234.698s">[Tseng]</a>: And good luck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2235.998s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3710.327s">[Tseng]</a>: All right, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3714.792s">[Tseng]</a>: First of all, I just wanted to thank you and your department for all of this work that you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3719.853s">[Tseng]</a>: I think something that a few of us, many of us on this side of the rail have been talking about, a lot of community leaders have been talking about is the importance of bringing government to the people and not just expecting people to show up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3736.037s">[Tseng]</a>: We all know that there are real equity access barriers when it comes to meetings, even meetings like this,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3743.917s">[Tseng]</a>: any city meeting, any coming to city events, and your department's, I think, philosophical approach to outreach, I think is something that we should be proud that we're doing as a city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3761.301s">[Tseng]</a>: I know it can be really tough to do that outreach, and so I was wondering what some of the challenges that you've found were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3770.303s">[Tseng]</a>: Maybe, I know the community liaisons have been doing a great job,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3773.456s">[Tseng]</a>: But I'm wondering what are some of the barriers that you guys have faced and what are some of the ways that you're gonna address that with the Medford Connectors program in terms of outreach and getting to more people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3954.008s">[Tseng]</a>: You guys have been doing incredible work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3955.809s">[Tseng]</a>: Um, I really appreciate that answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3957.329s">[Tseng]</a>: Um, and, and what you were talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3959.35s">[Tseng]</a>: And I think, um, I think the work you guys are doing, I think, um, lays out a foundation for what other departments in the city can, um, can do, including the city council, maybe in the further future, maybe I think you guys are testing the waters, seeing what works and perhaps in the future, um, our city council and other branches of government, uh, other departments of the government can look towards you guys and see,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3982.603s">[Tseng]</a>: what we can do to be more inclusive to get more of those voices that haven't been included in city government to help us come to our meetings and help us, you know, give us feedback and shape our agendas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3994.39s">[Tseng]</a>: So that's helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3995.59s">[Tseng]</a>: I think my question was slightly, slightly more about how are we reaching the residents that we haven't reached yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4002.524s">[Tseng]</a>: which I know can be a really difficult question to answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4005.065s">[Tseng]</a>: And I'm sure you guys are already working on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4007.186s">[Tseng]</a>: I was wondering if you guys partner with other city departments to, you know, keep track of who comes in for city services already, or in terms of maybe a city, the work that we do collecting survey data with our city, city census type things, seeing who moves into the city, pays our taxes, perhaps there's a way to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4029.594s">[Tseng]</a>: even in, I know this can be costly, but putting even a short flyer in our water bills or something like that to try to get more people aware that your department exists, that the work that you guys are doing exists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4045.104s">[Tseng]</a>: And maybe that will reach more people, but you are the expert here, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4143.005s">[Tseng]</a>: That's excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4144.246s">[Tseng]</a>: And I think to what you've been saying,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4149.324s">[Tseng]</a>: as a son of immigrant parents, I've had to translate a lot of things, find out a lot of things about city services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4154.767s">[Tseng]</a>: It would be super helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4156.928s">[Tseng]</a>: The things that you're describing will be super helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4158.889s">[Tseng]</a>: So, and I think lay out groundwork for, you know, the work that we want to do on youth mental health, on, you know, making our community safer as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4167.493s">[Tseng]</a>: So thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8038.117s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you, President Morrell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8040.038s">[Tseng]</a>: I think it's important to thank first the teachers and the school staff and the parents who were there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8049.056s">[Tseng]</a>: who are helping the students through the ordeal, who themselves had to deal with emotional side of everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8058.219s">[Tseng]</a>: It's really important not to forget about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8063.101s">[Tseng]</a>: This hurts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8064.182s">[Tseng]</a>: This hurts emotionally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8065.802s">[Tseng]</a>: It hurts physically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8070.084s">[Tseng]</a>: It's important to deal with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8071.985s">[Tseng]</a>: And it matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8073.165s">[Tseng]</a>: It matters to all of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8074.265s">[Tseng]</a>: And look, everyone, everyone,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8078.74s">[Tseng]</a>: in this room, everyone online on Zoom is upset, is frustrated, is saddened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8088.383s">[Tseng]</a>: And I think we all feel sympathy for the experience that our students have had to deal with and continue to have to deal with at Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8102.648s">[Tseng]</a>: I will say I am relieved to hear<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8106.021s">[Tseng]</a>: that the student is in stable condition, but that doesn't mean that everything is over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8115.629s">[Tseng]</a>: I really appreciate the talk from counselors of all backgrounds about the importance of finding solutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8124.997s">[Tseng]</a>: And I think to that effect, I wanna thank President Morrell and Vice President Behrs for opening up the city council agenda to allow us to put resolutions on the agenda to have this conversation tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8135.86s">[Tseng]</a>: and to allow us to act fast and to allow us to have this conversation tonight, to have parents in the room and on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8147.068s">[Tseng]</a>: Look, school violence, and I've said this before, and it's in the news, there's tons of research out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8154.094s">[Tseng]</a>: It's an international problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8156.395s">[Tseng]</a>: It's a domestic problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8157.556s">[Tseng]</a>: It's a Medford problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8159.889s">[Tseng]</a>: And that actually means that we have to deal with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8162.691s">[Tseng]</a>: And we do have to address it here at home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8165.834s">[Tseng]</a>: It's not, you know, school violence has been around for a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8170.317s">[Tseng]</a>: Councilor Behrs has spoken to his experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8174.179s">[Tseng]</a>: I went to Medford High School just five years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8176.121s">[Tseng]</a>: I know what it's like there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8179.903s">[Tseng]</a>: And it is a wonderful, it's a wonderful institution to learn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8183.171s">[Tseng]</a>: there are, you know, blemishes on it as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8186.133s">[Tseng]</a>: And this work, these are all issues that school leaders, teachers, students, everyone has been working together to address over the last few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8198.624s">[Tseng]</a>: And it's evident that we need to put even more energy towards it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8202.887s">[Tseng]</a>: And as I've said before as well, until our schools are safe for everyone, for all, we still have more work to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8212.984s">[Tseng]</a>: We need to find sustainable solutions, and that means engaging stakeholders from students to parents to teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8219.949s">[Tseng]</a>: I know people aren't going to like this, but the school committee who have been elected to govern our schools, to oversee our schools, and we need to engage school leaders as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8231.156s">[Tseng]</a>: We need to enforce the existing policies on violence and on anti-bullying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8237.521s">[Tseng]</a>: and we need accountability to make sure that we're enforcing these policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8243.065s">[Tseng]</a>: We need to think through the actions that we can take to protect all kids carefully and quickly, I will add, but we need to make sure that they're equitable and reasonable and that they really truly do protect every kid in the classroom and in the hallways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8263.279s">[Tseng]</a>: I think it's also evidence that there's a major communications problem<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8267.938s">[Tseng]</a>: that we as a city council have been bringing up in the city, the communications problem in the city when it comes to not just in an incident like this, but just in general, getting the message out to residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8282.418s">[Tseng]</a>: But when it comes to this incident as well,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8287.143s">[Tseng]</a>: We need to know, and I think President Morrell and I have written a resolution to this effect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8293.986s">[Tseng]</a>: We need to know about the incident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8296.147s">[Tseng]</a>: We need to know the details.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8297.187s">[Tseng]</a>: We need to know authority and rules and who has authority over what.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8301.289s">[Tseng]</a>: And we need to prevent misinformation from being spread.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8305.491s">[Tseng]</a>: And school community members at yesterday's meeting have also acknowledged that as a city, we need to do better on communications and on engaging families as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8318.411s">[Tseng]</a>: Counselor Bares is right, the funding problem is real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8321.114s">[Tseng]</a>: It's one of the reasons why I decided to run for office in the first place, watching the budget conversation years ago, when we cut, we made major cuts to guidance and to mental health and counseling at our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8334.01s">[Tseng]</a>: And now we're seeing the effects of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8336.392s">[Tseng]</a>: Um, we need to, we need to be serious about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8339.993s">[Tseng]</a>: We need to be serious that about funding and to realize that there is a funding issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8345.095s">[Tseng]</a>: Um, and that, that, that effect that the problem is trickling down to our hallways into our classrooms and, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8356.289s">[Tseng]</a>: and that particularly after COVID and after remote learning, there has been an epidemic of poor mental health in the city and in this country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8367.2s">[Tseng]</a>: I asked the city and the city council joined me in passing a resolution months ago<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8374.987s">[Tseng]</a>: asking the city to do a general survey on youth mental health and to look at the effects of that and to see what we can do to invest more in it and to prevent things like this from happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8386.975s">[Tseng]</a>: And it is upsetting as a counselor to see that we haven't done enough on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8393.159s">[Tseng]</a>: This council has been responsible in doing that and we have been proactive in addressing youth mental health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8400.635s">[Tseng]</a>: I want us to do as much as possible, as quickly as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8405.038s">[Tseng]</a>: I think that's something that everyone behind the reel would agree on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8410.123s">[Tseng]</a>: But I also do want to make sure that we are creating lasting solutions within our purview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8415.567s">[Tseng]</a>: I know not everyone will agree with my approach on this issue and my ideas, but I am open-minded to hear more ideas, to hear feedback, both positive and negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8428.193s">[Tseng]</a>: And I understand, as Councilor Collins has mentioned, that many members of our community weren't able to make it to this meeting for scheduling reasons, for family reasons, and many members of our community aren't joining us today because they're afraid to talk and talking in public is not for everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8448.77s">[Tseng]</a>: And to those people, my inbox and my voicemail box and my text message inbox is also open to everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8457.253s">[Tseng]</a>: I think it's really important to emphasize that regardless of the tone of this conversation, regardless of the points that people have brought up, regardless of the feedback that we're going to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8467.383s">[Tseng]</a>: And I think people in our community, there are many, many different ways of thinking about this issue and about the solutions for this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8475.77s">[Tseng]</a>: I think that's been evident to me in the conversations that I've had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8479.912s">[Tseng]</a>: with neighbors, with residents, with young folks in the last 24 hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8485.033s">[Tseng]</a>: I think it's important to acknowledge the differences, but to also acknowledge the points of unity that I think we see on this agenda tonight, because those points of unity, those are the seeds, I think, for more lasting, more substantive policy changes in the future that will better, I think, create a school environment for our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12348.274s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12348.974s">[Tseng]</a>: Um, I also wanted to, uh, thank, um, the parents for coming up and telling you the stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12354.978s">[Tseng]</a>: And, um, I hadn't heard the story before, and I think president Morello, you put it well that even though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12364.707s">[Tseng]</a>: even though I was there five years ago, I think things have, you know, things are slightly different now and smartphones and COVID and all of that changes everything as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12375.172s">[Tseng]</a>: So it's actually, it's really helpful to hear that perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=183.953s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Behrs, President Behrs, for putting this on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=187.736s">[Tseng]</a>: If you look at the year of graduation, 2024, if you do the math and subtract four, you'll realize that these folks entered high school during the pandemic, during the early days of the pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=199.065s">[Tseng]</a>: I think it's a testament to their hard work and to the hard work of their teachers as well, that they've made it through and are going really spectacular places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=212.463s">[Tseng]</a>: If you look at the futures of our students, a lot of them are taking on great technical work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=219.471s">[Tseng]</a>: They're great students who are going to top universities in this country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=223.595s">[Tseng]</a>: I think it really highlights and showcases what Medford can be when we pull together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=229.101s">[Tseng]</a>: despite the difficult circumstances, despite unideal circumstances, we can still really make an impact on this world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=236.808s">[Tseng]</a>: So I'm really proud of these students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=238.95s">[Tseng]</a>: I know Counselor Behrs and I both had the opportunity to read a bunch of scholarship essays for a scholarship, and it was so hard, harder than, you know, than ever to choose scholarship winners because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=251.468s">[Tseng]</a>: the work that these students are doing in class and outside of class, their leadership in extracurricular activities, community service, giving back to Medford is really just remarkable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=261.036s">[Tseng]</a>: So thank you for putting this on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5882.529s">[Tseng]</a>: Councilor Sang, then Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5885.896s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5887.939s">[Tseng]</a>: As everyone I think in this room knows, this has not been an easy budget season, not an easy budget year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5895.187s">[Tseng]</a>: We knew about this for many, many years now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5899.975s">[Tseng]</a>: I'll be frank with you, this budget is imperfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5902.916s">[Tseng]</a>: As I think, as you acknowledge in your statements, and before we got your final proposal, before we got the additional context, which Vice President Collins reminded us about, I was ready to vote no on it if I was uncomfortable with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5919.72s">[Tseng]</a>: The additional papers that you've sent that have been put on the agenda, I think provide the context that I need to feel more comfortable voting for this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5930.245s">[Tseng]</a>: It's not enough, like you said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5932.426s">[Tseng]</a>: We need to do better by our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5935.347s">[Tseng]</a>: I ran on a platform that was mostly around increasing school funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5942.05s">[Tseng]</a>: It's one of the two core reasons why I got into local politics in the first place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5947.652s">[Tseng]</a>: As a student, I really benefited from a lot of the programs that we have been talking about for the last few months that have been at risk of being cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5956.132s">[Tseng]</a>: I'm happy that the ARPA supplement in this budget helps us keep a lot of those programs, or at least gives us the option to keep a lot of those programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5965.721s">[Tseng]</a>: And I think maybe even more importantly, the override questions chart a long-term stable path towards financial health for our school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5978.484s">[Tseng]</a>: I think that's really important to mention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5980.505s">[Tseng]</a>: I think you and I, we've had a lot of conversations about using free cash, one-time funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5986.347s">[Tseng]</a>: Sometimes we've agreed, sometimes we haven't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5988.507s">[Tseng]</a>: And to explain to the residents, a lot of our conversations go along the lines of, I'm trying to push you to spend more in free cash, and you're pushing back against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5999.911s">[Tseng]</a>: And I think you do actually have a reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6002.112s">[Tseng]</a>: I think it's important to tell the public that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6004.693s">[Tseng]</a>: When we use free cash, that's a one-time fund for recurring positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6010.058s">[Tseng]</a>: And we need to find a way to wean off of those one-time funds, particularly in order to keep our bond rating high.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6020.55s">[Tseng]</a>: We know that we are on a path to build a new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6023.273s">[Tseng]</a>: We have a lot of big projects coming up and we need better bond ratings to save money for our city in the long term for those projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6030.939s">[Tseng]</a>: And so it's reasonable to me, and it's not fun, but it's reasonable to me to use the ARPA supplement that you proposed and to pair it with the override questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6042.609s">[Tseng]</a>: I think oftentimes reasonable governance, rational governance, and responsible governance isn't fun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6049.955s">[Tseng]</a>: It's not sexy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6051.216s">[Tseng]</a>: It's oftentimes really, you know, forces us to make really difficult decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6056.161s">[Tseng]</a>: I think in those circumstances, it's really important to return the right of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6062.446s">[Tseng]</a>: those decisions to the voters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6064.207s">[Tseng]</a>: I think that gets back to the override question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6066.489s">[Tseng]</a>: I think we have to remember that the question that we're facing as a council today is whether we present these questions to the voters in November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6074.616s">[Tseng]</a>: We're not voting on the increase, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6076.937s">[Tseng]</a>: We're sending it to the voters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6078.679s">[Tseng]</a>: And I've always told the residents whose doors I've knocked on, whose phones I've called, and I actually got this the first day it was canvassing about four years ago in Wellington.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6092.89s">[Tseng]</a>: What would you do about a prop two and a half override?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6096.113s">[Tseng]</a>: And I said back then, agree or disagree with it, the most just decision is the democratic decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6102.258s">[Tseng]</a>: It's to leave it to the voters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6103.999s">[Tseng]</a>: I have my feelings on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6106.421s">[Tseng]</a>: I'm sure you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6108.483s">[Tseng]</a>: But it's the responsibility of the electorate to make that decision ultimately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6113.386s">[Tseng]</a>: As you acknowledged, it's a difficult choice for a lot of folks to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6116.889s">[Tseng]</a>: But I think governance is about making difficult choices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6119.711s">[Tseng]</a>: It's about making choices that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6121.673s">[Tseng]</a>: cause debate and debate is a part of democracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6124.595s">[Tseng]</a>: You know, we can't avoid it and we shouldn't avoid it because avoiding it is what got us here in the first place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6130.579s">[Tseng]</a>: The health of our city financially is not due to one budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6134.562s">[Tseng]</a>: It's not due to any one budget or any one council, any one mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6138.344s">[Tseng]</a>: It's due to a general approach that we've taken as a city for decades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6142.527s">[Tseng]</a>: We found ourselves in a position that's difficult to, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6149.161s">[Tseng]</a>: focus on new growth and have that plug in all the holes that we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6152.685s">[Tseng]</a>: And that is what our council is doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6154.467s">[Tseng]</a>: Earlier tonight, we passed our first step in our zoning recodification phase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6161.214s">[Tseng]</a>: And that's focused, like you said, on the new growth, on bringing in a larger tax base for our city so that we won't have to be forced to make decisions like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6172.646s">[Tseng]</a>: I've also always told residents that the override is the last option that we have to resort to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6180.657s">[Tseng]</a>: But the facts of the economic reality of the situation is that we've been cutting budgets to the bone and then some.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6187.023s">[Tseng]</a>: And I think this year's budget conversations really exemplify that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6190.987s">[Tseng]</a>: Our skeleton budget's been cut so much that it can't really stand up on its own.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6195.651s">[Tseng]</a>: I think that's why we need to make these difficult decisions and to pose these questions to the voters, to have them choose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6206.565s">[Tseng]</a>: I, you also mentioned, I think really importantly, this idea that our residents are demanding more, and I think they're right to demand more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6214.711s">[Tseng]</a>: Every conversation I have on the doors, you know, we're talking about problems our city is facing, and it's heartbreaking to go budget season after budget season, door after door, to tell them we don't have the money for that, we're working on a plan, but it'll take years for that new growth money to come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6232.162s">[Tseng]</a>: And, you know, we have to be realistic about the timeline of new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6237.034s">[Tseng]</a>: It takes more than one day for a building to be built.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6240.077s">[Tseng]</a>: And we need this money to plug the hole now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6248.066s">[Tseng]</a>: You've also mentioned a lot of the growth that is happening in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6254.246s">[Tseng]</a>: I'll push back a little.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6255.107s">[Tseng]</a>: I think we can be doing more as a city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6258.45s">[Tseng]</a>: But the fact of the matter, according to the Boston Foundation, we have, as a percentage of prior permits, Medford is by far the leader in the Boston area for permitting new housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6270.262s">[Tseng]</a>: That is something to keep in mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6272.744s">[Tseng]</a>: We are working on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6273.785s">[Tseng]</a>: We're not where we need to be, but we are working on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6279.42s">[Tseng]</a>: I think, you know, ultimately every budget conversation revolves around the question of fiscal responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6286.846s">[Tseng]</a>: It's not fiscally responsible when we're cutting budgets so much that we have city departments that aren't operating at the level that they need to be operating at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6297.873s">[Tseng]</a>: It's not fiscal responsibility when parents have to decide whether to send their kids to private school and to spend thousands on tuition because they can't get the specialists, the programs, the teachers that they need for their kids to succeed in our public school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6314.268s">[Tseng]</a>: It's not fiscally responsible when our firefighters are operating out of really the dilapidated fire headquarters on campus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6323.331s">[Tseng]</a>: in Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6324.432s">[Tseng]</a>: It's not fiscally responsible when residents have to spend hundreds of dollars every year, year after year, because our potholes are so bad that they feel like a roller coaster.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6337.832s">[Tseng]</a>: And the whole budget process in the last few years, this year has been calmer because of the collaboration, but the whole budget process oftentimes feels like a rollercoaster ride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6347.895s">[Tseng]</a>: I think that these override questions do stabilize our city a bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6352.777s">[Tseng]</a>: And they give us a chance, a fighting chance to not only succeed, but to thrive as a city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6361.362s">[Tseng]</a>: So to all the residents who are tuning in tonight, you may have the override questions, the choice is yours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6370.188s">[Tseng]</a>: But I ask you to consider one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6372.329s">[Tseng]</a>: I ask you to vote for someone you don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6374.771s">[Tseng]</a>: Vote for the kid who needs the literacy coaches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6377.773s">[Tseng]</a>: Vote for the drivers who need<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6382.315s">[Tseng]</a>: better roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6383.456s">[Tseng]</a>: Vote for the parents that need to talk to guidance staff, the school nurses, the arts, the families that need the arts programs to have their kids thrive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6394.464s">[Tseng]</a>: Vote for a future where our city<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6397.666s">[Tseng]</a>: shares and saves costs where we share our burdens and save money in the long run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6403.111s">[Tseng]</a>: And where our finances are more stable and where I can go to you, our residents and say, yes, we can work on that project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6410.959s">[Tseng]</a>: Let me get, let me get that done for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6412.981s">[Tseng]</a>: So I yield my time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6415.423s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Sang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16744.718s">[Tseng]</a>: This is a very, you know, happy occasion for the Caribbean American members of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16754.434s">[Tseng]</a>: There's not much I'm going to say that isn't repeating what Vice President Collins has already said, but we have a very vibrant Haitian community here, very vibrant Puerto Rican American community here, in addition to a lot of other Caribbean nations whose immigrants have come to America and called Medford home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16773.364s">[Tseng]</a>: This is in the spirit of making everyone feel and feel accepted as a part of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16778.847s">[Tseng]</a>: I'm very excited to celebrate this month with all of our neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=646.377s">[Tseng]</a>: Councilor Sang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=647.538s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=648.618s">[Tseng]</a>: Mr. Lincoln's efforts, I think, have really put the Brooks Estate on the map in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=654.961s">[Tseng]</a>: His work, people don't see it, but behind the scenes, he's spending so much time going to events, informing people about MBEL, about the Brooks Estate, giving tours to counselors, giving tours to the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=668.027s">[Tseng]</a>: His work, I think, will be dearly missed by, and the next person will have huge shoes to pull.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=675.796s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1082.38s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1082.74s">[Tseng]</a>: Councillor Sang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1084.782s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1085.202s">[Tseng]</a>: I really can't beat the city clerk's words, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1090.965s">[Tseng]</a>: Sylvia, I think you're the person I think of when I think of the clerk's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1095.088s">[Tseng]</a>: You've been there since day dot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1096.849s">[Tseng]</a>: And when I walk in and I see your smile and I see you at your desk, it really lifts my mood in my day, no matter how a meeting in City Hall has gone that day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1110.055s">[Tseng]</a>: go on, you know, family trips, I always make sure to bring something small back for the clerk's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1115.08s">[Tseng]</a>: And I always think that would still be appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1118.564s">[Tseng]</a>: You truly are the bedrock of the clerk's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1122.008s">[Tseng]</a>: I've heard it said that the clerk's office is like the front desk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1126.192s">[Tseng]</a>: for City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1128.033s">[Tseng]</a>: So many people interact with the clerk's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1131.575s">[Tseng]</a>: So many people come to you and ask questions about where to go in City Hall, where to find services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1137.318s">[Tseng]</a>: And you're always there with a smiling face day after day, helping our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1141.92s">[Tseng]</a>: And I think that service, that long career of service to our residents should really be highly esteemed and really highly celebrated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1413.959s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1414.4s">[Tseng]</a>: Councillor Sang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1415.5s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1416.701s">[Tseng]</a>: I think Councillor Collins really got at it by, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1420.205s">[Tseng]</a>: talking about how bittersweet it is to both celebrate the retirements of two lovely individuals, but also, you know, how much, you know, we'll miss after.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1433.452s">[Tseng]</a>: Janice is, you know, one of those people who really has helped keep the clerk's office running.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1438.595s">[Tseng]</a>: She's really, you know, as Councilor Scarpaoli said in the last statement, the clerk's office has really been,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1448.929s">[Tseng]</a>: the engines have been in gear through thick and thin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1452.35s">[Tseng]</a>: And Janice is a big reason why we've been able to keep moving forward as a city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1458.571s">[Tseng]</a>: So I'm so deeply grateful to Janice and to her service for all of our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1465.233s">[Tseng]</a>: Truly, she does so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1467.473s">[Tseng]</a>: Our clerks team is so remarkable and I'm gonna be very sad to miss both Janice and Sylvia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1696.758s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you, President Behrs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1698.36s">[Tseng]</a>: Mrs. Lasky was my fourth grade teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1702.464s">[Tseng]</a>: She is such a legendary teacher that even before I made it to fourth grade, she was the cool teacher that everyone wanted to be in her class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1713.554s">[Tseng]</a>: She did so many creative activities with students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1718.019s">[Tseng]</a>: I remember<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1719.7s">[Tseng]</a>: she used to run classroom elections, and everyone got really excited and involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1725.125s">[Tseng]</a>: And even if you didn't get a spot, I think you felt a buy-in into the classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1729.61s">[Tseng]</a>: You felt like you were part of a group of people working together and building a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1735.435s">[Tseng]</a>: That's something that she did so, so well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1737.537s">[Tseng]</a>: I think I remember<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1739.699s">[Tseng]</a>: It's so funny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1740.999s">[Tseng]</a>: I remember after a parent-teacher meeting that I wasn't at, she gave my parents really outside-of-the-box tips for how to get me out of my shell and how to get me more comfortable just making friends and speaking out for myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1760.583s">[Tseng]</a>: And those tips, I think, have carried through with me through the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1765.064s">[Tseng]</a>: And I hope I've done you well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1771.381s">[Tseng]</a>: Another, I think, amazing moment was when Mrs. Lasky brought in her husband, Fred, to teach us about the MWRA and to teach us so much about how the water system works here in Medford and why water conservation is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1786.87s">[Tseng]</a>: And it's small memories like that that I think really lead to the happiness of a childhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1794.434s">[Tseng]</a>: It's all those nostalgic memories that we look<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1796.975s">[Tseng]</a>: At least I'm looking back on a lot recently with all these retirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1802.7s">[Tseng]</a>: Mrs. Lasky, thank you for your service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1804.962s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you for your 25 years of service to the Medford Public Schools and for helping them since 2001.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1811.228s">[Tseng]</a>: You mean so, so much, not just to me, but to so many members of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1818.054s">[Tseng]</a>: I really want to both celebrate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1820.836s">[Tseng]</a>: this moment, and to say that I will be sad that when I go back to the McGlynn, I won't see you there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1827.098s">[Tseng]</a>: But I know I will see you around Medford, and I look forward to seeing you around a lot more often now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9004.219s">[Tseng]</a>: I just wanted to bolster, you know, you had mentioned that I think it's really important to say that we shouldn't mistake caution for support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9012.587s">[Tseng]</a>: You know, I think a number of us on the city council have been really cautious with what we've said in the last two weeks because of what our legal counsel and because what our policy experts have advised us to be careful to say in a public forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9025.779s">[Tseng]</a>: But I have, you know, encouraged folks to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9028.939s">[Tseng]</a>: make phone calls to me to discuss this issue, because I think that you'd be surprised to find that I see this issue very similarly as a lot of you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9039.289s">[Tseng]</a>: I came in planning to support, and I did, you know, by a 6-1 vote, we did pass Councilor Scarpelli's resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9047.497s">[Tseng]</a>: I agree with Councillor Berrios' comment that this wasn't the best location for this project and it wasn't the best process for the project, and I appreciate that Councillor Scarpelli put forward a resolution to help us reform the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9063.479s">[Tseng]</a>: There's been a lot said about the notifications and the transparency and the outreach of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9071.101s">[Tseng]</a>: I spent hours on phone calls last week with city staff, including with the director of planning, who promised soon a better outreach and transparency process, particularly involving the city council, so we can help get out the word better too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9087.064s">[Tseng]</a>: Something that we are meeting tomorrow night in resident services, the resident services committee is creating a user guide for city council to make our rules clearer and more accessible, especially if this is your first time coming to a city council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9100.451s">[Tseng]</a>: So those are just some points I wanted to bring up just to clarify and to bolster.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9105.314s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9108.555s">[Tseng]</a>: Name and address for the record please, you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13259.328s">[Tseng]</a>: Any other comments, councilor saying, um, I just wanted to thank you for your patience tonight and for coming here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13265.372s">[Tseng]</a>: So, you know, with so much, so many materials for us to review before the meeting and to look at during the meeting as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13270.676s">[Tseng]</a>: And for being so prepared for our questions, um, I don't look for at all, um, five minute walk at most, if not three minute walk,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13279.702s">[Tseng]</a>: I'm quite excited about this because I've always believed that our history in Medford is something that makes us unique and makes us stand out as a city even in such a historic area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13291.41s">[Tseng]</a>: I think Medford's history is so rich and to be able to protect it in the physical manner I think is so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13301.096s">[Tseng]</a>: So I'm happy to support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13303.198s">[Tseng]</a>: I understand that there are concerns to talk through and I would<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13308.121s">[Tseng]</a>: respect that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13309.421s">[Tseng]</a>: But I wanted to thank you for your work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16055.131s">[Tseng]</a>: I just wanna say I'm excited for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16056.992s">[Tseng]</a>: Councilor Sang, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16058.453s">[Tseng]</a>: I'm excited for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16059.494s">[Tseng]</a>: I think our community needs this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16060.895s">[Tseng]</a>: We need to assess our needs and the feasibility of a project that so many residents have been asking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16066.78s">[Tseng]</a>: Great, motion's on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17149.261s">[Tseng]</a>: Councilor Sang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17150.482s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17150.862s">[Tseng]</a>: And Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17152.423s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you, Chief of Staff Nazarian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17154.604s">[Tseng]</a>: Agree or disagree with the specifics of the plan, I have to say it's really quite remarkable that in my time following it for politics, this is the first time I've seen a free cash plan laid out for the next few years like this in such a transparent manner, inviting us as a city council to take part in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17172.133s">[Tseng]</a>: I really appreciate that effort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17174.214s">[Tseng]</a>: I think it really needs to be said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17178.136s">[Tseng]</a>: I think the plan also exemplifies the fact that we are spending this on one-time expenses, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17185.581s">[Tseng]</a>: This is the sustainable way to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17187.222s">[Tseng]</a>: I know Councillors have been reiterating that message all night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17194.063s">[Tseng]</a>: It also highlights the fact that as much as I've advocated for using parts of it on recurring costs to cover one year, if we followed certain proposals, we would just be pushing the deadline, the cliff off by a year, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17209.576s">[Tseng]</a>: And we need to make difficult decisions now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17212.959s">[Tseng]</a>: Very shortly, I think there are two core lessons that we've been hearing tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17217.54s">[Tseng]</a>: These lessons are why I would support this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17219.941s">[Tseng]</a>: The first one is being, you know, free cash should be used on one time expenses, rather than recurring because we can't count on them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17227.145s">[Tseng]</a>: We can't count on the number for the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17229.567s">[Tseng]</a>: The second lesson being that, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17232.731s">[Tseng]</a>: free cash needs to be certified, and oftentimes that process can take many, many months, usually until the spring, but we can't say for sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17241.073s">[Tseng]</a>: God forbid something awful happens in our city that we need that free cash for, we need to put money into the Stable Legislation Fund for us to take, to be able to cover that expense, for us to fix that problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17252.237s">[Tseng]</a>: And if we don't vote this through tonight, we don't have that money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17254.657s">[Tseng]</a>: So that problem could be left, we could be left out to dry for a very long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17261.989s">[Tseng]</a>: And I think one additional note for the city council is that this actually gives us more say in how the money is spent as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17270.592s">[Tseng]</a>: When we take money from the stabilization fund, the city council will have to approve that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17274.314s">[Tseng]</a>: And I think that gives us an additional level of oversight that we haven't had before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17278.035s">[Tseng]</a>: So I'm in support of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17279.536s">[Tseng]</a>: That's why I seconded both the BPAPE and the paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18003.269s">[Tseng]</a>: Councilor Sang?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18005.81s">[Tseng]</a>: I'm in favor of it for many of the reasons that Councilor Collins, Vice President Collins mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18011.456s">[Tseng]</a>: I was curious if you had any clear departments or positions that you had in mind for now, or if those is just like a proactive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19088.86s">[Tseng]</a>: Any further comments, Councilor Sang?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19091.243s">[Tseng]</a>: I have to say I'm still making my mind up, but to your point, if you're thinking about it that way, then we should recognize that the raised cost for the school committee is basically just a little bit over 2% over those last almost 20 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19103.055s">[Tseng]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19108.115s">[Tseng]</a>: it's off of a baseline that's much smaller, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19111.319s">[Tseng]</a>: And so it's still 2%, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19114.061s">[Tseng]</a>: And she's still doing whoever the mayor is, the mayor, whoever serves in that position is still doing those two legally separate roles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19121.69s">[Tseng]</a>: So if you're thinking about it like that, I would just urge you to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19126.369s">[Tseng]</a>: use that logic to apply if I don't know if I'm making sense to you, but I'm just saying the baseline, the base number is different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19134.271s">[Tseng]</a>: And so, you know, whilst we can say that the chair of the school committee did receive a raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19142.901s">[Tseng]</a>: we should think of that as separate from the mayoral role, because they are just two completely separate entities with two completely different salaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19154.328s">[Tseng]</a>: I'm just putting that out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19155.229s">[Tseng]</a>: I'm still making my mind up on it, but if I'm understanding your line of thinking, I would urge you to think that way as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19163.474s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=258.153s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=258.954s">[Tseng]</a>: Sorry, let me get the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=261.826s">[Tseng]</a>: get the audio working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=263.989s">[Tseng]</a>: I wanted to thank Councilor Scarpelli for introducing this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=267.253s">[Tseng]</a>: I knew Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=269.175s">[Tseng]</a>: Servini very, very well in my time at the McGlynn Middle School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=274.843s">[Tseng]</a>: You know, Councilor Scarpelli spoke a little bit to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=279.609s">[Tseng]</a>: how tough she was as a teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=281.27s">[Tseng]</a>: And I think, you know, if you just walk past the classroom, you would think that you would see the tough teacher that she was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=288.176s">[Tseng]</a>: But I think Counselor Scarpelli also alluded to the fact that she really was there for every student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=293.2s">[Tseng]</a>: She knew what every student needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=295.362s">[Tseng]</a>: You could ask her about any student and she could tell you individualized, you know, what her plan was with that student and how to get them to where they needed to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=305.03s">[Tseng]</a>: And I'm not talking about math only.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=308.177s">[Tseng]</a>: even though math was the subject that she taught, but I'm talking about learning how to grow up, how to mature, how to handle responsibilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=318.531s">[Tseng]</a>: And I think that's something that really stands out in any of our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=323.237s">[Tseng]</a>: memories of Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=324.258s">[Tseng]</a>: Irving as a teacher is how much she trusted her students to handle responsibility and to do adult tasks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=330.783s">[Tseng]</a>: How, you know, she would ask students to run errands for her in the building, to talk to administrators, to practice<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=341.328s">[Tseng]</a>: doing those tasks that seemed really difficult to a seventh grader.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=345.351s">[Tseng]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=345.972s">[Tseng]</a>: Irving will be someone I think Medford will miss a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=349.975s">[Tseng]</a>: And I just have this deep, deep, deep love for her and I send my condolences to her family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=355.939s">[Tseng]</a>: I wish her, you know, a happy birthday as Councilor Scarpelli did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=362.164s">[Tseng]</a>: And again, I thank Councilor Scarpelli for putting this on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=411.756s">[Tseng]</a>: Sorry, could you repeat that once more?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2452.564s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you, President Beres.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2454.785s">[Tseng]</a>: Lots being said tonight, and I think we need to unpack this resolution a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2461.914s">[Tseng]</a>: ultimately seems like there's a legal question and political question here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2465.317s">[Tseng]</a>: And the resolution put in front of us, and the way it was put in front of us, I think, presented it as a legal question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2473.545s">[Tseng]</a>: But the comments from the Councillor proposing this resolution tonight seem to have taken it in a political direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2480.412s">[Tseng]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2481.664s">[Tseng]</a>: You know, when it comes to that political direction, that political question, I think we've been very clear that we are audited regularly, annually by an independent auditor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2491.369s">[Tseng]</a>: And it would be quite an ask to take this one step further, given what we all know about the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2500.654s">[Tseng]</a>: Now, what the text of this resolution is, is a legal question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2505.657s">[Tseng]</a>: And that's how I will be making my vote tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2509.079s">[Tseng]</a>: You know, I think the rhetoric from some folks seems to want to back the council into a yes vote with some questions framed to get us to vote a certain way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2522.384s">[Tseng]</a>: But ultimately, because this is a legal matter, I think what truly matters here, the first question we have to ask is about the legitimacy of the allegations being charged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2534.748s">[Tseng]</a>: Is this a legitimate question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2536.67s">[Tseng]</a>: Is this the path forward, if that is the legitimate question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2540.734s">[Tseng]</a>: And why don't we just ask the AG for a legal opinion, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2545.899s">[Tseng]</a>: I think, furthermore, on the topic of legitimacy, let's unpack this one step further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2551.237s">[Tseng]</a>: I think we've been very clear that the council rules can be suspended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2554.879s">[Tseng]</a>: This is regularly, we do this at almost every single meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2558.802s">[Tseng]</a>: Now, I wanna speak from my perspective, why I've voted to suspend this, because I come from a different position or I actually don't know where my other councillors stand on this, but I don't think rule 21 is a rule that pursues transparency or accountability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2578.274s">[Tseng]</a>: Let's just take that budget meeting that we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2581.277s">[Tseng]</a>: Hundreds of people attended that budget meeting in person and on Zoom, expecting us to take those votes, the budget votes and the proposition votes that night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2592.952s">[Tseng]</a>: Now, oftentimes, when we suspend rules, when we table items, I get emails and phone calls asking why we've done that, why they haven't seen a final vote on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2605.557s">[Tseng]</a>: Residents first get confused, and then they get frustrated, and then they feel cut out of the political process because they don't understand what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2614.681s">[Tseng]</a>: They've taken this time to come to a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2616.922s">[Tseng]</a>: They've hired a babysitter to come in for that night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2621.698s">[Tseng]</a>: they're expected to do that two weeks later, to do that another week, to do that on and on and on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2627.721s">[Tseng]</a>: And that is not a fair ask of our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2631.482s">[Tseng]</a>: Now on top of that, the letter that the councilor sent to the attorney general and the state auditor didn't only mention Rule 21, but also mentioned vast general law, a certain section which I don't know off the top of my head, but has been said over and over tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2648.63s">[Tseng]</a>: Now, at our previous meeting, we read out that section of the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2653.473s">[Tseng]</a>: We walked through it, clause by clause, explained it, and it was evident from the language of the law itself that it applied to getting three vote items, or three items that required three readings, voted in one night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2673.479s">[Tseng]</a>: That's what that law applies to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2675.32s">[Tseng]</a>: It's not any willy nilly thing that we pass on to the agenda that shows up as a resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2682.102s">[Tseng]</a>: It applies to resolutions and papers that require three votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2686.984s">[Tseng]</a>: And that law gives city councils, it empowers city councils to pass those three reading items in one night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2695.632s">[Tseng]</a>: Now, that wasn't what the counselor tried to apply that state law for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2700.535s">[Tseng]</a>: We tried to explain that to my fellow counselor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2705.078s">[Tseng]</a>: And understandably, it was not heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2709.32s">[Tseng]</a>: But I can't change what the law says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2712.142s">[Tseng]</a>: The law says what it says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2713.763s">[Tseng]</a>: It applies to that very specific case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2717.365s">[Tseng]</a>: And so ultimately, this then becomes null.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2721.348s">[Tseng]</a>: It becomes void.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2722.388s">[Tseng]</a>: It becomes illegitimate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2724.269s">[Tseng]</a>: Now, I think on going back to some of the questions about finances and whatnot, if we have personal questions, and Councilor Lummi explained this at the last meeting, and this is what I do, and this is what I know other councilors do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2741.06s">[Tseng]</a>: If we have questions as a city councilor about the things that we are voting on, it behooves us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2746.824s">[Tseng]</a>: We have the power to pick up our phone, to dial a number of city staff and call in and ask those questions about our city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2757.793s">[Tseng]</a>: And that is just part of the political process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2766.143s">[Tseng]</a>: Now, if there was a legitimate legal question here, I would be happy to vote yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2770.609s">[Tseng]</a>: But we cannot go down the path of indecision and logjamming ourselves because of bad faith attempts to stall simple work that city councils have regularly done and regularly do, including the city council before any of us were elected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2786.594s">[Tseng]</a>: Now, if there was a real violation of the First Amendment right to free speech, I would take that as an affront to democracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2794.178s">[Tseng]</a>: But I think folks who tune in week in and week out will find that there is no shortage of free speech in the city council, especially from my fellow city councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2806.984s">[Tseng]</a>: I worry that a vote forward on this would open a Pandora's box of allegations and rhetoric and tools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2814.167s">[Tseng]</a>: The spying work being done in any direction from the city council and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2819.468s">[Tseng]</a>: You know, my hope is, especially given the events of the last few weeks, that we tone down our political tenor and tone down our political rhetoric to stop the finger pointing, to take a step back and learn how to disagree respectfully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6460.114s">[Tseng]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=142.165s">[Tseng]</a>: governance committee, October 9, 2024, paper 24-468, resolution to discuss updates to the city charter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=145.832s">[Tseng]</a>: This is...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=156.232s">[Tseng]</a>: This is a meeting on just starting the whole charter review process from the city council's end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=162.415s">[Tseng]</a>: I've prepared some slides, basically going through what charter review is, what our role in it is, and what types of issues we'll be thinking about over the next few months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=175.921s">[Tseng]</a>: I've also invited the members of the Charter Study Committee to join our meeting as well, although these are two kind of different tracks of work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=187.472s">[Tseng]</a>: I'm going to share my slides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=189.873s">[Tseng]</a>: Give me one second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=201.157s">[Tseng]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=202.277s">[Tseng]</a>: Cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=204.058s">[Tseng]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=205.939s">[Tseng]</a>: What is the city charter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=208.641s">[Tseng]</a>: I'm not gonna go through everything in my slides, but I did compile a bunch of information from the call-in centers, presentations to the charter study committee, mass general law and the state constitution in the slide deck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=222.388s">[Tseng]</a>: I'm gonna send it out to everyone after.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=224.129s">[Tseng]</a>: So we have one central place of information for the members of this committee and for the public to refer back to as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=232.586s">[Tseng]</a>: That way, we don't have to pour through different Google Doc folders of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=238.451s">[Tseng]</a>: Essentially, the city charter is our mini constitution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=243.294s">[Tseng]</a>: It creates our city as a legal entity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=245.656s">[Tseng]</a>: It establishes our city's powers, defines our government's operational structures, like creating local offices, distributing powers and responsibilities, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=256.883s">[Tseng]</a>: A little bit about our current charter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=259.544s">[Tseng]</a>: We have a modified plan A form of government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=262.824s">[Tseng]</a>: I put the definitions below.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=264.885s">[Tseng]</a>: Essentially, the plan system's not really used anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=269.526s">[Tseng]</a>: Our city charter's also spread across documents, which is kind of a hassle and a bit of a problem, and it has not been comprehensively reviewed in decades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=280.928s">[Tseng]</a>: Some reasons for why we're doing, why the city,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=285.819s">[Tseng]</a>: has been pursuing charter review, we want to be keeping up with a modern understanding of the best practices of local government, ensuring that our government's responsive to the needs and preferences of the current population, keeping consistent with changes in our state federal laws, values, cultural changes as well, clarifying any confusing or disputed text, and providing transparency on how we operate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=315.3s">[Tseng]</a>: You know, all of these reasons are why Charter Review is maybe one of the more exciting projects that we're working on this term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=321.152s">[Tseng]</a>: It's a very big picture project, and it's going to be all hands on deck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=326.514s">[Tseng]</a>: So, I think this part is important to let all of us know what the charter review process is like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=333.137s">[Tseng]</a>: There's essentially two main ways of doing charter review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=337.099s">[Tseng]</a>: One, I don't know if folks remember, the city council took a vote last term on a home rule petition to start the charter review process that passed 4-3 and the state legislature asked for five votes on that, which at that time we didn't have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=352.686s">[Tseng]</a>: The mayor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=354.758s">[Tseng]</a>: created a charter study committee, and that kind of leads us into the second way of doing charter review, which is by special act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=363.902s">[Tseng]</a>: And so special act as laid out in mass general law, first, there has to be a passage by majority vote at our city council of the text of the resolution proposing the special legislation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=378.45s">[Tseng]</a>: It needs to go to the state legislature to enact the proposed legislation, then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=383.652s">[Tseng]</a>: They got it, the assigned committee in the state legislature has to hear it, they have to approve it, and the governor signs it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=389.458s">[Tseng]</a>: Pretty standard process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=391.921s">[Tseng]</a>: Even though it's done by special act, it has the force of a city charter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=397.66s">[Tseng]</a>: So where does, you know, things like the charter study committee fit into this, um, for our charter review process done through special act, it's pretty regular to have a preliminary study committee, make proposals to us, the city council and to the mayor as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=412.409s">[Tseng]</a>: Um, that's what we're going to be doing over the next few months, reviewing the different, um, parts of the city charter that, um, proposals that were handed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=420.494s">[Tseng]</a>: Um, and oftentimes, um, a non-binding vote of the public is held on the proposed charter as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=428.709s">[Tseng]</a>: So substance-wise, forms of government, this is kind of one of the big questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=436.91s">[Tseng]</a>: You have mayor council as one major option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=441.071s">[Tseng]</a>: That's the current form we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=442.951s">[Tseng]</a>: Some cities have a council manager system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=445.612s">[Tseng]</a>: I'll give you the spoilers and tell you that I don't think the Charter Study Committee has chosen to switch a form of government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=453.853s">[Tseng]</a>: But if you're interested in reading the options,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=458.834s">[Tseng]</a>: Because, you know, we are going to be reviewing this, I've laid out the bullet points comparing contrast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=464.299s">[Tseng]</a>: These are from the Collins Center, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=467.141s">[Tseng]</a>: And then I have more bullet points for your own reference on other slides, if you want to look at the difference between the different systems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=476.71s">[Tseng]</a>: it's probably gonna be something we talk about too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=480.193s">[Tseng]</a>: There's also differences between a strong mayor or weaker mayor system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=485.196s">[Tseng]</a>: That's all done via like different parts of the charter and not necessarily by plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=491.101s">[Tseng]</a>: At least that's not the best practices now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=495.873s">[Tseng]</a>: So what does the charter establish for elected officials, kind of relevant to people like us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=503.019s">[Tseng]</a>: Term length, term limits, powers, duties, how we fill vacancies, compensation for elected positions, and the composition of the city council and the school committee, including the mayor's roles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=519.798s">[Tseng]</a>: some different, I know there's been a lot of talk in the city about ward rep, ward representation, so electing, having city councilors elected by district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=528.262s">[Tseng]</a>: There are a few different, you know, different compositions of ward representation as well, different formulations of, you know, how many people do what, what types of wards you have, sizes of wards that we have, sizes of districts that we're drawing for city council school committee elections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=546.669s">[Tseng]</a>: And I know the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=549.03s">[Tseng]</a>: study committee has looked at that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=550.952s">[Tseng]</a>: That's something that I think we're going to probably be spending a lot of time thinking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=558.776s">[Tseng]</a>: I'm not going to go through this, but the Collins Center has provided a generic modern charter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=566.859s">[Tseng]</a>: In looking at the minutes of the study commission's meetings and in looking at how to structure all these different conversations that we might have, separating into these 10 articles seems to be quite helpful, and I would suggest<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=583.246s">[Tseng]</a>: Just as the chair of the committee, I think it makes sense that we in thinking about how to set up a timeline, which is one of my goals for this meeting, we think about how like dividing it up into articles as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=599.02s">[Tseng]</a>: Um, and these, yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=609.071s">[Tseng]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=609.331s">[Tseng]</a>: The charter, the charter study committee's recommendations will use, um, this format.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=614.176s">[Tseng]</a>: And, um, there are, there are sections that will basically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=618.496s">[Tseng]</a>: be very, very similar to what the generic charter says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=622.9s">[Tseng]</a>: The generic charter is put, they've uploaded it into the Google Drive folder of the Charter Study Committee's presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=630.285s">[Tseng]</a>: So you can check it out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=631.326s">[Tseng]</a>: It's about 20 pages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=633.808s">[Tseng]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=634.229s">[Tseng]</a>: And it's like this, broken up into these 10 sections in this order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=639.233s">[Tseng]</a>: There seems to be some sections that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=644.062s">[Tseng]</a>: are really up to us in general, the public, to fill in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=648.704s">[Tseng]</a>: Some of them are much more like there is established practice for the language in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=658.929s">[Tseng]</a>: And then these are just some other topics that we might consider outside of the 10 drawn out in the generic modern charter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=671.462s">[Tseng]</a>: There are places for in the modern charter by they didn't fit in the column centers descriptions of each article.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=678.492s">[Tseng]</a>: So I just pulled them out separately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=682.037s">[Tseng]</a>: But yeah, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=684.082s">[Tseng]</a>: we will be looking at things like financial procedures and how we do budgeting in the city, how we rules for elections, citizen participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=694.844s">[Tseng]</a>: So petitions, initiatives, referendums, that all has to fall under the constraints of state law as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=702.546s">[Tseng]</a>: Periodic reviews of the charter of ordinances as well, looking at appointments, confirmations to multi-member boards,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=714.238s">[Tseng]</a>: seeing, you know, do we, who's appointing, who's confirming, is there confirming power there as well?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=722.361s">[Tseng]</a>: And public comment as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=728.124s">[Tseng]</a>: I guess the point of this meeting that I wanted to go after was just developing a general timeline we can work with and also developing any questions we have at this point for the mayor's office, for legal, for the study committee members as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=744.5s">[Tseng]</a>: or any general comments, too, to help us structure, like, because this is such a big project, how we're going to go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=758.332s">[Tseng]</a>: Could you jump back to the slide with the different sections?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=761.595s">[Tseng]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=763.517s">[Tseng]</a>: I'll do this slide first, and then if you want me to, if members want me to change over, I can change over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=819.781s">[Tseng]</a>: Councilor Lazaro?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=849.567s">[Tseng]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=850.188s">[Tseng]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=905.919s">[Tseng]</a>: Yeah, it's just such a big piece of pie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=909.061s">[Tseng]</a>: The question is how do we go about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=912.624s">[Tseng]</a>: President Paris.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1169.273s">[Tseng]</a>: I see Vice President Hollins has her hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1270.455s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1273.517s">[Tseng]</a>: President Briggs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1362.315s">[Tseng]</a>: from the chair, I think that makes a lot of sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1365.781s">[Tseng]</a>: I was thinking that it might behoove us to have one bigger meeting first to review the proposal as a whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1376.272s">[Tseng]</a>: And I think it makes a lot of sense that we try to bring everyone together for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1382.916s">[Tseng]</a>: I also am very much of the belief that we should hold a separate meeting for school committee and invite the school committee members with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1391.72s">[Tseng]</a>: I know there haven't been that many interviews in the last, I don't think there have been any interviews in the last year of electives for the charter review process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1402.006s">[Tseng]</a>: And so I think that's a very valuable perspective that we'll need to get people in the room for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1406.311s">[Tseng]</a>: And that includes the newly elected counselors as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1410.876s">[Tseng]</a>: So I think that makes a lot of sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1412.077s">[Tseng]</a>: What I can do is draw out a schedule, try to see what we can do over the next few months to have something to send, to report out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1423.909s">[Tseng]</a>: in March, so we can put that on the ballot in the fall, and we can set that as our goal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1429.432s">[Tseng]</a>: I think that makes a lot of sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1431.593s">[Tseng]</a>: I have also, if counselors want to get ahead of it because it's such a long document, I've also gone through all the minutes of the study committee, just compiling their votes and their recommendations that are in the minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1448.181s">[Tseng]</a>: separate and I separated it out mostly about article.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1451.003s">[Tseng]</a>: So I can send that to counselors as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1499.968s">[Tseng]</a>: It's not released yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1501.569s">[Tseng]</a>: Oh, yeah, the final report's not released yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1503.51s">[Tseng]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1506.805s">[Tseng]</a>: There are like individual motions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1522.85s">[Tseng]</a>: Yeah, I think it'll give us a pretty good picture of what the report looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1529.014s">[Tseng]</a>: Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1531.555s">[Tseng]</a>: Yeah, and I've kind of grouped it into, if they've taken multiple motions on city council composition, for example, I've put that in a bucket of its own, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1542.582s">[Tseng]</a>: Wonderful question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1544.603s">[Tseng]</a>: When I was procrastinating schoolwork.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1549.106s">[Tseng]</a>: It's something to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1550.407s">[Tseng]</a>: Yeah, it's a little bit more fun sometimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1557.634s">[Tseng]</a>: I said that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1558.135s">[Tseng]</a>: It's just a public meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1560.756s">[Tseng]</a>: It's just a public meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1562.037s">[Tseng]</a>: I'm just on record saying that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1565.519s">[Tseng]</a>: The clerk's just writing it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1569.041s">[Tseng]</a>: Sending it to Senator Warren.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1571.062s">[Tseng]</a>: Yeah, exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1572.903s">[Tseng]</a>: Bailey's gonna be really mad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1574.524s">[Tseng]</a>: Yeah, I think Bailey's gonna chew me up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1578.406s">[Tseng]</a>: Just a little burrito.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1579.827s">[Tseng]</a>: Just a little burrito.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1583.449s">[Tseng]</a>: Well, I think, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1585.565s">[Tseng]</a>: Do we have a second for that motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1608.49s">[Tseng]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1609.13s">[Tseng]</a>: Before we do that, I'll take public participation if there's anyone, there's no one in person, if there's anyone online who wants to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1618.385s">[Tseng]</a>: Seeing none, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1620.926s">[Tseng]</a>: Mr. Clerk, on the motion, on President Behrs' motion, seconded by Councilor Lazaro, can you call the, or voice, we'll take a voice vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1634.091s">[Tseng]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1635.511s">[Tseng]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1635.772s">[Tseng]</a>: All those opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1637.052s">[Tseng]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1638.673s">[Tseng]</a>: Meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1080.391s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1081.532s">[Tseng]</a>: I understand, you know, one of the council's main priorities going in before<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1086.736s">[Tseng]</a>: Knowing that this might be an option in the coming years was to maximize this senior circuit breaker for the tax deferrals and to push for the senior work-off program to get more of that done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1102.431s">[Tseng]</a>: It's my understanding that folks can find out more about the senior tax deferral from the assessor's office, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1951.16s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1952.182s">[Tseng]</a>: Sorry, Councilor Sang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1953.924s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1955.285s">[Tseng]</a>: Councilor Collins, I think, touched on a list of positions that, subject to the school committee talks, might be at stake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1961.532s">[Tseng]</a>: Literacy specialists, school nurses, guidance, mental health specialists, increased class sizes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1966.558s">[Tseng]</a>: You know, it's not fear-mongering when a lot of this stuff has already happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1969.261s">[Tseng]</a>: happening in our school districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1970.322s">[Tseng]</a>: We've already had to make a lot of these cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1972.343s">[Tseng]</a>: We've already found it hard to retain our long-term teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1977.166s">[Tseng]</a>: We also need to take a step back and look at this big picture-wise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1979.767s">[Tseng]</a>: We know when we invest in our schools, your investment and your value of your property goes up as well, that your public safety around you, crime goes down and public safety goes up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1990.673s">[Tseng]</a>: And so we, I think there are longer, bigger picture benefits to everyone, even if you don't have kids in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1996.737s">[Tseng]</a>: Touching on the roads real quick, because that's also a part of question seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2001.579s">[Tseng]</a>: I think we need to look at the opportunity we lose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2004.721s">[Tseng]</a>: Now, the basic role of government, of local government is to fix your potholes and to send your kids to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2010.384s">[Tseng]</a>: And if we're not, if we can't do either of those, then we're not, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2014.406s">[Tseng]</a>: we're not doing our jobs, but we were asking the voters to give us the tools to do our jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2018.727s">[Tseng]</a>: And something about question seven with the roads and sidewalks is that it would give us a crew that would work full time on fixing our potholes and sidewalks in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2028.07s">[Tseng]</a>: That's something that we don't have right now because our resources are too constrained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2031.471s">[Tseng]</a>: And that's something that I believe if passed, will show, will give our residents a real benefit, a real benefit that you can see and live in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2041.616s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you for the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3061.704s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3062.004s">[Tseng]</a>: Councilor Seng, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3062.924s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3063.944s">[Tseng]</a>: Touching very quickly on the topic of new growth, I think our council is very aware that new growth is the priority for Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3069.466s">[Tseng]</a>: And so when we look at the last three years of new growth, so the last two years plus the estimates that we have right in front of us presented by the assessor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3080.629s">[Tseng]</a>: It actually shows that our first round of zoning reform, which was the first round in almost 50 years of zoning reform, actually has led to the most new growth our city has seen in decades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3090.612s">[Tseng]</a>: We are currently working on round two of zoning reform and we are very, very optimistic that that new growth will help us achieve more financial stability going into the future as long as these questions pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3103.755s">[Tseng]</a>: I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3104.935s">[Tseng]</a>: I also have this chart right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3109.239s">[Tseng]</a>: I'll do what Councilor Callahan does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3111.301s">[Tseng]</a>: It's not really easy to see, but you can see that the new growth is growing throughout the last few years with the reforms that we've instituted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3121.429s">[Tseng]</a>: We are permitting more units as Councilor- Could you put that chart back up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3127.214s">[Tseng]</a>: We're also permitting more new,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3130.194s">[Tseng]</a>: new units than ever before, as Councilor Scarpaoli states.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3135.748s">[Tseng]</a>: Here's the thing, because on the topic of new growth, we're getting a little bit away from the why now question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3144.271s">[Tseng]</a>: We have a plan, that plan is being implemented, and the results are already bearing fruit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3149.112s">[Tseng]</a>: We fell behind decades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3151.293s">[Tseng]</a>: I mean, that's just the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3152.513s">[Tseng]</a>: We fell behind decades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3153.854s">[Tseng]</a>: And I don't agree with every decision that the mayors previous have taken, but we are in a situation now where we need<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3161.596s">[Tseng]</a>: to face the facts as they are now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3163.438s">[Tseng]</a>: High inflation, lack of new growth over the last few decades means that we need to do a short-term plan, which is these three questions, and then a long-term plan, which is investing in new growth, which is what our zoning efforts are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3179.075s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3179.495s">[Tseng]</a>: Councillor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4727.182s">[Tseng]</a>: two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4727.942s">[Tseng]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4728.402s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4729.183s">[Tseng]</a>: Um, I mean, continuing off of Councilor Lemming's points, those conversations are ones that we're having in public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4735.704s">[Tseng]</a>: I believe that there's an upcoming City Committee of the Whole meeting at some point that we're going to talk about some of how free cash is going to be used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4744.286s">[Tseng]</a>: I know the mayor submitted a paper to us with her proposal and asking us for feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4749.467s">[Tseng]</a>: That's all in the council records.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4750.888s">[Tseng]</a>: It's all online for folks to find as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4755.809s">[Tseng]</a>: Here's the thing about free cash, right, because it's a one time fund, we should be using it on one time expenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4762.219s">[Tseng]</a>: And that's why we're using it on things like roads on the light poles that President Barrett was talking about on HVAC systems and whatnot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4772.233s">[Tseng]</a>: We all know that these are real things that affect how we experience living in our city, affects our kids in our public buildings, and so they are very important expenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4781.242s">[Tseng]</a>: Now, added on top of that is the conversation we would have if we didn't spend that money right now, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4787.649s">[Tseng]</a>: Because if we defer maintenance, which I think everyone in the audience today<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4792.398s">[Tseng]</a>: acknowledges this has been happening in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4795.14s">[Tseng]</a>: If we defer maintenance, those costs go up as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4797.902s">[Tseng]</a>: And so we need to basically map out all of our uses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4801.464s">[Tseng]</a>: And that's why our city has been implementing our capital improvement plans, why we've started to take registries of everything that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4809.97s">[Tseng]</a>: that we're falling behind on maintenance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4812.874s">[Tseng]</a>: Our buildings director is really good with that work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4815.838s">[Tseng]</a>: And so that's why those funds should be allocated to things like that rather than being used one time on recurring expenses that we can't afford in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4826.092s">[Tseng]</a>: So I feel very strongly about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4828.113s">[Tseng]</a>: The bond agencies feel very strongly about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4830.953s">[Tseng]</a>: And in fact, if we take the free cash and use that free cash on recurring expenses, it's widely known that the bond agencies would lower our credit rating, as Councilor Callahan mentioned, and our costs for borrowing to do that maintenance work in the future would actually go up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4845.618s">[Tseng]</a>: And so that's something that would be an increased cost on all of us as taxpayers in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4852.336s">[Tseng]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6197.77s">[Tseng]</a>: I'll be very brief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6199.492s">[Tseng]</a>: There's been only one Councillor here tonight that's asked the voters in the room to vote a certain way, and it's not me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6207.401s">[Tseng]</a>: not a certain number of other counselors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6209.002s">[Tseng]</a>: So I did say that we approve these because we saw that voting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6211.544s">[Tseng]</a>: So two counselors, but pay attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6227.634s">[Tseng]</a>: I am paying attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6228.895s">[Tseng]</a>: You didn't read the budget, but anyways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6230.876s">[Tseng]</a>: It's embarrassing, man.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6233.537s">[Tseng]</a>: I apologize for letting this get off the track.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6236.018s">[Tseng]</a>: The question was about, I think- It's not your fault.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6239.5s">[Tseng]</a>: There was one aspect of the question about the new growth and coming back to ask, the voters to ask for another override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6248.305s">[Tseng]</a>: And I believe the financial task force has been pretty open in saying that we believe that with new growth coming in,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6254.644s">[Tseng]</a>: in talking to the developers who are looking to develop on the properties that we're rezoning for and looking at the projects that are coming into our city, we believe that we won't need to ask for another override until that exclusion for that school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6267.337s">[Tseng]</a>: That's something that we, you know, are very open in conversations that we have with our planning department staff, with our assessing staff here in the city council chambers and in their offices as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6278.429s">[Tseng]</a>: And to the point of us, the fear tactic of us coming back next year, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6287.594s">[Tseng]</a>: There is one opportunity offered tonight where we do come back next year, and that's kicking the can down the road by using free cash this year, which would guarantee that we come back to this exact same position next year as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7451.05s">[Tseng]</a>: I'll be very brief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7453.253s">[Tseng]</a>: It's in state procurement law, and I believe that this is the process moving forward that we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7459.58s">[Tseng]</a>: you know, we can plan to a certain threshold, but then we need to find the source of revenue that we have to pay for that project before we move on that much further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7467.904s">[Tseng]</a>: And so that's where we are in the process is where at this, uh, at the step in the process where we're identifying that source of revenue for the project moving on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7476.128s">[Tseng]</a>: So it's premature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7477.408s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11088.702s">[Tseng]</a>: Um, counselor saying two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11091.525s">[Tseng]</a>: I'll be extremely brief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11092.946s">[Tseng]</a>: Um, because I think a lot of this is, has been said before, um, the way I view it is there's a question out there about why are we doing it twice when, you know, we need to do the basics and I, you know, question seven gives us the, the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11107.399s">[Tseng]</a>: ability to do the basics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11109.06s">[Tseng]</a>: Question eight allows us to think bigger picture and think about how we can improve the school system, not merely just matching status quo, but to exceed status quo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11119.746s">[Tseng]</a>: I think there are a variety of different perspectives on that specific policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11123.728s">[Tseng]</a>: That's why we're opposing it to the voters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11125.469s">[Tseng]</a>: That's why we're letting voters vote on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11127.431s">[Tseng]</a>: But<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11128.615s">[Tseng]</a>: we do need the money first to be able to engage in a real comprehensive renegotiation of what that school day looks like, of what programs we can offer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11139.239s">[Tseng]</a>: And this is just the point of disagreement between me and my fellow counselor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11143.96s">[Tseng]</a>: I think Medford parents and Medford students know that our schools don't offer the same programming the other school districts do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11149.713s">[Tseng]</a>: I think Medford parents, Medford students know that we're falling short and that we have a lot of programming that we need to catch up on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11156.974s">[Tseng]</a>: It's, you know, we have great teachers doing arts programs, sports programs, coaches doing sports programs, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11163.316s">[Tseng]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11164.396s">[Tseng]</a>: But the question is, are we where we should be comprehensively?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11169.717s">[Tseng]</a>: You know, we've already had to merge drama classes to cut offerings in the arts in the last budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11175.598s">[Tseng]</a>: The question is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11177.925s">[Tseng]</a>: do we stay there, do we keep with that, or do we expand our offerings for our children?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12587.6s">[Tseng]</a>: Great, Councilor Seng, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12589.08s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12589.78s">[Tseng]</a>: I just wanted to speak to the grant part of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12591.861s">[Tseng]</a>: I know, as President Baird said before, our city departments work very, very hard to apply to as many grants as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12599.323s">[Tseng]</a>: But I think when we think about applying to grants, which I'm totally behind, I think we should do, we should maximize it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12605.245s">[Tseng]</a>: We also have to keep in mind that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12607.125s">[Tseng]</a>: it takes a team of grant writers and grant managers after we get that grant to put that grant into practice and do all the reporting and counting that we need for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12615.428s">[Tseng]</a>: And so that actually takes a lot of staff capacity on the city hall end right now that we don't have that general fund capacity for either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12623.792s">[Tseng]</a>: So that's, you know, another, I think, reason why<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12626.533s">[Tseng]</a>: paying attention to like increasing the revenue for our city government is so, so important, because it allows us to eventually, eventually gives us the freedom to, to have people in place to be applying to those grants that make more money over, over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12641.365s">[Tseng]</a>: So it's kind of like a stone rolling down a mountain collecting dirt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12646.88s">[Tseng]</a>: I, another thing about grants though, is that oftentimes they're not over a long enough period of time for us to be able to retain the staff that we want to, as Councillor Callahan mentioned, like if you're a teacher, you want to make sure that you can stay in that position next year, that you're, you're having that job or else you're, you're applying to other jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12663.167s">[Tseng]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12663.928s">[Tseng]</a>: And I think that's the case when we apply for grants as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12667.749s">[Tseng]</a>: That's why, you know, we have great workers in city hall hired on grants, but a lot of them don't,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12674.512s">[Tseng]</a>: are looking for other jobs because they don't have that stability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12677.495s">[Tseng]</a>: And so we need to give our city that financial, in my opinion, that financial stability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12682.499s">[Tseng]</a>: On the points of competitive salaries, I think it's really important to also consider that our teachers are competing or our school systems competing with private schools as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12696.051s">[Tseng]</a>: And that there's this, there's a race to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12698.773s">[Tseng]</a>: to pay teachers more, to pay for diversity, all of that is affecting how our ability to retain our staff and to hire new staff as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12707.579s">[Tseng]</a>: That's not to mention the district-specific characteristics that come out in a union bargaining sessions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12713.063s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Strange.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12715.505s">[Tseng]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=530.553s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=534.276s">[Tseng]</a>: It was really, really hard for me to see this news this morning, because I think, just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=541.377s">[Tseng]</a>: From my own perspective, Larry's been such a calming presence here on the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=547.202s">[Tseng]</a>: He, you know, is such a good friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=549.744s">[Tseng]</a>: And I think above all it's that him being a friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=553.146s">[Tseng]</a>: I'm going to remember really well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=556.149s">[Tseng]</a>: The first few weeks of my term when he really was that part part of that team that like welcome to me and to doing this job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=562.854s">[Tseng]</a>: to making me feel comfortable to be myself, to speak up, to serve the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=570.258s">[Tseng]</a>: He really taught me a lot about who to talk to and, you know, who to ask questions to here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=577.042s">[Tseng]</a>: But it's even outside of that work, after our council meetings, almost every council meeting, him and I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=584.462s">[Tseng]</a>: And a few other counselors would stand around and chat, talk about life, talk about things outside of Medford politics, and then things about Medford politics, but mostly just about life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=594.547s">[Tseng]</a>: And I think getting to know him that way was a real, real honor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=597.889s">[Tseng]</a>: I wish everyone had the chance to spend that time with him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=601.931s">[Tseng]</a>: It's really, really difficult, I think, for me to speak tonight, because this is a friend that we're losing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=611.624s">[Tseng]</a>: and such a loyal public servant to our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=615.825s">[Tseng]</a>: A real mainstay of the city council, who's been here longer than any of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=620.566s">[Tseng]</a>: So I wanted to thank him for all of that service, for his friendship, and to send my condolences to his family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=631.069s">[Tseng]</a>: And may he rest in peace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=633.03s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Sang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=634.07s">[Tseng]</a>: Councilor Lemming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2189.831s">[Tseng]</a>: The questions have been resolved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2191.092s">[Tseng]</a>: I'm ready to move.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2192.294s">[Tseng]</a>: I've talked to Owen about Director Wartola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2195.746s">[Tseng]</a>: A little bit about the memos.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2199.269s">[Tseng]</a>: In reading the final National Grid memo and the KTL memo, I feel ready to move forward as a council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=250.921s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=251.381s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=252.882s">[Tseng]</a>: As we know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=255.546s">[Tseng]</a>: In the last few years, reproductive rights and gender affirming care, the rights to access those two forms of health care have been particularly at stake in our country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=267.218s">[Tseng]</a>: Particularly worrying is that even though we live in a state that does a lot to protect these rights, much of what we're seeing nationally is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=279.252s">[Tseng]</a>: requests for municipalities and states to carry out out-of-state orders, so orders that are not from our own state, from authorities not here, to arrest, to get sent information, to prosecute individuals who are seeking or providing gender-affirming care or reproductive health care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=303.919s">[Tseng]</a>: In the context of all of that happening in the country,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=308.562s">[Tseng]</a>: uh, Councilor Collins and I, as well as President Behrs, then President Morrell, and Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=315.108s">[Tseng]</a>: We had a bunch of, um, resolutions on the City Council agenda to have our committee discuss what we can do to best safeguard those rights here, um, in Medford, um, and to make sure that, you know, we're following Massachusetts laws, that we're executing Massachusetts laws, that we're not, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=333.356s">[Tseng]</a>: putting ourselves in a situation where we're forced to carry out the laws of a state that we don't belong to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=340.141s">[Tseng]</a>: There are a lot of different ways to go about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=342.423s">[Tseng]</a>: The main focus the last time that this committee met on this subject was focusing more on the police involvement with the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=351.849s">[Tseng]</a>: And so really honing in on the question of arrests and cooperation in that process and essentially establishing a non-cooperation<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=363.183s">[Tseng]</a>: process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=365.424s">[Tseng]</a>: Now, at that meeting, I presented a draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=368.906s">[Tseng]</a>: I think the feedback that I got was mostly that it looked like a good draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=373.108s">[Tseng]</a>: There were some questions that counselors had, some people that counselors wanted me to reach out to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=378.29s">[Tseng]</a>: So in the meantime, I updated the draft in responding to those questions, as well as reached out to the health care providers in Medford, notably Tufts and Harvard Vanguard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=390.576s">[Tseng]</a>: I believe Harvard Vanguard was the one that didn't have anyone getting back to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=395.681s">[Tseng]</a>: I tried a bunch of times, but I actually did have a sit down with Tufts Medical and their public affairs team, public policy team, and they were fully in support of us having an ordinance like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=408.352s">[Tseng]</a>: I think on top of that, it's worth noting that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=412.543s">[Tseng]</a>: I don't know if all the counselors received this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=415.624s">[Tseng]</a>: This wasn't sent to the council as a whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=417.285s">[Tseng]</a>: I know this was just on an email list from the top reproductive equity rights group in Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=424.448s">[Tseng]</a>: They asked that even though there are state measures in place to defend reproductive health care and gender affirming care, they asked<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=434.045s">[Tseng]</a>: municipalities like us to explore ways to stand up for reproductive freedom here in communities like Medford, particularly through ordinances and bylaws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=448.155s">[Tseng]</a>: And so this draft that we have in front of us is essentially an extension of that effort to ensure safe and fair access to reproductive health care and gender equity care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=460.57s">[Tseng]</a>: The draft that we have before us is a slight expansion upon what we had at our last committee meeting, particularly given the second resolution that you read out, which broadens the scope that this committee can work with, and in response to some suggestions from residents and activists in the area as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=482.211s">[Tseng]</a>: And so what I've done is I've<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=485.253s">[Tseng]</a>: basically recrafted this draft with provisions about their access to information, because one of the other problems a lot of municipalities are seeing, especially with regards to abortion care, is the popping up of anti-abortion clinics, which essentially what they do is they sell themselves as reproductive health clinics, they get<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=509.264s">[Tseng]</a>: the more vulnerable populations come in to use their services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=512.671s">[Tseng]</a>: They don't recommend them for the necessary health care procedures, including abortion, but instead<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=521.428s">[Tseng]</a>: preach a certain message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=523.489s">[Tseng]</a>: And this is of a lot of concern because a lot of this behavior is quite predatory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=528.631s">[Tseng]</a>: And so this is something that a lot of Massachusetts municipalities have started to take action on, to explore ways to put language in their ordinances about fair access, about seeing what we can do to prevent certain centers like this opening up, and to distribute good information, especially in conjunction with our Board of Health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=549.281s">[Tseng]</a>: And so essentially that's the draft that we just got that Clark Herbie's just distributed via email and in print to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=559.543s">[Tseng]</a>: I, I wish I had a chance to get to the sooner so we could review the language here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=565.525s">[Tseng]</a>: But I was thinking we could, we can take motions at the end, but I was thinking to move that counselors send feedback to chair Lazaro and me before our next public health committee meeting on the ordinance language here, as well as<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=586.906s">[Tseng]</a>: Well, I'll just let that motion stand there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=589.288s">[Tseng]</a>: And then I was thinking maybe we want to discuss who we want to consult further and if we want to send this draft out to anyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=655.138s">[Tseng]</a>: Yeah, I think that's a great question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=658.8s">[Tseng]</a>: Essentially, I've gotten a lot of this language from East Hampton, which is kind of the leading municipality on the anti-abortion stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=672.626s">[Tseng]</a>: I'm taking a quick skim through now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=677.323s">[Tseng]</a>: I think much of this is what they have regarding those centers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=684.749s">[Tseng]</a>: I can study that further, and then if there is a way to do that, I can integrate it into a future draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=751.981s">[Tseng]</a>: I have more ideas to bounce around just as a committee before I dropped any further language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=757.944s">[Tseng]</a>: But if people have comments on this ordinance, let's stay on this for now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=855.569s">[Tseng]</a>: I can give you my copy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=862.443s">[Tseng]</a>: Trailers are looking through the draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=864.104s">[Tseng]</a>: I do realize that I did actually about the few sentences on Yeah, I did find it so I can I can also redistribute a new copy an updated copy with that Yes, we can also just bundle or motions, yeah Okay, so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1144.362s">[Tseng]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1159.653s">[Tseng]</a>: I know the paper<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1162.349s">[Tseng]</a>: from President Behrs, then President Morrell, and Councilor Collins is quite broad policy-wise on what our committee is authorized to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1171.196s">[Tseng]</a>: I think this is just one way of thinking about reproductive health rights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1174.338s">[Tseng]</a>: I think there are other ways for us to consider, like, I mean, even things as basic as ensuring access to menstrual health products and bathrooms in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1184.846s">[Tseng]</a>: So I just wanted to put that out there as something that our committee can discuss while this paper is still in committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1191.598s">[Tseng]</a>: There's also another thing that activists have reached out to us about potentially drafting an ordinance on is, give me one quick sec.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1207.236s">[Tseng]</a>: a local ordinance to ensure pharmacy compliance with the statewide standing order for emergency contraception.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1215.701s">[Tseng]</a>: And I was wondering if that's something that our committee would be interested in discussing while we have this paper in our committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1224.586s">[Tseng]</a>: And if so, I can come back to the model ordinance at the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1279.258s">[Tseng]</a>: So I believe the state, um, the state action is actually via executive order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1283.061s">[Tseng]</a>: Um, and so it's just to make sure that we are, um, it's to make sure that we're aligning ourselves with the executive order, but also making sure that if that executive order is reversed one day, um, for God knows what reason, um, we still have the protection in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1395.092s">[Tseng]</a>: In that case, I'll motion for me to present some draft language for an ordinance before our next meeting to this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1408.357s">[Tseng]</a>: I think it fits under the second paper that you read out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1500.128s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1501.068s">[Tseng]</a>: For this paper, I just wanted to start with a broader conversation about the types of questions we want to be asking, the type of data we might want to collect with regards to this question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1512.672s">[Tseng]</a>: Because I know there's so many different ways to go about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1514.693s">[Tseng]</a>: I know there are a lot of concerns with costs as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1517.534s">[Tseng]</a>: And so I was thinking it might be good for us to just meet, talk about some general questions we might want to be asking, and then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1528.669s">[Tseng]</a>: either me or Chair Lozano, we can reach out to department heads and community stakeholders to discuss these questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1535.511s">[Tseng]</a>: We can also create a list of people we might want to invite to a future meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1778.393s">[Tseng]</a>: I think some specific parts were mentioned, but it was more of a general conversation that I was having, particularly with some moms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1788.297s">[Tseng]</a>: But moms in that situation where they need to take care of their newborns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1795.501s">[Tseng]</a>: But I've also recently talked to some people who are in charge of recreational groups in Medford who spend a lot of money on their own to bring in porta-potties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1807.64s">[Tseng]</a>: Um, stuff like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1808.561s">[Tseng]</a>: And so, um, they're interested in seeing what the city can do to help them shift that cost as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1815.567s">[Tseng]</a>: Um, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1962.996s">[Tseng]</a>: I'm not sure that Commissioner McGibbon or Department Head Hunt or Director Hunt are in the best positions to provide the answers to that question, just because I don't think there is that much data out there right now about the cost and benefit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1983.288s">[Tseng]</a>: The thing is we could go with a port-a-potty system, but we could also go with other models, which I know some other city staff have been kind of chatting about here and there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1996.816s">[Tseng]</a>: I think maybe if you reword the motion just to be talking more about city staff in general, that'd be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2003.039s">[Tseng]</a>: Cause I'm just not sure that they're the ones in the best positions to answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2006.381s">[Tseng]</a>: I know we'll probably want to loop in the rec department as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2010.583s">[Tseng]</a>: So director Bailey,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2012.188s">[Tseng]</a>: on that effort too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2217.751s">[Tseng]</a>: I'll second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2220.332s">[Tseng]</a>: Before we end discussion though, I just wanted to say, um, um, I wanted to reiterate that this is, as other Councilors have said, this is just the start of a long process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2230.397s">[Tseng]</a>: Um, I think right now, um, the question, there's a question of who has what information, what's the best way, um, to get all that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2239.502s">[Tseng]</a>: And one of the roles of the City Council that I see<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2242.803s">[Tseng]</a>: just even broadly, not just with this issue, is that I think one of our jobs is to bring together that information where we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2250.006s">[Tseng]</a>: And I know a lot of this information lies outside of city departments as well, so I'll keep reaching out to non-city staff, members of the community who might be able to help us get some data, get some idea of where our priority parks are, how much they're already spending on stuff like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2267.394s">[Tseng]</a>: So I can keep working on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2269.655s">[Tseng]</a>: I think my vision for this is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2271.966s">[Tseng]</a>: even if this is not the most feasible project in the short term, if we can collect that data and if we can put together a roadmap to get to a place where we can implement it, maybe even get to the point where we can craft together a proposal to present to the mayor during budget season, I think that's my goal at least with this item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2498.127s">[Tseng]</a>: Yeah, I'm totally in agreement about the equity point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2501.69s">[Tseng]</a>: I mean, especially with so many groups in our city using stuff like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2506.174s">[Tseng]</a>: There are groups out there who also just can't afford to have a resource like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2511.219s">[Tseng]</a>: I think, even once I passed that just bigger picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2516.244s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you Chuck for hopping on this call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2520.307s">[Tseng]</a>: I think government in general has a responsibility to figure out how we can lower the costs that private residents are spending on things as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2530.276s">[Tseng]</a>: And so, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2532.637s">[Tseng]</a>: If one recreational group is spending that much and another recreational group is also spending a lot of money on this, I think it does make sense for government to step in and say, we're gonna provide this resource and it's gonna cost all of us as a society less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2584.203s">[Tseng]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=414.334s">[Tseng]</a>: Councilor Lemming, if I may.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=417.396s">[Tseng]</a>: Yes, Councilor Sang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=419.757s">[Tseng]</a>: I was just going to say, I realized I had notes on proposed edits to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=426.587s">[Tseng]</a>: To the newsletter draft, I realized since I can't make it in person today, it'd be easier for me just to leave my comments as comments and suggestions for you guys to consider.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=442.051s">[Tseng]</a>: I also see that there are folks here who are potentially here for the second agenda item, which we will not be discussing details of today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=453.294s">[Tseng]</a>: I'm just going to give a quick one-sentence summary when Chair Lehmann calls for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=463.878s">[Tseng]</a>: I know, I just, it'll just take us like 20 minutes to edit and I don't want, it'll take us 20 minutes to edit it and I just don't want folks to be staying on longer than they want to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=527.482s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you, Chair Lemmy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=528.263s">[Tseng]</a>: Presentation is very generous of a word, as I told you, Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=531.945s">[Tseng]</a>: I really don't have much of an update for this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=534.527s">[Tseng]</a>: I'm still working through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=538.129s">[Tseng]</a>: I sat down with the mayor and our DI director, Francis Wojciech, recently to talk through their ideas and potential disagreements on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=552.019s">[Tseng]</a>: They are still reviewing the draft that I shared with this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=557.722s">[Tseng]</a>: earlier in the year with some potential edits that they have told me that they would want to make, but it's very much still in conversation and I don't have anything for this committee right now or for the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=578.571s">[Tseng]</a>: And I'll let everyone know once those edits are available, but they are currently not available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=630.412s">[Tseng]</a>: No, that's, oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=639.218s">[Tseng]</a>: Sorry, can you repeat that one more, once more?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=650.945s">[Tseng]</a>: I presented that draft to the DI director and the mayor as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=655.488s">[Tseng]</a>: And the DI director and I had worked on the same document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=665.657s">[Tseng]</a>: documents the director had put in some notes on potential discrepancy and that was sent to the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=681.526s">[Tseng]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=682.822s">[Tseng]</a>: Uh, but, but once the mayor sends back, um, any actual edits to the document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=688.165s">[Tseng]</a>: So right now there are no edits to the documents, no real edits documents that, um, presented to the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=695.988s">[Tseng]</a>: But, um, one air sends back to edits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=698.97s">[Tseng]</a>: I will share them all with, uh, with the committee and with the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=879.273s">[Tseng]</a>: Oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=991.999s">[Tseng]</a>: Excuse me as I just try to find the words for this one point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1016.158s">[Tseng]</a>: Yeah, that's a proposed edit to what's there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1019.52s">[Tseng]</a>: You can see if you prefer it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1021.522s">[Tseng]</a>: I just think it's a little bit more organized and more formal in tone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1027.987s">[Tseng]</a>: But I'll let the committee discuss it since it's a bigger edit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1044.879s">[Tseng]</a>: Cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1329.681s">[Tseng]</a>: That's a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1330.282s">[Tseng]</a>: I just wanted to note that I put in a few more, just small edits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1334.663s">[Tseng]</a>: None of them are really to the content besides there's something small at the end, the residents guide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1340.944s">[Tseng]</a>: I just kind of like spelled it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1343.425s">[Tseng]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1344.165s">[Tseng]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1371.117s">[Tseng]</a>: I think grammatically this is correct, but I yeah, it does read awkwardly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1375.78s">[Tseng]</a>: We can edit it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1385.749s">[Tseng]</a>: Well, as just signifies that two things are happening at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1390.232s">[Tseng]</a>: So we do expect the CRC's recommendations, but we can say to as we expect to receive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1194.754s">[Tseng]</a>: I find them in order, I moved to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2883.479s">[Tseng]</a>: Just wanted to thank our seniors for taking time out of their evenings to come here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2886.701s">[Tseng]</a>: I know it's not the easiest and raising more attention about this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2891.444s">[Tseng]</a>: It is an issue I've, I heard at the senior center last time I visited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2896.508s">[Tseng]</a>: It's an issue that I know the planning department has spoken to me a little bit about in our meetings about development in Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2904.133s">[Tseng]</a>: But I think it's really important to reiterate that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2907.515s">[Tseng]</a>: The, this is just the very beginning of the RFP process that will have to look at the projects that are proposed that come in, there'll be public, there'll be public meetings about it I think at that time we'll have to make sure that we extend an invite to the members of the senior center as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2923.219s">[Tseng]</a>: to make sure that, you know, what I'm hearing is that there's a need for parking, but it's not just the need for parking, it's a need for a transition plan while we do the development, the growth that we need to do in Medford Square as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2935.429s">[Tseng]</a>: And so leveraging things like the Atrius Hall parking lot, leveraging spaces that aren't open right now, I think will become an important part of that transition plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2945.237s">[Tseng]</a>: And I think part of that needed conversation with our planning department, and I know the planning department's already<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2951.761s">[Tseng]</a>: talking about a lot of these issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2954.443s">[Tseng]</a>: There can always be more community engagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2957.385s">[Tseng]</a>: There's always a need to balance our growing square, our growing revenue sources in the square with the lived reality on the ground as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2966.472s">[Tseng]</a>: So I wanted to, again, thank you guys for coming in today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2970.815s">[Tseng]</a>: And I know there are folks from the planning department watching this meeting, and I hope that that becomes part of the conversation too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3592.335s">[Tseng]</a>: Something I did forget to mention and I think is in the vein of in a similar vein is that something the city, the planning department and different departments in the city is working hard on right now and I sat in on a bunch of these meetings is, is the transportation task force, which specifically is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3612.418s">[Tseng]</a>: looks at transportation needs across the city, but especially for seniors, that's the main crux of the work that the task force is doing right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3620.844s">[Tseng]</a>: Of course, a lot of it's understanding where people are coming from, getting to, how people are getting to the senior center, how can we make that more efficient, how we can make that suit the needs of what seniors are doing right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3636.694s">[Tseng]</a>: And a lot of these questions, I think, are part of the conversations that that task force is having.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3642.957s">[Tseng]</a>: There's a survey out that the city's working hard with the senior center to push out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3647.418s">[Tseng]</a>: And I know because there are seniors here and seniors watching online, I just wanted to bring attention, bring awareness to that survey that's out there right now and to the work that the city's doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3659.983s">[Tseng]</a>: And so this is a good time for seniors to be,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3663.784s">[Tseng]</a>: coming to City Council meetings, letting us and different department staff know about those transportation needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4552.912s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4553.612s">[Tseng]</a>: I think a lot of this is reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4555.013s">[Tseng]</a>: I am helpful to the veterans living in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4561.276s">[Tseng]</a>: I would just ask if Councilor Lemming would also be okay asking for the financial department to give a little bit of input about this financial or assessing to give a little bit of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4574.023s">[Tseng]</a>: assessing to give a little bit of input about this as well, just to help us understand what this would look like for our residents in the next year, and what this looks like for non veteran residents as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6078.643s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6080.004s">[Tseng]</a>: I really want to thank NS Associates, our city planning department, and our planning committee for all the hard work that they've done on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6088.331s">[Tseng]</a>: I've sat in on a few meetings and I've also been paying attention to this process really rigorously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6095.857s">[Tseng]</a>: As I've said at many council meetings in the past, and I think it's not, I can't claim credit for inventing this saying, but Mystic Ave is the gateway to Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6106.926s">[Tseng]</a>: As we have two exits that basically one exit opening up directly to Mystic Ave and another one very easily accessible to Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6115.249s">[Tseng]</a>: For so many of our residents and so many visitors to Medford, Mystic Ave is the first thing that they see when they're driving through the city, when they're coming home from work, when they're leaving for work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6126.474s">[Tseng]</a>: We want to make sure that that corridor is as livable as vibrant and as walkable as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6132.098s">[Tseng]</a>: And we hear this from our residents as I'm counselor Collins mentioned in her spiel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6138.362s">[Tseng]</a>: This is something that we hear a lot in our door knocking, when we run for office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6142.745s">[Tseng]</a>: This is something that the city has held countless meetings on in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6147.928s">[Tseng]</a>: This is something that's highlighted directly in our comprehensive plan which reached out directly to tens of thousands of residents and received responses from thousands of our residents as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6160.06s">[Tseng]</a>: There's been tons of debates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6162.522s">[Tseng]</a>: For anyone who's lived in Medford for a while we know that this corridor has been subject to particularly heated conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6171.169s">[Tseng]</a>: And I think there's been consensus building around a vision for this corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6175.59s">[Tseng]</a>: And I think the community has really come around a vision for this corridor that's more vibrant, that really helps us generate business growth in this city, generate housing growth in this city, and generate revenue for our much-needed city services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6193.674s">[Tseng]</a>: I think it's really important to note, as the Council President has and as<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6198.915s">[Tseng]</a>: Vice President Collins has, this is the beginning of the next stage in the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6203.338s">[Tseng]</a>: And in my opinion, it's much easier to solicit feedback, much easier for residents to give feedback on a project that has already been laid out, that has more concrete details that has language that people can look at, instead of things that are just more conceptual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6220.006s">[Tseng]</a>: And I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6221.504s">[Tseng]</a>: I'm very grateful for this month's time that we have to engage our community about this process before the CDB meeting about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6232.993s">[Tseng]</a>: And that's just one of the, you know, one of the meetings I hope, and I know, where residents can give their feedback about the plan that this council is sending to the CDB.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6245.783s">[Tseng]</a>: I know the resident services committee has instituted more public participation and more public engagement on mechanisms and in the past, and I know, you know, we're still figuring a lot of stuff out but I'd hope that we can look at those mechanisms as ways to engage our community as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6264.669s">[Tseng]</a>: Again, I this is something that I'm enthusiastic about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6267.35s">[Tseng]</a>: I think that this is a real solid plan that ties directly in to what we all know our best practices for business growth for commercial growth for engaging the citizenry of our city and in direct plans to lower housing costs on the most economically measurable plans to lower housing costs for residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6289.096s">[Tseng]</a>: So, you know, is this plan perfect, I'm sure we'll hear a lot of feedback about it through the processes, but does this plan deserve to move on I think our residents are very ready to see some real action, instead of just you know all the conversation we've had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6303.748s">[Tseng]</a>: And so, you know, I think conversation has to happen I think it has to happen in conjunction with action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6308.311s">[Tseng]</a>: So again, I'm very enthusiastic about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6312.475s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8077.196s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you, I actually just wanted to ask more about that, so that helps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8082.277s">[Tseng]</a>: I was wondering, I know it's hard to give a precise timeline for the urban master, urban forest master plan, but I was wondering if you had any idea when we might be able to expect anything or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8757.457s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you go to counselor saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8761.581s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8762.182s">[Tseng]</a>: Um, I just also wanted to, I don't I don't want, I want to make sure the family gets what they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8767.748s">[Tseng]</a>: I don't want to stand away with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8769.13s">[Tseng]</a>: I'm just to help us understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8771.673s">[Tseng]</a>: Does the city currently own title to the paperweight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8812.727s">[Tseng]</a>: I see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8813.127s">[Tseng]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8813.567s">[Tseng]</a>: That clarifies a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8815.029s">[Tseng]</a>: And then I was just wondering, is the liability piece, I guess what's the difference between this and an easement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8821.395s">[Tseng]</a>: And then does the liability piece play into that about why this is the way we're doing it as a city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8853.305s">[Tseng]</a>: Great, and this is a slightly separate question, so we can keep it short.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8859.45s">[Tseng]</a>: I think it's noted in the memo that if we approve this, the city property may be used as a two-family as of right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8871.701s">[Tseng]</a>: Is that something that's not an option right now without approving this?<br><br>
