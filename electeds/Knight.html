    <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=15.578s">[Knight]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=88.665s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=90.086s">[Knight]</a>: It's with great pleasure that I'm here this evening to endorse Dean Bruno and his candidacy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=94.107s">[Knight]</a>: I've known the Brunos for a number of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=95.688s">[Knight]</a>: They're a long time Medford family, grew up in West Medford and Dean now resides up in the Heights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=100.35s">[Knight]</a>: He has over a 20 year career in law enforcement and prior to that he had worked in government for about five years, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=106.892s">[Knight]</a>: So I have absolutely no problem with this appointment and I would move for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=158.021s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, although I don't know the gentleman personally, I have reviewed his resume and it's rather impressive, and I'd ask that the committee move for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=218.684s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, yes, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=220.705s">[Knight]</a>: As noted, this matter has been before the council a couple of occasions prior.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=224.787s">[Knight]</a>: It's relative to some surveying problems that were had with the Winthrop Street drainage project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=230.389s">[Knight]</a>: It's my understanding that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=231.889s">[Knight]</a>: There is litigation subrogation that's in place relatively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=234.73s">[Knight]</a>: Am I looking at the right one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=235.69s">[Knight]</a>: No, I'm not looking at the right one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=236.631s">[Knight]</a>: 15-734.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=240.152s">[Knight]</a>: This is the DPW facility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=245.794s">[Knight]</a>: It was underestimated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=246.694s">[Knight]</a>: It was underestimated on the mitigation for the pollution underground, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=249.635s">[Knight]</a>: Yes, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=251.035s">[Knight]</a>: And we've passed a couple of readings on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=253.256s">[Knight]</a>: And I would move for approval on the third reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=254.717s">[Knight]</a>: It has to get paid one way or the other, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=256.357s">[Knight]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=462.085s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=509.432s">[Knight]</a>: Yes, Mr. President, it's my understanding that this is just a simple clarification of the existing outdoor dining license ordinance that's in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=517.299s">[Knight]</a>: There was some misinterpretation of the legislative intent that's been addressed through the language in this newly crafted zoning ordinance, and I move for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=511.069s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=511.99s">[Knight]</a>: Um, Mr. President, uh, this is the first I've heard of the city receiving a grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=515.052s">[Knight]</a>: Could the councilor tell us a little bit about what this grant is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=518.594s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Locren.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=609.467s">[Knight]</a>: Yes, and the vote is to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=687.104s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Dela Rousseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=689.886s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=691.312s">[Knight]</a>: 7 in the affirmative, none in the negative motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=6125.202s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, on page 223, there is item 17689, amendment B, Councilor Locksmith and Councilor Scott-Bell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=6127.483s">[Knight]</a>: I do not change the record as amended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1194.829s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1195.77s">[Knight]</a>: Um, Mr. President, uh, this is the first I've heard of the city receiving a grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1198.812s">[Knight]</a>: Could the councilor tell us a little bit about what this grant is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1202.354s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Locren.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1203.355s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=436.301s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=438.362s">[Knight]</a>: Looking back in the newspaper over the summer, I think if we all recall a police standoff up in Saugus along Route 1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=446.348s">[Knight]</a>: And what happened was the gentleman had made his way into a Dick's Sporting Goods up in Route 1 and got his hands on some firearms, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=453.152s">[Knight]</a>: And this resulted in a police standoff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=454.973s">[Knight]</a>: They closed down Route 1 for a number of hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=457.535s">[Knight]</a>: Recently in our community, we were very lucky to open up a Dick's Sporting Goods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=461.187s">[Knight]</a>: And this Dick's Sporting Goods is a great, great facility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=464.771s">[Knight]</a>: However, they do sell some questionable material that I don't personally support, which would be firearms, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=470.276s">[Knight]</a>: But this is in no way, shape, or form an attempt to push back on people's Second Amendment rights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=475.521s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, what it is is an effort to regulate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=480.168s">[Knight]</a>: The safe storage and sale and display of firearms, ammunition, and firearm accessories in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=486.709s">[Knight]</a>: You know, the cat's out of the barn, the horse is out of the barn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=489.05s">[Knight]</a>: We have a facility here in the community that's selling firearms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=491.731s">[Knight]</a>: I think it's incumbent upon us as a council to take all the steps that are necessary to ensure that we maintain that the community remains safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=498.172s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, I bring this forward as a conversation starter, a spot for us to jump off from a launching pad, if you want to call it that, for us to start this discussion and have this conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=508.317s">[Knight]</a>: Um, so with that being said, Mr. President asked my council colleagues to support the measure and move for approvals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=582.915s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=584.516s">[Knight]</a>: This paper here is paper 17752, which reads, be it resolved the city administration refund taxpayers all convenience fees incurred during the current fiscal year as a result of the online payment of tax bills issued by the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=597.704s">[Knight]</a>: And be it further resolved that the city administration take the necessary steps to eliminate or assume such fees going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=604.108s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I've run into several situations, gotten several phone calls, bumped into people that have attempted to pay their property tax bills online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=611.738s">[Knight]</a>: And when they go in there to pay their property tax bill, they are assessed a convenience fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=617.325s">[Knight]</a>: The last one that I heard was upwards of close to $50, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=620.849s">[Knight]</a>: And that doesn't sound too convenient to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=622.43s">[Knight]</a>: We're sitting here in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=623.731s">[Knight]</a>: We're asking robocalls to go out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=625.112s">[Knight]</a>: We're asking things to get posted on the website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=626.734s">[Knight]</a>: We're asking people to utilize technology more and more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=629.956s">[Knight]</a>: We shouldn't be charging them to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=631.357s">[Knight]</a>: We should be encouraging it, not discouraging it, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=633.859s">[Knight]</a>: So I'm asking that the administration look into this and to take the appropriate steps to either waive the fee, assume the fee, or eliminate the fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=713.109s">[Knight]</a>: I certainly have no problem with that, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=714.91s">[Knight]</a>: If we're going to take a vote, I want it to be an informed vote, and I want everybody behind the rail to be comfortable with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=719.894s">[Knight]</a>: With that being said, I'd be happy to even withhold the request until we have the presentation from the treasurer or the financial director, whatever the council feels comfortable with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=729.802s">[Knight]</a>: Again, I just think this is an opportunity for us to get... They can be simultaneous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=742.285s">[Knight]</a>: We can do that too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=749.567s">[Knight]</a>: That's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=750.307s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, my motion is to have it passed, but, um, you know, go to the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=754.508s">[Knight]</a>: But if the council has questions, then I have no problem, um, going along with whatever it is that it will take to make sure that this comes to fruition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=767.264s">[Knight]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=769.525s">[Knight]</a>: Did you amend it, Councilor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2576.523s">[Knight]</a>: report due here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2578.124s">[Knight]</a>: It looks like the next report for the university accountability ordinance would be due November, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2584.026s">[Knight]</a>: If we could mark that up for a... It's come and gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2590.529s">[Knight]</a>: So maybe we can mark that up to make sure that we get a report back from our code enforcement officer to make sure that there have been no complaints filed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2596.991s">[Knight]</a>: We can, Mr. Clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=861.345s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=862.325s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=863.606s">[Knight]</a>: I think we're all in agreement that we understand and value the importance of a bus shelter, especially at this location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=868.849s">[Knight]</a>: And the task that's before us here is how are we going to get it put there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=872.601s">[Knight]</a>: And Councilman Scarpelli made a great recommendation to send it to the MBTA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=876.124s">[Knight]</a>: I'd like to amend the paper and also have it sent to the administration, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=879.747s">[Knight]</a>: And I'd like to ask the administration to discuss mitigation strategies in relation to the number of mass DOT projects that are going on in the community to help fund this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=888.792s">[Knight]</a>: some impact going on with the erection of the cell phone towers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=892.195s">[Knight]</a>: We have some impact going on with the extension of the Green Line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=895.158s">[Knight]</a>: We have some impact going on with the development of the Craddock Bridge that are all under MassDOT control, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=900.623s">[Knight]</a>: And it's not unusual when projects are going on in communities that mitigation of this sort is extended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=905.487s">[Knight]</a>: So I'd also like to ask that the paper be sent to the administration with the request that they discuss mitigation with the MassDOT to provide funding or construction of such.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1137.982s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1138.523s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1138.783s">[Knight]</a>: Also where the MBTA is a quasi public agency underneath the mass dot umbrella.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1142.765s">[Knight]</a>: I think it will be appropriate to amend the paper further and ask that this also be sent to a state delegation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1147.008s">[Knight]</a>: So they're aware of the request that the council's making.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1570.726s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1571.727s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1573.948s">[Knight]</a>: When it comes to municipal aggregation, this is a topic that I think we've been discussing now for over a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1578.671s">[Knight]</a>: And quite frankly, the ball's in the council's court to determine whether or not this is something that we're going to allow the city to explore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1585.596s">[Knight]</a>: And again, I think the time to move forward on it is now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1589.238s">[Knight]</a>: Ultimately, the question is, do we want<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1591.209s">[Knight]</a>: to request the department head to dedicate resources to something that hasn't been approved yet by this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1597.394s">[Knight]</a>: We're asking a department head to say, start creating a list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1600.057s">[Knight]</a>: We may or may not adopt municipal aggregation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1603.66s">[Knight]</a>: And I think we're putting the cart before the horse, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1605.522s">[Knight]</a>: If we want to explore municipal aggregation, let's explore municipal aggregation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1608.284s">[Knight]</a>: Let's take the vote and let's allow it to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1611.647s">[Knight]</a>: But to dedicate resources to something that may or may not happen, I don't feel comfortable doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1618.003s">[Knight]</a>: the Director of Energy and Environment to start to begin to create an opt-out list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1622.204s">[Knight]</a>: So she's going to dedicate resources in her office towards something that we may not adopt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1628.226s">[Knight]</a>: So I think that this might be a little bit counterintuitive at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1631.547s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I'll have a difficult time supporting it this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2732.927s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Neistat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2733.848s">[Knight]</a>: So this is, Mr. President, when we met with Evisuos, one of the things that Councilor Marks brought up was that there's a memorandum of understanding that was negotiated for mitigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2743.814s">[Knight]</a>: And that this isn't related to that meeting then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2745.555s">[Knight]</a>: Because one of the requests that Councilor Marks made was that the items that were brought to the table and denied, we wanted to know what those were as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2751.919s">[Knight]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2752.279s">[Knight]</a>: So this is for the previous meeting, not the meeting that we just had the other day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2755.461s">[Knight]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2755.561s">[Knight]</a>: Sounds good to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2820.42s">[Knight]</a>: If I may, Mr. President, I think the best approach would be to send it to Mr. Zamparelli from Eversource, who's the government relations person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2835.101s">[Knight]</a>: I believe I still have the floor, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2837.263s">[Knight]</a>: I'm sorry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2837.764s">[Knight]</a>: I believe I still have the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2838.845s">[Knight]</a>: I'm sorry, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2840.186s">[Knight]</a>: So we negotiated a memorandum of understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2841.888s">[Knight]</a>: And as I understand the process, based upon my discussions, is that the Department of Public Utilities has approved the project's specifications in terms of the cost, the route.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2853.876s">[Knight]</a>: the stretch that it's going to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2855.477s">[Knight]</a>: And the MOU was negotiated between the chief negotiator and the utility company for mitigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2861.842s">[Knight]</a>: And what comes before us is the grant for access for right away to put the vaults in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2866.385s">[Knight]</a>: If we fail to approve those vaults, then the next step in the process would be that Eversource would appeal to the Department of Public Utilities because they're the ones that approved the project plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2875.992s">[Knight]</a>: And then the question comes as to whether or not DPU agrees to allow them to proceed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2882.063s">[Knight]</a>: And if they do, then the terms of the MOU, I believe, become null and void.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2886.088s">[Knight]</a>: So that's a concern that we have as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2887.55s">[Knight]</a>: So I think that that's something that we need to ask the city solicitor at the next meeting is whether or not the terms of the MOU become null and void if the grants right away aren't approved and DPU has to step in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4306.174s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4307.45s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4308.871s">[Knight]</a>: I can certainly agree with my colleagues that there are many needs in this community, and prioritizing these needs are vital.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4315.795s">[Knight]</a>: And that's why we get elected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4319.817s">[Knight]</a>: The redevelopment of the Carriage House and the creation of the Shepard Brooks Estates to be a full-fledged function hall was part of the chart the course plan that was presented by Mayor McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4331.623s">[Knight]</a>: It was the last item that came before this council as part of the chart the course plan, and the council voted it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4338.604s">[Knight]</a>: After the council voted the plan down, Mr. President, about a year passed and the members of the Medford Brooks Estate Land Trust came to the council and said, the carriage house is the key focal piece of our master plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4349.329s">[Knight]</a>: Regardless of whether or not the council supports the master plan, the carriage house is the key focus of their master plan and what direction they want to go in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4355.532s">[Knight]</a>: They want to utilize the carriage house in the area that the carriage house is on to make an economic catalyst for the Sheppard Brooks Estates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4363.326s">[Knight]</a>: And they came before us and they asked for this money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4365.087s">[Knight]</a>: And we had a committee of the whole with Paul Mulkey and they had people come in and they had people do an assessment of this carriage house and tell us what it was gonna cost to tie it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4373.19s">[Knight]</a>: And we had a committee of the whole on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4375.471s">[Knight]</a>: And that was all we had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4377.492s">[Knight]</a>: And now here we are, a winter's past, another winter's coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4381.054s">[Knight]</a>: And the individuals at Shepherd Brooks Estates are here before us again this evening asking us for $200,000 to shore up the key piece and the key component of their master plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4393.467s">[Knight]</a>: Regardless of whether or not we support the master plan, Mr. President, the carriage house is an essential part of the redevelopment of that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4401.176s">[Knight]</a>: The carriage house is the catalyst.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4403.959s">[Knight]</a>: The carriage house is also falling apart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4405.882s">[Knight]</a>: It's a disgrace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4406.683s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, any one of us could go up there and if we look at it, it's not a carriage house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4409.786s">[Knight]</a>: It's a shell of a building that's falling apart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4412.497s">[Knight]</a>: But that shell of a building does have historic significance, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4415.579s">[Knight]</a>: Week in, week out, we talk about historic preservation, demolition delay, historic significance, historic districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4422.723s">[Knight]</a>: This is one of the most historic homes, I should say, because we do have the Royal House, we do have the Peter Tufts House, we do have some very historic properties in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4429.066s">[Knight]</a>: But this is by far the most beautiful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4430.847s">[Knight]</a>: It's got 50 acres of land that surround it, and there are many opportunities and options up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4434.91s">[Knight]</a>: And I think one thing that we need to do is preserve the carriage house, because maybe, although we don't agree with the master plan,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4439.775s">[Knight]</a>: I think we can all agree that the Carriage House is a vital component to what's going on up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4444.176s">[Knight]</a>: There are many options and many opportunities for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4446.017s">[Knight]</a>: And we might have to go back to the drawing board on this master plan because the council hasn't funded it in the past and they may not fund it again in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4451.099s">[Knight]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4452.219s">[Knight]</a>: But what I do know is this, the Carriage House is vital to the economic success at that location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4456.861s">[Knight]</a>: And this evening I'm comfortable supporting a $200,000 free cash appropriation based upon the history and based upon the presentation that was given to us in the past, the presentation that was given to us last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4468.445s">[Knight]</a>: And quite frankly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4469.741s">[Knight]</a>: the vital need that we have in Sheppard Brooks Estates if we're going to turn it into an economic catalyst to maintain the carriage house, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4474.982s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, um, I'm supportive of the paper this evening and I move for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=200.716s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=202.097s">[Knight]</a>: I think Councilor Scarpelli has got great timing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=206.359s">[Knight]</a>: Just a couple of weeks ago, our zoning subcommittee met under the direction of Chairman Falco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=210.42s">[Knight]</a>: And one of the topics that we discussed in that meeting was inclusionary housing and inclusionary zoning ordinance, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=216.143s">[Knight]</a>: And I think it's the time right now is to really address the issue that we have here in the city of Medford or affordable housing or the lack thereof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=222.998s">[Knight]</a>: And one of the focuses that we've had is obviously meeting the threshold that's established by the state of 10%, but also retaining and replacing the expiring new stock of affordable housing units in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=233.705s">[Knight]</a>: This is something that I wholeheartedly support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=235.226s">[Knight]</a>: I thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing it forward, and I look forward to working with him towards a finished product.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=371.118s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=372.419s">[Knight]</a>: I'd like to amend the paper with a B paper and request that the administration report back to the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=378.25s">[Knight]</a>: What the process is for permitting fields at this point in time, Mr. President, usually it goes before the parks board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=383.415s">[Knight]</a>: The parks board meets once a month when they have a quorum, and then permits are issued.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=387.078s">[Knight]</a>: And I don't think it's the most effective or efficient process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=389.78s">[Knight]</a>: Here we have a recreation department with a budget of $315,000 annually that hopefully will be up and running sometime soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=396.966s">[Knight]</a>: And the way that we're permitting our fields I don't think is going to be conducive to the best use and the best possible practices that we can do at the municipal level, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=403.561s">[Knight]</a>: So I'm asking that the administration conduct a review of the permitting process for their fields and provide recommendations as to how we can improve that to maybe a weekly permitting process as opposed to a monthly permitting process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=412.743s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=569.626s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=570.607s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Nice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=571.54s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=572.88s">[Knight]</a>: I just want to congratulate Justin on taking over the family business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=576.501s">[Knight]</a>: We've seen his father in there and grandfather Paul before that, one of the great basketball players of Carpark history and Carpark folklore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=584.622s">[Knight]</a>: Justin, same type of business, same type of, just a new name?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=588.803s">[Knight]</a>: Just a new name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=589.663s">[Knight]</a>: All right, excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=590.183s">[Knight]</a>: Well, I wish you the best of luck and congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=704.742s">[Knight]</a>: President, I move for adoption of the committee report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=751.369s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=752.749s">[Knight]</a>: With a recent school place shooting taking place, Councilor Scarpelli and I were having a conversation about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=758.049s">[Knight]</a>: the tragic situations that's happened in America here when it comes to gun control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=761.314s">[Knight]</a>: And one of the questions that came up was, are we doing enough in our public buildings to keep our employees safe?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=767.283s">[Knight]</a>: Then this evening when we got here, it's been brought to my attention, Mr. President, that there was a little bit of a situation in our public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=774.322s">[Knight]</a>: over the past week or so, month or so, I should say, that's been brought to our attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=779.725s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, I move for approval on the underlying resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=783.307s">[Knight]</a>: I'm sure there are many individuals in the audience and they would like to come up and speak on the topic of what happened at our schools today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=788.649s">[Knight]</a>: We can keep them as separate issues and open that up to public participation and move for approval on the paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=793.651s">[Knight]</a>: And let me-.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3546.87s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much, and Mr. Belson, thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3549.692s">[Knight]</a>: I appreciate your being so candid with the situation and accepting responsibility for what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3557.078s">[Knight]</a>: With that being said, when will the investigation be complete?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3611.353s">[Knight]</a>: Superintendent Belson, now we have the STARS program, and what would the normal reporting process be in the STARS program if a situation like this occurred?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3748.448s">[Knight]</a>: I was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3749.588s">[Knight]</a>: I was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3793.568s">[Knight]</a>: And Mr. Belson, if this incident had occurred when school was in session, what would the response have been?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3808.577s">[Knight]</a>: In terms of identifying failures in the reporting system, I think that this has been opened up as a failure in the reporting structure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3815.581s">[Knight]</a>: And where's the biggest failure that you've identified thus far in terms of the reporting structure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3819.683s">[Knight]</a>: Is it between the cleaning contact crack to giving it to the senior custodian, the senior custodian not reporting it to the principal appropriately?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3837.805s">[Knight]</a>: And I guess the next question is, what are the next steps that we can hear from so that we can be assured that this isn't going to happen again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3884.684s">[Knight]</a>: Do you have any knowledge as to whether or not the school committee is going to continue to allow rental opportunities to outside organizations in our schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3890.508s">[Knight]</a>: Is this something they're going to be looking at from a policy standpoint?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3929.337s">[Knight]</a>: No, and I'm not asking for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3931.178s">[Knight]</a>: I don't want to see a knee-jerk reaction to address an issue in the community that I think needs a long hard look.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3939.402s">[Knight]</a>: And I can certainly appreciate how candid you are this evening, and thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3943.145s">[Knight]</a>: That does it for my questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3944.626s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5396.078s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5396.858s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5397.859s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I just ask that we request, um, upon the conclusion of the investigation, a copy of the investigative report, uh, the findings thereof and any remedial action that may or may not be taken, um, after the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5411.109s">[Knight]</a>: investigation is completed for our review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5413.59s">[Knight]</a>: If that material is not available to us for privacy reasons or whatever, I would ask that a presentation be made to a committee of the whole so that we can go over that and hear what happens at the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5424.732s">[Knight]</a>: We're at the beginning right now, Mr. President, but I'd like to come full circle on this and see some type of closure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5429.233s">[Knight]</a>: So I'd like to get a better understanding as to what happens once the investigation is over and what steps going forward are going to be taken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5435.994s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5436.857s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Dello Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8831.816s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, this evening the Subcommittee on Ordinances met to discuss an ordinance regulating short-term rentals, also more familiarly known as Airbnb or vacation rental by owner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8843.879s">[Knight]</a>: The subcommittee has put together a group of key priorities that we'd like to see drafted into an ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8850.761s">[Knight]</a>: Copies of these key priorities have been distributed to the membership as well as the city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8857.123s">[Knight]</a>: Subcommittee had voted to move this paper forward favorably to a committee of the whole With the request that the city solicitor put a draft ordinance together for us to further deliberate and discuss move for approval the committee report Paper 17 542 16<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8881.832s">[Knight]</a>: Oh, we, we, we, yeah, the 2016.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8893.4s">[Knight]</a>: We did that already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8948.217s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8948.657s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8949.697s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I'd like the record to reflect that I recuse myself from voting on this subject matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9267.432s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, the question that I asked the city solicitor was because we had an existing ordinance in place that exempted private clubs from the public smoking ban, how could the board of health pass a regulation that would be contrary to the ordinance that the legislative body had passed in 2007?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9285.525s">[Knight]</a>: So my question was whether or not the process and procedure was appropriate and whether or not the board of health had the authority to make the unilateral heavy handed action that they made and they do not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9294.861s">[Knight]</a>: This issue has to come back to the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9296.844s">[Knight]</a>: If we want to allow smoking in private clubs right now, it is authorized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9301.03s">[Knight]</a>: If we want to ban that, that is a matter that has to come before the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9303.834s">[Knight]</a>: It's a legislative affair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9304.996s">[Knight]</a>: It's not something that can be done regulatory, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9307.579s">[Knight]</a>: So my concern was that when this was implemented, it was implemented inappropriately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9312.529s">[Knight]</a>: And I think that the city solicitor concurs with my opinion, and I also think that his opinion wasn't requested when the Board of Health went forward and made this action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9321.651s">[Knight]</a>: So, in an effort to make sure that everything was done above bar, Mr. President, to be sure that we were in compliance with the law, I asked the question to the solicitor as to whether or not this process was handled appropriately, and whether or not the Board of Health had the authority to do it, because there was an existing statute in place already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9533.638s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I think it's also important to point out nothing in our ordinance requires private clubs to allow smoking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9539.842s">[Knight]</a>: And the exemption only exempts private clubs from the public smoking ban, but it doesn't say that they don't have the ability to police themselves either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9548.688s">[Knight]</a>: So I certainly understand Firefighter Brennan's, Captain Brennan's position on the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9553.411s">[Knight]</a>: I don't particularly care for smoking in places either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9556.353s">[Knight]</a>: However, my concern when I brought the question forward was whether or not it was handled appropriately and whether or not it was done within a fashion that was in the scope of their authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=360.0s">[Knight]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1706.614s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1774.48s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1841.455s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2098.067s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2265.031s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4562.069s">[Knight]</a>: No, I'd like to know why we still haven't received one copy of one Warren article since January of 2020, 2021 now, 2021.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4574.838s">[Knight]</a>: We have not received one copy of one Warren article.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4577.099s">[Knight]</a>: You sat here before this body and put a budget presentation on and we made it pretty darn clear<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4583.814s">[Knight]</a>: that we want this document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4585.475s">[Knight]</a>: This council has passed countless resolutions saying we want this document, yet your office has failed to provide it time and time again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4594.261s">[Knight]</a>: Now, Bob, I know you're new to the city and, you know, at some point you got to say, I'm not blaming you, but now I am blaming you because you sat here before us in June when we asked for this document, we still haven't received it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4606.949s">[Knight]</a>: The council has taken numerous votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4608.61s">[Knight]</a>: The mayor's office has said, refer it to the finance director in a response to this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4612.705s">[Knight]</a>: but we still haven't received it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4614.526s">[Knight]</a>: Why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4625.251s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, is this a for real story right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4628.833s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, literally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4630.253s">[Knight]</a>: After a year and a half of waiting for this document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4635.356s">[Knight]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4636.636s">[Knight]</a>: We've been asking for this document for a year and a half and he goes, what are you asking for now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4640.885s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, is this-<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4642.947s">[Knight]</a>: No, this isn't even about frustration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4644.288s">[Knight]</a>: It's about a waste of my goddamn time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4646.57s">[Knight]</a>: All right, that's what this is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4647.851s">[Knight]</a>: All right, it's a waste.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4648.772s">[Knight]</a>: It's a waste of all of our time to come up here and be pranced around like dog and pony.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4657.62s">[Knight]</a>: To be pranced around like dog and pony.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4661.564s">[Knight]</a>: They're not passed by this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4663.786s">[Knight]</a>: We've never voted on a Warren article in the last decade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4730.942s">[Knight]</a>: I want to know how much money KP Law has received in the past year, for example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4735.063s">[Knight]</a>: So I can take a look at the Warren articles and I can say, oh, geez, we have a budget in the law department that says they're going to spend $200,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4741.526s">[Knight]</a>: But I'm looking here, in the last six months, we've spent $1.7 million at KP Law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4746.127s">[Knight]</a>: Why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4746.747s">[Knight]</a>: And I can get ahead of some of these issues so that come the budget in probably, well, we'll get it, what, maybe June 30th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4753.089s">[Knight]</a>: When we get to June 30th for, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4755.404s">[Knight]</a>: July 1st vote, I might be able to have a little bit of understanding as to why we're in the situation we're in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4781.547s">[Knight]</a>: 2020. We're going to start there. You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4782.149s">[Knight]</a>: We've been asking for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4784.174s">[Knight]</a>: We've been asking for it for four years, but you know, in three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4791.869s">[Knight]</a>: And I'm sorry to take my frustration out on you, but there's a mayor in this, there's a mayor in this building, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4796.911s">[Knight]</a>: And we send these papers to her and they just sit there and they don't move.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4800.473s">[Knight]</a>: They just sit on the desk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4801.353s">[Knight]</a>: All right, so I show up here and I try to do my job as hard as I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4805.575s">[Knight]</a>: I try, I really do, but I can't do it if I don't have the tools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4808.796s">[Knight]</a>: I can't build a house with a saw.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4835.242s">[Knight]</a>: Has the mayor's office ever called you and said, this is what they're looking for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4836.403s">[Knight]</a>: Has the chief of staff ever called you and said, this is what they're looking for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4844.15s">[Knight]</a>: Has the law department ever called you and said, the city council has asked us to draft an ordinance<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4849.991s">[Knight]</a>: This is what they're looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4853.112s">[Knight]</a>: So the law department hasn't called you, the chief of staff hasn't called you, and the mayor's office hasn't called you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4857.173s">[Knight]</a>: But this council's taking at least a dozen affirmative votes to get this information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4867.315s">[Knight]</a>: But then tonight, we have a paper before us to create another new job and give somebody else another raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4874.297s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, come on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4888.826s">[Knight]</a>: I feel bad that they sent you out here to fall on your sword to be a sacrificial lamb.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4994.725s">[Knight]</a>: out of this account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5092.201s">[Knight]</a>: It might also be helpful to go talk to the city clerk and say, hey, can I see a copy of the council tracking sheet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5097.944s">[Knight]</a>: It says finance director, because there's probably literally 40 requests that we're looking for out of your office over the course of the last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5340.994s">[Knight]</a>: I'm just curious if a rank and file employee say in the Medford DPW for a year and a half failed to provide you with information that you requested, what would happen to them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5359.224s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not sure I understand what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5370.205s">[Knight]</a>: even when it's clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5827.068s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6772.423s">[Knight]</a>: First of all, I'd like to thank Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Caraviello for being outspoken in their efforts to raise awareness as to what's going on in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6785.832s">[Knight]</a>: Neither one of these gentlemen were required to appear for the school committee meeting last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6791.836s">[Knight]</a>: They did so as concerned parents, grandparents, and public servants here in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6800.981s">[Knight]</a>: And when I listen to what they say, and I listen to what people on the street say, and when I listen to what my kids say, and I listen to what my wife has to say about these public schools as an educator at 25 years in a neighboring school district, it doesn't make me feel good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6820.226s">[Knight]</a>: It doesn't make me feel good at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6823.567s">[Knight]</a>: I feel as though we're failing our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6827.435s">[Knight]</a>: We're feeling the most vulnerable members of our population, our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6834.877s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli made a good point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6837.657s">[Knight]</a>: He said, it's the one-year anniversary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6840.018s">[Knight]</a>: I said, one-year anniversary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6840.958s">[Knight]</a>: Are you talking one-year anniversary or what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6843.419s">[Knight]</a>: One-year anniversary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6844.119s">[Knight]</a>: It's December.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6845.479s">[Knight]</a>: Christmas hasn't happened yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6846.439s">[Knight]</a>: I go, one-year anniversary or what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6848.22s">[Knight]</a>: He goes, no, you don't remember the two walkouts that happened last year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6854.261s">[Knight]</a>: The two walkouts at Medford High School that happened last year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6857.717s">[Knight]</a>: because of escalating violence in our public schools, when hundreds of children, hundreds of our students, our kids, our neighbors' children, our families got up out of their seats and they walked out of the school because they said, we can't take it anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6873.707s">[Knight]</a>: We've had enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6877.65s">[Knight]</a>: Here we are exactly one year later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6881.272s">[Knight]</a>: I don't think we're in a better place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6884.114s">[Knight]</a>: I think we're in a worse place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6887.27s">[Knight]</a>: I think we're in a worse place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6891.293s">[Knight]</a>: We're in a place where parents are shut out, don't have the opportunity to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6897.538s">[Knight]</a>: We're in a place where our kids are afraid to go to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6900.86s">[Knight]</a>: And I think we all know what happens when kids become afraid to go to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6905.904s">[Knight]</a>: We've all seen the documentaries on how gangs are formed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6909.187s">[Knight]</a>: We've all heard the stories about kids that get bullied in school and then decide to bring weapons because they've had enough and shoot up schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6919.292s">[Knight]</a>: We've all seen this, it's happened in neighboring states.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6923.034s">[Knight]</a>: Why do we feel as though we're impervious to the same situation or the same circumstances?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6929.159s">[Knight]</a>: Because we're not, we're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6932.861s">[Knight]</a>: So we're in a place where kids are afraid to go to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6936.303s">[Knight]</a>: And we're also in a place where we see embarrassing news story after embarrassing news story after embarrassing news story in the headlines with the word mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6947.52s">[Knight]</a>: And that's a shame because the city is better than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6950.822s">[Knight]</a>: The city is better than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6953.483s">[Knight]</a>: And our kids deserve better than what they're getting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6959.547s">[Knight]</a>: There's no accountability that shows it shows in this culture that's permeating our school system is transcending into the classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6971.854s">[Knight]</a>: And we can all sit here and we can say, this isn't right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6973.575s">[Knight]</a>: And this isn't wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6975.336s">[Knight]</a>: but the data doesn't lie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6976.677s">[Knight]</a>: The numbers don't lie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6978.337s">[Knight]</a>: So let's talk about the numbers a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6980.998s">[Knight]</a>: Let's talk about the numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6983.259s">[Knight]</a>: 42% proficiency in math, 50% proficiency in reading, 240th in the state college readiness index, 181st in graduation rate, and 184th overall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6999.125s">[Knight]</a>: Our kids deserve better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7001.226s">[Knight]</a>: Our kids deserve better than what they're getting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7003.493s">[Knight]</a>: They don't deserve to go to school afraid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7006.414s">[Knight]</a>: They deserve to go to school with leaders that are willing to step up and accept the challenge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7013.436s">[Knight]</a>: Now, when this incident first happened, I got an email and the email spoke volumes in terms of the culture that's going on with this administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7024.199s">[Knight]</a>: And I have to take a look at it and just mention it because I think it really speaks volumes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7031.361s">[Knight]</a>: If I can find it and remember how to work this thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7046.083s">[Knight]</a>: This is a confidential and urgent update relative to the circumstances at Medford High School from Dr. Maurice Edouard-Vincent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7054.208s">[Knight]</a>: MHS is currently in a stay-in-place due to a medical emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7059.864s">[Knight]</a>: A student was stabbed in the restroom and transported to MGH.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7062.785s">[Knight]</a>: Four students have been identified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7064.866s">[Knight]</a>: The police are here working with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7066.167s">[Knight]</a>: We're working on an official communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7069.429s">[Knight]</a>: What's that mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7070.769s">[Knight]</a>: We're working on an official communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7073.35s">[Knight]</a>: You shouldn't have to work on facts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7074.911s">[Knight]</a>: You shouldn't have to work on truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7076.732s">[Knight]</a>: You shouldn't have to work on anything other than telling the people what happened and what you're going to do to prevent it from happening again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7082.855s">[Knight]</a>: Here we are 60 days ago, two short months ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7088.057s">[Knight]</a>: Two short months ago, a girl was assaulted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7090.387s">[Knight]</a>: terribly assaulted, captured on video, broadcast all across the local news stations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7096.532s">[Knight]</a>: This poor girl has to go to school every day, shaking in her boots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7099.675s">[Knight]</a>: If it weren't for the strength of her parents, if it weren't for the strength of her parents coming up here week after week, day after day, fighting to raise awareness about these issues, it would have gone away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7113.966s">[Knight]</a>: And then 60 days later, we would have been talking about this gentleman that got assaulted and stabbed, and then it would have gone away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7121.104s">[Knight]</a>: And then 60 days later, something else would happen and we'd bring it up again and we'd start talking about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7126.806s">[Knight]</a>: Let's get serious about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7128.166s">[Knight]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7128.967s">[Knight]</a>: It's been a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7130.147s">[Knight]</a>: It's been a year since the students in that school told us they've had enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7134.008s">[Knight]</a>: It's been a year since they all got up out of their desks and had the courage to walk out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7137.81s">[Knight]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7138.81s">[Knight]</a>: They had more courage than the adults in the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7147.053s">[Knight]</a>: And now they have to have more courage than the adults in the building to go to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7150.558s">[Knight]</a>: because they're scared for their safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7153.78s">[Knight]</a>: This is sickening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7155.402s">[Knight]</a>: This is sickening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7156.783s">[Knight]</a>: And nothing anybody can say when they come up to this podium, all right, is gonna change the way I feel about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7162.948s">[Knight]</a>: The way it's been handled is horrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7165.369s">[Knight]</a>: Horrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7165.83s">[Knight]</a>: These aren't isolated incidents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7168.092s">[Knight]</a>: A year ago, one year ago, the whole school said we've had enough and they walked out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7172.975s">[Knight]</a>: This is not an isolated incident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7176.178s">[Knight]</a>: And the longer we keep approaching this situation as an isolated incident,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7181.069s">[Knight]</a>: The more isolated incidents are going to occur.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7185.572s">[Knight]</a>: And then when the budget comes around, we're going to hear the school department cry poor mouth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7189.694s">[Knight]</a>: Well, everybody wants to go to Minuteman and everybody wants to go to the charter school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7193.156s">[Knight]</a>: Well, yeah, no kidding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7194.457s">[Knight]</a>: Why wouldn't they?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7196.558s">[Knight]</a>: You're going to sign your kid up for karate when they're five years old just to go to Medford High.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7204.003s">[Knight]</a>: You can pay one way or you can pay the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7207.165s">[Knight]</a>: You can pay with peace of mind and financially send them to a school<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7211.374s">[Knight]</a>: where you feel as though they're going to be safe and you're going to receive what you deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7217.459s">[Knight]</a>: Or you can take the risks and send them to Medford High.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7220.621s">[Knight]</a>: And that's what parents are going to say to themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7222.142s">[Knight]</a>: They're going to say, is it worth it to me to spend this money to not have to put up with stuff like this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7227.306s">[Knight]</a>: And parents are going to say yes, because I'm a parent that's thinking about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7233.13s">[Knight]</a>: I'm losing faith in the Medford public school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7237.914s">[Knight]</a>: And I hate to say it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7239.915s">[Knight]</a>: I hate to say it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7241.533s">[Knight]</a>: Because I went to the Hervey School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7244.355s">[Knight]</a>: I went to the Brooks School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7246.676s">[Knight]</a>: I went to the Hopps School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7248.357s">[Knight]</a>: I went to Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7250.178s">[Knight]</a>: I played sports for Bud Kelly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7252.139s">[Knight]</a>: I learned about what it's like to have blue and white in my veins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7255.061s">[Knight]</a>: I learned about what it's like to be responsible, to want to be someone that gives back to his community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7260.805s">[Knight]</a>: And that's why I chose to seek public office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7263.686s">[Knight]</a>: And when I sit here and I watch some of my colleagues in government hide under their desk, it infuriates me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7271.96s">[Knight]</a>: It's okay to say no sometimes, you know, and it's okay to say yes, but what you have to do is say something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7278.564s">[Knight]</a>: You can't stand for anything if you don't know where you stand and what you stand for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7285.488s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8802.441s">[Knight]</a>: Madam President, if I may.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8804.743s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8805.403s">[Knight]</a>: You know, there's no such thing as a utopian society.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8815.489s">[Knight]</a>: And I don't think in this instance that throwing money at an issue and quite frankly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8823.123s">[Knight]</a>: given the decision makers who aren't allocating funds properly in the first place, more money to spend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8831.25s">[Knight]</a>: I don't think this is going to do anything for those children that need to go to school tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8836.534s">[Knight]</a>: It might help in the long run, but it's not going to do anything for those children that need to go to school tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8845.441s">[Knight]</a>: What this is about is reallocation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8851.025s">[Knight]</a>: As of right now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8852.895s">[Knight]</a>: The committee needs to live within its means because there is no funding request from the mayor before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8858.897s">[Knight]</a>: So we can jump up and down and say, we want more money, we want more money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8861.398s">[Knight]</a>: We do that every week about every issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8863.799s">[Knight]</a>: But ultimately right now, the administration hasn't put the paper before this body, which tells me the administration isn't taking it seriously, which would again, move me to the position to say, you have to live within your means and reallocate your funds then to address this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8878.605s">[Knight]</a>: So what's the plan and what are you going to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8881.141s">[Knight]</a>: And why are our kids going back to school tomorrow if you don't have a plan and you don't know what you're gonna do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8887.405s">[Knight]</a>: Quite frankly, I think the school should have been shut down until after Christmas vacation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8891.768s">[Knight]</a>: Blanket, sorry, high school's closed until after Christmas vacation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8895.691s">[Knight]</a>: In the interest of safety, in the interest of us showing this community that we're serious about the issues that are before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8901.674s">[Knight]</a>: Because a year has gone by and we haven't showed that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8907.938s">[Knight]</a>: So, you know, I'm certainly someone that recognizes that there's a need for resources, but I also think that there is room for reallocation of existing funds, existing policies, and existing practices that will improve the safety in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8930.285s">[Knight]</a>: Reversing some of the policy decisions that were made over the last year is a good start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8938.473s">[Knight]</a>: But again, there's no such thing as a utopian society and there's never going to be enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8943.634s">[Knight]</a>: How much is enough?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8945.234s">[Knight]</a>: There's never going to be enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8946.815s">[Knight]</a>: There's never, we're never going to reach a point where you say, Oh, we're cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8949.175s">[Knight]</a>: This is good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8949.875s">[Knight]</a>: This is enough money for us to do whatever we need to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8952.396s">[Knight]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8952.736s">[Knight]</a>: That doesn't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8954.556s">[Knight]</a>: That doesn't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8955.376s">[Knight]</a>: Nobody says, I want to make less money next year than I made this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8958.657s">[Knight]</a>: That's just not the way it works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8960.537s">[Knight]</a>: So, you know, we can keep throwing money at issues or we can say, where are you allocating this money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8964.758s">[Knight]</a>: And is this a good plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8966.257s">[Knight]</a>: Because throwing money at issues doesn't do anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8967.978s">[Knight]</a>: It's not going to fix the problem if we're not spending it in the right place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8970.659s">[Knight]</a>: And it's clear that the money we've already provided isn't being spent in the right place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8974.581s">[Knight]</a>: So maybe it comes down to a reallocation plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8976.763s">[Knight]</a>: And then what can we do to supplement that reallocation plan, but let them live with the existing means that they have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8981.445s">[Knight]</a>: Because quite frankly, it seems like every time something comes up to just anything in this community, quite frankly, anytime anything comes up, it's we don't have any money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8988.889s">[Knight]</a>: We don't have any money to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8989.869s">[Knight]</a>: We don't have any money to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8992.011s">[Knight]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8992.311s">[Knight]</a>: Well, if you don't have any money to do it, it needs to get done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8994.212s">[Knight]</a>: Then what's the next thing you got to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8995.632s">[Knight]</a>: You got to reallocate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8996.832s">[Knight]</a>: You're going to change your game plan up a little bit there, folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8999.473s">[Knight]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9000.874s">[Knight]</a>: Bella check at halftime, you know, change the game plan, win the game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9004.294s">[Knight]</a>: We're not changing the game plan at halftime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9006.635s">[Knight]</a>: We're not taking a real strong self-assessment as to where we stand and then making adjustments to improve our position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9610.437s">[Knight]</a>: My understanding that the student was relatively new student in the school transfer student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9614.159s">[Knight]</a>: That's my understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9620.736s">[Knight]</a>: And do you feel as though this might be related to a bullying incident or something like that, an underlying bullying incident?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9626.18s">[Knight]</a>: What was the basis of the argument, the series of events or event that gave cause to arise to such an action?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9707.788s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9708.989s">[Knight]</a>: Could the student that stabbed the other student actually be let back into school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9713.513s">[Knight]</a>: Not according to the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9715.836s">[Knight]</a>: Is it the intention of the school administration to expel that student?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9724.023s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9724.324s">[Knight]</a>: I'm asking if the kid's getting expelled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10102.35s">[Knight]</a>: Was there a drug overdose?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10106.914s">[Knight]</a>: Is that what the drug overdose?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10120.683s">[Knight]</a>: And you did say that the police and the fire department were there today?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10125.746s">[Knight]</a>: What kind of support?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10145.211s">[Knight]</a>: So they weren't there in a security capacity?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10169.636s">[Knight]</a>: And I mean, I understand that, you know, violence happens in schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10175.883s">[Knight]</a>: Most high schools on the news every day, though, ours is. Ours is on the news every day, surrounding communities on the news every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10183.908s">[Knight]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10184.388s">[Knight]</a>: And don't make this about the Medford City Council gets passionate about issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10187.329s">[Knight]</a>: So it's our fault that kids get stabbed in high school, because that's nonsense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10189.949s">[Knight]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10190.229s">[Knight]</a>: Because we don't make the policies up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10191.87s">[Knight]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10192.33s">[Knight]</a>: The school committee does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10193.19s">[Knight]</a>: They're the ones that set the policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10194.79s">[Knight]</a>: They're the ones that are responsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10203.552s">[Knight]</a>: Why are the 12 kids hanging out in the bathroom?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10216.061s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not trying to hold you accountable for the words you just said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10218.763s">[Knight]</a>: And I have the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10219.904s">[Knight]</a>: You don't have a point of information because you're not a Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10224.727s">[Knight]</a>: I'm finished, Madam President, because this is like ridiculous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10228.049s">[Knight]</a>: This is ridiculous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10228.73s">[Knight]</a>: So what's the plan going forward tomorrow when these kids go back to school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10232.472s">[Knight]</a>: How are they going to be safer than they were yesterday?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10236.655s">[Knight]</a>: Let's answer that question, because that's really what the people care about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10289.303s">[Knight]</a>: And to all those people listening, when you go to the school committee, remember that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10337.645s">[Knight]</a>: But I just have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10338.566s">[Knight]</a>: How many of those administrators and other individuals that were deployed in the hallways that trained in safety training, trained in how to keep somebody safe?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10350.756s">[Knight]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10351.356s">[Knight]</a>: You keep piping in too, because I'm trying to figure that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10353.158s">[Knight]</a>: Everybody's interrupting each other, so maybe you should stop that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10418.614s">[Knight]</a>: I'm a little bit less concerned about the counseling of the traumatized bodies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10421.676s">[Knight]</a>: And I'm a little bit more concerned about how we're going to keep bodies safe from getting stabbed and beat up and fought and stuff like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10427.178s">[Knight]</a>: So obviously we've got a systemic problem there, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10430.82s">[Knight]</a>: These events are happening over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10434.982s">[Knight]</a>: We've had two major events in the last 60 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10439.324s">[Knight]</a>: It's not isolated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15118.737s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15160.312s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15377.48s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15487.185s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15562.758s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15645.743s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15765.833s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15798.919s">[Knight]</a>: Nothing more than what she's spending her apple money on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15801.68s">[Knight]</a>: We don't have any say whatsoever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15804.722s">[Knight]</a>: So I don't understand why we need to entertain these presentations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15808.304s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, all it is is a dog and pony show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15809.925s">[Knight]</a>: I really think it's nothing more than campaigning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15812.206s">[Knight]</a>: It's really campaigning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15813.067s">[Knight]</a>: It has nothing to do with what's going on in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15814.887s">[Knight]</a>: There's nothing to do with what's going on with his body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15816.488s">[Knight]</a>: It's campaigning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15817.929s">[Knight]</a>: So I don't think that that should be allowed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15819.25s">[Knight]</a>: I think that if the mayor is going to offer a paper that the paper should be related to issues that require council action by law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15846.215s">[Knight]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15846.515s">[Knight]</a>: So, so Madam President, what that really is, is that's a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15849.056s">[Knight]</a>: We don't want to do anything without doing anything because we want you guys to make sure that if we do it, you're not going to say anything bad if we make a mistake, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15855.739s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, ultimately they want verification and validation of the decisions that they make it, but we don't have to take a vote on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15861.102s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, come on, be a leader, make decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=207.309s">[Knight]</a>: Madam President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=208.65s">[Knight]</a>: And I join Councilor Scarpelli in offering my condolences to the family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=212.935s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. Garrity was a great person, Lawrence State's resident, known by friends and family alike as Bayer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=220.238s">[Knight]</a>: And I think Councilor Scott Nelly hit the nail on the head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=223.439s">[Knight]</a>: Although he's left us here, he's going to leave a legacy behind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=227.701s">[Knight]</a>: If it weren't for the Garrity family, I don't think the city would have been in a good position to create the Office of Outreach and Prevention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=235.384s">[Knight]</a>: But they came up with this council and they advocated for this story out there, and they helped fight the addiction stigma.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=241.821s">[Knight]</a>: and it was because of their work that Wisconsin has been able to move forward this season, fighting the epidemic and I just want to echo Councilor Scarpelli's indulgences and also my gratitude for their services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=273.942s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=274.943s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=348.434s">[Knight]</a>: Madam President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=349.816s">[Knight]</a>: It's amazing to think that what started out as a small convenience store in Malden three generations of family ago has now transformed into one of the largest camera stores around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=360.146s">[Knight]</a>: I had the great pleasure and opportunity to go to school with both Scott and Gary, and I call them both friends actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=365.872s">[Knight]</a>: I see Gary quite a bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=367.274s">[Knight]</a>: He's moved back to Metro recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=369.207s">[Knight]</a>: And it's just great to see that they've been able to continue the family tradition and continue so much success with the business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=374.711s">[Knight]</a>: So I want to wish them the best of luck in their future endeavors and congratulate them on such a momentous occasion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=455.087s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=457.128s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=480.108s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=484.449s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1415.717s">[Knight]</a>: I'll defer comment at this time, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1591.415s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1597.118s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1638.885s">[Knight]</a>: Point of clarification, Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1641.723s">[Knight]</a>: It sounds more like a reorganization of the whole entire agenda than taking an item out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1647.585s">[Knight]</a>: Can the council just explain the purpose for making the request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1661.348s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you for the explanation, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1663.309s">[Knight]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1684.68s">[Knight]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1776.311s">[Knight]</a>: Madam President, motion to waive the remainder of the reading and move for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1780.773s">[Knight]</a>: This is a contractually adjusted wage increase that's been negotiated by the administration and the union.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1805.908s">[Knight]</a>: I have never been one to stand in the way of waiving the readings to ensure that hardworking men and women in the city of Medford receive the cost of living adjustments as they duly deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2139.841s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2142.283s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2620.144s">[Knight]</a>: Madam President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2621.965s">[Knight]</a>: I think it's also very important to point out that this is 100% an enforcement issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2626.799s">[Knight]</a>: And we do have the controls in place and it's a matter of the administration taking steps that are necessary to ensure that neighborhoods are protected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2634.681s">[Knight]</a>: So that's number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2636.101s">[Knight]</a>: And number two, we also have to think about what's prompting residents in this community to move towards not being landlords and instead being Airbnb operators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2646.184s">[Knight]</a>: And some of it has to do with the discussion, I think, about policies that might go into effect in this community in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2652.465s">[Knight]</a>: Some of it has to do with the fact that there's a lot of strong tenant rights laws<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2656.425s">[Knight]</a>: And landlords feel like sometimes they're at a disadvantage when they go in to pursue non payment or rent issues and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2663.354s">[Knight]</a>: So policy that we create also impacts these trends in housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2669.907s">[Knight]</a>: So it's important for us to look at the big picture as we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2672.709s">[Knight]</a>: But I can certainly agree with all my council colleagues and saying that this is 100% enforcement issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2676.931s">[Knight]</a>: And it's something that needs to be handled the forthright.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2680.713s">[Knight]</a>: Ultimately, you know, it's about protecting the neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2682.934s">[Knight]</a>: And right now we're not doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2684.094s">[Knight]</a>: And that's something we need to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2685.095s">[Knight]</a>: So I thank the council for bringing the issue forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2721.533s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2722.913s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3711.02s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3713.942s">[Knight]</a>: Madam President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3715.803s">[Knight]</a>: I look at this in a couple of different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3718.905s">[Knight]</a>: The first of which is, you know, all of this,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3722.29s">[Knight]</a>: getting involved between someone trying to sell a house and someone trying to buy a house and the regulations and restrictions that surround it is part of the due diligence process when you're purchasing a home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3734.222s">[Knight]</a>: or when you're purchasing a piece of property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3736.643s">[Knight]</a>: And I know that that's a process that's heavily regulated as it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3742.505s">[Knight]</a>: I think we better be very careful in how far we're going to be going in performing the due diligence for these private landowners conducting private land transactions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3753.23s">[Knight]</a>: So, with that being said, you know, I can certainly see the issue going on with the lack of enforcement of BMPs in the community, the strict code that we've established that would provide you only 90 days a year for rental.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3765.678s">[Knight]</a>: But at the end of the day, you know, I think that there has to be a spot where government doesn't get so involved in people's lives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3771.322s">[Knight]</a>: So, we have to draw our line somewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3772.823s">[Knight]</a>: And I think that when that line is doing the due diligence for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3778.638s">[Knight]</a>: potential homebuyers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3780.679s">[Knight]</a>: It just doesn't really fall within the scope of what a government service is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3784.5s">[Knight]</a>: And I think that at the end of the day, we'd be providing far too much energy and effort and performing an exercise that's not going to reap great results.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3792.903s">[Knight]</a>: I think we'd be much better off putting our energy, efforts, and time into enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3798.624s">[Knight]</a>: So that's where I stand on this matter, but thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4123.834s">[Knight]</a>: That's an old high five, Madam President, my apologies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4652.611s">[Knight]</a>: On that point, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4656.454s">[Knight]</a>: I think it's important to point out that we probably do have one of the strongest short-term rental ordinances in the region.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4663.92s">[Knight]</a>: But again, it's an issue about enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4666.763s">[Knight]</a>: To Mr. Castagnetti's question, this has been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4671.821s">[Knight]</a>: reviewed at the state level extensively, and it's been determined that local municipalities can't ban them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4678.164s">[Knight]</a>: But what we can do is regulate them, but we can regulate them only to a certain extent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4682.466s">[Knight]</a>: And we've utilized our legislative power to do that to the fullest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4686.728s">[Knight]</a>: The question now is, can the administration put the teeth that we gave them to good use, and be sure that our ordinance is enforced to the level that the taxpayers deserve?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5309.265s">[Knight]</a>: Madam President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5310.606s">[Knight]</a>: I think moving forward as we go through our zoning reform, this is something we also might want to take a look at where the ADA requires a minimum of 20%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5317.89s">[Knight]</a>: I don't think there's anything that could prevent us from requiring more than that, number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5323.054s">[Knight]</a>: Number two, as we've established policies in this community as a council through zoning reform that's reduced<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5329.077s">[Knight]</a>: the parking minimums in certain developments with that obviously would come a reduction in the number of parking for handicapped blackout holders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5336.62s">[Knight]</a>: So again, you know, an unintended consequence of policy change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5340.321s">[Knight]</a>: So it's something that needs to be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5341.602s">[Knight]</a>: And I think a good way to approach that might be through our next round of zoning codification and maybe increasing the minimum number of parking spots that would be required or reserved for our disabled residents here in the community and elsewhere that are visiting our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6210.398s">[Knight]</a>: Madam President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6216.471s">[Knight]</a>: I am at a loss sitting here hearing that after the amount of money that we spent on outside council, that represents the mayor personally and not the city of Medford, an amount of money is some of the totals close to a half a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6243.175s">[Knight]</a>: over $450,000 we spent on KP Law's legal fees in what appears to be violation of city ordinance, Madam Mayor, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6254.545s">[Knight]</a>: Once again, I'm calling you Madam Mayor, because I'm just wishing it would be somebody else, but the one that's in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6260.03s">[Knight]</a>: When I think about this, Madam President, it makes me crazy, because for three years, I feel like I was talking in an echo chamber.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6269.767s">[Knight]</a>: saying we need to hire a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6271.429s">[Knight]</a>: We need a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6272.49s">[Knight]</a>: We need to hire a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6273.791s">[Knight]</a>: We still don't have a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6275.353s">[Knight]</a>: Instead, we have a private law firm that we paid a half a million dollars to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6280.097s">[Knight]</a>: It's too busy to go to court and represent the interests of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6285.363s">[Knight]</a>: That shows you where their priorities lay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6289.807s">[Knight]</a>: It also shows you how inept this administration is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6294.645s">[Knight]</a>: when it comes to the deliverance of basic city services, number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6298.108s">[Knight]</a>: And number two, the protection of the taxpayers' interests when it comes to having in-house legal counsel that represents the taxpayer and not the corner office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6307.697s">[Knight]</a>: So here we are again, two months after the budget passed, asking for more money for a code enforcement office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6313.643s">[Knight]</a>: So when we had an opportunity, when we had an opportunity to hold up a budget and get what we needed, number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6319.788s">[Knight]</a>: Number two,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6320.891s">[Knight]</a>: And we're coming off the heels of a budget where the mayor said she was gonna hire a solicitor and an assistant city solicitor for the council and never did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6327.655s">[Knight]</a>: Unfulfilled promises, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6333.739s">[Knight]</a>: Unfulfilled promises.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6337.301s">[Knight]</a>: This has been the number one issue, the number one underlying theme throughout this past term for this council is where is our legal representation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6347.727s">[Knight]</a>: We're driving a ship without a compass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6350.615s">[Knight]</a>: We're going into uncharted territory, and we need guidance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6353.938s">[Knight]</a>: Please help us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6356.079s">[Knight]</a>: Please help us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6358.141s">[Knight]</a>: That's the council asking, and the council gets ignored.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6363.685s">[Knight]</a>: Now, Madam President, we have residents asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6367.047s">[Knight]</a>: They're saying, please help us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6368.549s">[Knight]</a>: Please help us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6369.409s">[Knight]</a>: And they're now being ignored.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6370.95s">[Knight]</a>: And KP law is defaulting on court appearances that they filed, that they filed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6380.046s">[Knight]</a>: KP law is directing the board of health not to put clean it and lean it notices on homes after the council is directing them to do so because such levels of dissatisfaction in the public administration of the enforcement of code.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6400.422s">[Knight]</a>: So again, we can put the record on repeat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6402.904s">[Knight]</a>: Madam president, here we are again, the same spot we were 12 months ago, the same ones we were the same spot we were 12 months before that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6410.552s">[Knight]</a>: I sit here and I scratch my head every day and I say, let's name one thing the city does well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6420.26s">[Knight]</a>: Let's name one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6423.462s">[Knight]</a>: Our school test scores are down about eight, 9% across the board in the last three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6430.067s">[Knight]</a>: Our city streets look awful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6432.209s">[Knight]</a>: Our sidewalks look terrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6434.411s">[Knight]</a>: We can't get trees trimmed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6436.012s">[Knight]</a>: We can't get stumps removed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6437.822s">[Knight]</a>: We can't get crosswalks repainted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6439.744s">[Knight]</a>: We can't get 3-3 paved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6443.326s">[Knight]</a>: The only saving grace we have in this community is we pick up that phone and dial 9-1-1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6446.969s">[Knight]</a>: And we know that the police and the fire are always going to show up with or without a contract for 700 plus days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6457.677s">[Knight]</a>: So when I sit here and I reflect on what's going on in this community and I ask myself, what are we doing well?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6463.922s">[Knight]</a>: What are we doing well?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6465.343s">[Knight]</a>: That's one of the hottest questions I have to struggle with every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6468.598s">[Knight]</a>: Because when I look around, I don't see anything that we're doing well, that we're exceeding at, that we're excelling at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6472.641s">[Knight]</a>: I don't see anything that's putting Medford on the forefront, that's keeping Medford where it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6482.469s">[Knight]</a>: 10 years ago when I got elected, Medford was the hottest zip code in Massachusetts because of its large inventory of single family homes and its small class sizes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6492.516s">[Knight]</a>: Boy, how times have changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6494.218s">[Knight]</a>: Boy, how times have changed, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6498.766s">[Knight]</a>: We're a community that's losing its identity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6503.069s">[Knight]</a>: And pretty soon we're going to be swallowed up and become just a pocket of Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6508.733s">[Knight]</a>: The zoning reform that's coming up is going to be very important to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6512.355s">[Knight]</a>: And I hope the mayor keeps her word this time around and provides us with the tools necessary to succeed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6518.34s">[Knight]</a>: Because right now, I feel as though the city is not in a strong position for now or for the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6523.063s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6741.683s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6747.566s">[Knight]</a>: I have a question regarding enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6937.516s">[Knight]</a>: Madam President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6939.217s">[Knight]</a>: Actually Tufts through their development has agreed with the city to pay taxes, property taxes, I believe in all the new purchases of land and I've done so for over a decade now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6950.881s">[Knight]</a>: But I think Madam President that the most moving thing that was said tonight was take care of the good people because if you don't, you're going to lose them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6958.704s">[Knight]</a>: And you're just going to get more of the bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6963.254s">[Knight]</a>: I really think that was the most moving thing that was said this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6966.057s">[Knight]</a>: Take care of the good people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6967.079s">[Knight]</a>: Give the good people some help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6968.749s">[Knight]</a>: because that's all they're asking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6970.99s">[Knight]</a>: So I appreciate the gentleman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6972.291s">[Knight]</a>: That's something that really resonated with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6974.572s">[Knight]</a>: I think that, you know, we all know what we need to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6977.113s">[Knight]</a>: We need to get action on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6978.534s">[Knight]</a>: We need to hold the administration accountable for their failures and delivering the basic public services that these people deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6984.457s">[Knight]</a>: And I can't understand why we don't have a program or a maintenance plan or a review plan where we go out to these distressed properties, which we know we've had problems with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6994.088s">[Knight]</a>: year after year and do a spot check once every 6, 8 or 12 months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6999.154s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, it's basic, basic, basic stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7001.697s">[Knight]</a>: The person that's answering the phone knows the phone's gonna, knows they're gonna get the phone call and when they see who it is that's calling them,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7007.594s">[Knight]</a>: know exactly what it's about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7008.615s">[Knight]</a>: It's gotten to that point with people in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7011.817s">[Knight]</a>: So I don't understand why we can't take a couple of steps and be a little bit more proactive and have an outreach program where, you know, when we know we have these distressed properties and these properties that are failing to do right by the neighborhood, that we don't go out there and do a little bit of outreach and preventative maintenance, as they like to say, to prevent this from happening and rising to this level of frustration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7531.9s">[Knight]</a>: I want to commend my council colleague for suggesting that we move to supplement our code enforcement staff with the use of, whether it be retired police officers, was it, Councilor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7546.945s">[Knight]</a>: Or code enforcement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7565.482s">[Knight]</a>: Yeah, I mean, I think that's a great idea, especially when you look at how human resources in this community is handled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7572.547s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, how many times have we had per diem department heads?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7575.95s">[Knight]</a>: We've had a per diem assessor, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7578.292s">[Knight]</a>: We've had a per diem building commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7580.313s">[Knight]</a>: We had a per diem veteran services director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7583.676s">[Knight]</a>: Why can't we do that with code?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7586.638s">[Knight]</a>: That sounds like a great idea to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8033.182s">[Knight]</a>: That was an oldie but goodie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8164.491s">[Knight]</a>: Madam President, I will be happy to waive the reading and give a brief synopsis as my intention is to request that this go to some subcommittee or committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8180.09s">[Knight]</a>: Jesus Christmas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8210.553s">[Knight]</a>: Madam President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8211.754s">[Knight]</a>: I bring this resolution forward requesting that we have a little bit more accountability and some tracking and measurement of data when it comes to the use of take-home vehicles here in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8220.258s">[Knight]</a>: Now, there are certain positions in the community that one would expect as a take-home vehicle, the chief of police, the chief of fire, the DPW commissioner, but there are other positions in this community where people are allowed to take-home vehicles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8232.123s">[Knight]</a>: So the question therein remains, how much use and wear and tear is being put on these vehicles that's being utilized for purposes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8241.357s">[Knight]</a>: work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8242.517s">[Knight]</a>: Ultimately, this council has appropriated hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions of dollars for the replacement of equipment and part of our fleet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8250.6s">[Knight]</a>: And as we go through the process of replacing vehicles that are becoming, I guess we'd say, less equipped to deal with the wear and tear of our everyday<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8261.76s">[Knight]</a>: work that we perform here in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8264.883s">[Knight]</a>: It's interesting to see where these new vehicles are going and what their uses are for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8269.046s">[Knight]</a>: Ultimately, you know, I think that there are some protections that we need to put in place to prevent the city from getting into circumstances where we might be liable for things that we didn't anticipate we were going to become liable for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8280.193s">[Knight]</a>: Now, whether or not these trucks are provided by contract or by grant, the department head or the mayor, they do have implications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8288.036s">[Knight]</a>: For example, Madam President, if someone were provided a take-home vehicle and they were injured in the line of work, the cost of that take-home vehicle goes towards their wage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8297.139s">[Knight]</a>: So when they're out of work collecting compensation, they'd be compensated based upon the wage that they earn plus the value of the vehicle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8305.073s">[Knight]</a>: So that greatly increases the city's liability when it comes down to certain issues of employees that are into the line of work, number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8311.299s">[Knight]</a>: Number two, take-home vehicles also increase the city's liability if there were an accident to occur outside of working hours, outside of city limits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8321.387s">[Knight]</a>: There's also a question about how much of the city's resources in the form of gasoline<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8328.392s">[Knight]</a>: and other maintenance and upkeep necessities are being placed on these vehicles through the commute to and from work and they're not used inside the city limits or for city purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8339.276s">[Knight]</a>: So the intention of the ordinance, Madam President, is to put some restrictions upon this and put some data reporting requirements on this so the city knows where their fleet is, what their fleet is doing, when they're doing it outside of city limits and outside of city operating hours and how much<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8353.92s">[Knight]</a>: wear and tear is being put on these vehicles that's being done not in the performance of the city duties but in the performance of traveling to and from work commuting and other items for life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8362.988s">[Knight]</a>: I mean ultimately a take-home vehicle would be only utilized for the purpose of going to your house and from your house and when you get home you're going to get into your own private vehicle so tracking this mileage is very important I think for us in this community to be sure that our fleets are being maintained in the proper and most satisfaction in the court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8378.742s">[Knight]</a>: also take on vehicles to present tax implications, if I'm not mistaken, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8384.287s">[Knight]</a>: So these are things that we need to take a look at and be sure that we're complying with all standards of our federal state statute as well going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8391.113s">[Knight]</a>: So that's why I raised the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8392.114s">[Knight]</a>: It's something that seemed important to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8393.896s">[Knight]</a>: It doesn't seem too important to many of you, but I certainly think that asking that a city<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8401.411s">[Knight]</a>: vehicle isn't something that's too much to ask, and that we track where these vehicles are going when they're outside of city limits, outside of working hours isn't too much to ask, and that we track the mileage on these vehicles when they're outside of city limits, outside of working hours isn't too much to ask, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8415.297s">[Knight]</a>: So that's the basis of the ordinance, and I ask for my council colleagues to support sending this to subcommittees so that we can have a further discussion with our future legal counsel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8443.284s">[Knight]</a>: It's up to you guys, really.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8445.305s">[Knight]</a>: It's an ordinance, so it probably should be fitting to go to that subcommittee, but if it wants to go to public safety, or if it wants to go to, I do believe there was a request prior to put together a subcommittee on legal services and litigation that we're still waiting to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8458.288s">[Knight]</a>: It could go there once that gets created, but whatever it is that you see fit, council, if it has any divine wisdom, I'd be happy to support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9151.481s">[Knight]</a>: Madam President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9153.183s">[Knight]</a>: I think Councilor Scarpelli is correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9155.885s">[Knight]</a>: Things at Tufts University aren't very different than things at City Hall when it comes to labor relations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9164.551s">[Knight]</a>: The only difference is our friends at Tufts University have the power to strike.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9170.936s">[Knight]</a>: And that's what they did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9171.716s">[Knight]</a>: And I commend them for taking the steps that they see necessary to ensure that they secure a fair collective bargaining agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9178.425s">[Knight]</a>: I support their right to organize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9180.286s">[Knight]</a>: I support any group's right to organize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9186.288s">[Knight]</a>: I do feel as though Tufts University this evening has been given a very bad rap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9194.51s">[Knight]</a>: And I, in no uncertain terms, agree with the way that Tufts University is handling this issue with their RAs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9206.716s">[Knight]</a>: Nor do I agree with their position on the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9209.718s">[Knight]</a>: However, they've been taking a pretty good beating this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9214.18s">[Knight]</a>: And I think it's important that we point out there are many benefits that do come with being host to a university.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9223.906s">[Knight]</a>: One is prestigious as such university.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9228.308s">[Knight]</a>: We keep talking about the fact that they don't pay taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9231.85s">[Knight]</a>: That's patently false.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9234.472s">[Knight]</a>: They don't pay taxes on a portion of their property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9237.631s">[Knight]</a>: And they've entered into an agreement voluntarily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9242.254s">[Knight]</a>: But they've said that they will continue to pay property taxes on newly purchased properties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9247.257s">[Knight]</a>: And this has been going on for quite some time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9251.18s">[Knight]</a>: So Tufts University is not the villain that we make them out to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9254.782s">[Knight]</a>: Do problems come along with having Tufts University in our community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9259.265s">[Knight]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9260.826s">[Knight]</a>: Every problem in every community stems from something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9265.148s">[Knight]</a>: Tufts is not a villain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9266.647s">[Knight]</a>: when we look at the benefits that they bring to our community, like diversity, like economic stability during unstable and poor economic times, or like the community of academics that tend to call Medford their home after being employed at one of the most prestigious universities in the United States of America.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9292.987s">[Knight]</a>: So, Madam President, I can understand that being a good neighbor is one thing, but I think that they've always been a good partner, they've always lent a listening ear, and they've always invested in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9305.019s">[Knight]</a>: Whether or not you feel as though they're giving enough is one thing, but they always have been some of us willing to come to the table and sit down with us, and I think that that's important to point out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9314.969s">[Knight]</a>: I just wish that Clemson University took that same approach with their RAs and was willing to sit down with them at the table and put this issue behind them and reach a fair collective bargaining agreement for all involved so that we can move on because ultimately the ones that get affected the most are the students and the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9330.157s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, Madam President, these parents are making a $70,000 investment<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9335.488s">[Knight]</a>: for the kids to worry about whether or not their IRAs are gonna have a contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9340.07s">[Knight]</a>: So we need Tufts to get back to the table and negotiate this, because these Tufts students are residents of Metro, and the IRAs are residents of Metro, and they deserve our support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9349.433s">[Knight]</a>: I support the people of Iowa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9350.853s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9452.689s">[Knight]</a>: It's in the direct rebuttal to the statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9458.39s">[Knight]</a>: I just know I just don't want I don't want you to think that I'm saying the firefighters should go on strike or that I support that or that number or number two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9465.862s">[Knight]</a>: that the firefighters would even consider that because I think we've heard time and time again the firefighters come up here and say all we want to do is keep Medford safe and we're going to continue to come to work no matter what and we're going to fight to do that and we're going to fight for fair wages in the meantime and if it takes 800 to 900 days we're not going to lie down but we're going to still continue to come to work today and I don't so I don't I don't think the firefighters would support the statement of saying we're going to go on strike.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9488.809s">[Knight]</a>: And I don't want anybody to think that that's what I was intending to say, or intended to say that they should do, because I don't speak for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9495.715s">[Knight]</a>: So I just don't want to be misconstrued or misinterpreted in saying that I think the firefighters should go on strike, or that I think the firefighters would go on strike if they have the power, because I can't speak for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9504.403s">[Knight]</a>: But from what I've heard and from my conversations with them, these men and women will come to work every day to make sure this community is safe, and they have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9512.129s">[Knight]</a>: and they will continue to do so, and I don't see them ever, ever, ever taking a position where they take a strike action against the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9518.151s">[Knight]</a>: They'll continue to fight for fair wages in the proper format, but I don't ever see them doing something illegal in order to jeopardize the safety of the residents in this community, nor would I condone it, nor do I think they would.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9529.834s">[Knight]</a>: So thank you, Madam President, for allowing me the opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9532.235s">[Knight]</a>: I just wanted to be very clear in my words, and I didn't want to get them misconstrued, because sometimes that happens over social media.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9539.84s">[Knight]</a>: virtual Zoom stuff, not social media.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9542.543s">[Knight]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9732.47s">[Knight]</a>: Don't activate me, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9825.322s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=10031.004s">[Knight]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=221.961s">[Knight]</a>: Madam President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=223.502s">[Knight]</a>: I'd like to echo the sentiments of my fellow Councilors, Paul Howard was a great man, I someone that I had the pleasure of getting to know at a very young age picture Mr. Howard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=234.842s">[Knight]</a>: 50 plus years old, playing full court basketball at Carr Park with, you know, 20, 25 kids between the ages of 15 and 25 years old and absolutely dominating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=246.288s">[Knight]</a>: Paul was an amazing athlete.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=249.25s">[Knight]</a>: His accolades on the basketball court for Somerville High School back in the 50s and early 60s is something that I talked about very, very fondly to this day among my father and his friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=259.195s">[Knight]</a>: And whenever Paul Howard's name come up,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=261.836s">[Knight]</a>: They always speak of his work ethic and the type of gentleman that he was, just a kind man that went to work, put his head down and did the right thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=269.603s">[Knight]</a>: He's someone that's going to be sadly missed in this community, and I'm very lucky that I had the opportunity to call him a friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=469.296s">[Knight]</a>: Madam President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=471.418s">[Knight]</a>: Again, Bob Maloney Sr.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=473.459s">[Knight]</a>: was a gentleman that I had the opportunity of developing a great friendship with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=477.342s">[Knight]</a>: I remember fondly the summer of 2005 after the passing of Senator Shannon and I was working on the Callahan campaign for State Senate and Bob Maloney Sr.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=486.468s">[Knight]</a>: was in the office every single day making phone calls and we'd go out knocking on doors and he had such a way about him, you know, he was great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=493.753s">[Knight]</a>: He'd walk up to the door, he'd knock<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=495.314s">[Knight]</a>: knock on the door and he'd say, Hey, I'm Bob Maloney.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=497.476s">[Knight]</a>: I'm the city councilor from down here in this neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=500.078s">[Knight]</a>: And this is the guy we're supporting for city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=502.28s">[Knight]</a>: So we're going to, for our state Senate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=504.262s">[Knight]</a>: So we're going to put a sign on your front lawn and we're going to get you to vote for him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=506.964s">[Knight]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=507.685s">[Knight]</a>: Okay, Bob, no problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=509.006s">[Knight]</a>: And they'd walk away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=509.667s">[Knight]</a>: The guy was amazing on the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=510.888s">[Knight]</a>: He was one of the best campaigners I've ever seen in my life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=514.311s">[Knight]</a>: And he raised<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=515.812s">[Knight]</a>: a great family of public servants that are following in his footsteps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=519.453s">[Knight]</a>: To Gordon, to Sean and to Bobby, my deepest condolences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=523.595s">[Knight]</a>: You're all great friends and it's very sad to lose a man of your father's stature, but he's in a better place now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=531.217s">[Knight]</a>: And I thank the Lord and I thank you guys for your friendship and for the opportunity to have stood beside your father during a period of time where we were able to have a lot of fun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3956.134s">[Knight]</a>: Motion to sever the amendments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3966.458s">[Knight]</a>: Separate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3967.899s">[Knight]</a>: Just one by one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3968.479s">[Knight]</a>: Okay, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4159.0s">[Knight]</a>: Madam President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4160.441s">[Knight]</a>: First of all, I'd like to withdraw my motion to seven amendments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4164.355s">[Knight]</a>: And second Council business motion to approve the first reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4169.824s">[Knight]</a>: After taking a how to look at the amendments that he's made I don't see any reason to seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4174.555s">[Knight]</a>: This is something that I think we need to also thank our friend john Falco for because Council Falco was the person that kicked this off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4182.481s">[Knight]</a>: And this wouldn't have gotten as far as it had if it weren't for john's diligence and john's work on this particular issue when he served as a member of the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4191.607s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, Madam President, I support the paper and I thank the gentleman for his amendments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4312.606s">[Knight]</a>: Don't encourage me, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5158.979s">[Knight]</a>: I'd love to speak, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5163.9s">[Knight]</a>: The paper before us is a paper where I question whether or not it's in proper form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5169.802s">[Knight]</a>: If we look at the Medford City Council rules, Rule 30 will read that every order before a bond issue shall<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5179.068s">[Knight]</a>: before its passage be referred to the city solicitor, who shall forthwith examine the same as to its legality and notify the council in writing of its findings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5189.391s">[Knight]</a>: The city solicitor is a position established by ordinance, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5194.732s">[Knight]</a>: Section 2-651, city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5197.052s">[Knight]</a>: There shall be a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5199.373s">[Knight]</a>: We don't have one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5201.193s">[Knight]</a>: Section 2-654, duties to legal instruments of the city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5208.112s">[Knight]</a>: The city solicitor shall advise and cause to be drafted bonds and other legal instruments of whatever as required by the mayor or the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5216.179s">[Knight]</a>: Again, the city solicitor did not draft this paper because we do not have one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5222.425s">[Knight]</a>: KP law is time and time again, confirm that they are not the city's attorney.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5227.329s">[Knight]</a>: They are the mayor's private legal counsel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5230.512s">[Knight]</a>: Their client is the mayor, no more, no less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5234.841s">[Knight]</a>: I question as to whether or not this paper meets the legal standard of merit and would move to have it sent to the Office of the Attorney General for an independent review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6486.907s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6489.367s">[Knight]</a>: To that point, Councilor Benson, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6494.008s">[Knight]</a>: Can KP law serve as the assistant city solicitor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6496.709s">[Knight]</a>: Because based upon the ordinance that this council passed at some point in time, it says there shall be a city solicitor, and there shall also be an assistant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6504.831s">[Knight]</a>: And when there is no city solicitor, the assistant shall be appointed solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6509.235s">[Knight]</a>: That's what the ordinance says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6511.497s">[Knight]</a>: So can the mayor unilaterally hire a law firm to work and be compensated at a rate of pay and a scale of pay far outside the compensation schedule that's established by the ordinance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6524.767s">[Knight]</a>: I don't think she can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6525.748s">[Knight]</a>: I don't think she can appoint a law firm into a position that's defined by ordinance with a salary attached to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6530.925s">[Knight]</a>: And we have to, at some point, bring this to a head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6533.947s">[Knight]</a>: You know, six months ago, seven, eight months ago now, we sat here and we debated a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6538.629s">[Knight]</a>: And like you said, the mayor said, oh, no problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6540.59s">[Knight]</a>: We're going to have assistant city solicitor for you guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6542.331s">[Knight]</a>: We're going to post it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6542.991s">[Knight]</a>: It's going to be an in-house position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6544.972s">[Knight]</a>: We still don't have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6546.233s">[Knight]</a>: And we still don't have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6547.134s">[Knight]</a>: That was all smoke to get the budget passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6549.335s">[Knight]</a>: You know, the mayor never had any intention of filling that position because if she did, it would be filled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6554.057s">[Knight]</a>: Um, you know, so that's, that's why I raised the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6556.699s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, we, we have no guidance whatsoever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6560.345s">[Knight]</a>: You know, we're like the clown show, you know, we sit here and we talk and we have great ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6565.79s">[Knight]</a>: And, you know, we want to follow through and we'd be very productive if we had the tools that were necessary to get the job done, but we don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6573.458s">[Knight]</a>: And it's very frustrating to not have those tools, especially when we have such a talented group of people that could do such good work, you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6581.486s">[Knight]</a>: So, you know, it's time we bring this thing to a head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6585.959s">[Knight]</a>: does the city of Medford require a city solicitor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6588.4s">[Knight]</a>: The ordinance says it does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6589.86s">[Knight]</a>: I don't know why there isn't one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6591.001s">[Knight]</a>: And if we don't have one, then there's a problem because there hasn't been one for quite a long period of time, which means that we're operating outside the ordinance, outside the defined parameters of how our government's supposed to operate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6604.825s">[Knight]</a>: You know, that's like saying there's supposed to be a secretary of state, but we're just not going to have one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6613.928s">[Knight]</a>: So that's why I raised it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6615.83s">[Knight]</a>: And to the point of the paper before us, I support the paper and its theory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6621.134s">[Knight]</a>: We need this equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6622.275s">[Knight]</a>: We need these jobs to be able to be performed in-house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6626.018s">[Knight]</a>: We need to get this done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6627.439s">[Knight]</a>: But we also have $700,000 of a $1.5 million appropriation that we made last year that still remains unspent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6634.365s">[Knight]</a>: You know, so in that regard, I think that, you know, we're not going to be in that bad of shape to put this off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6639.969s">[Knight]</a>: You know, we want to wait a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6641.029s">[Knight]</a>: We're not going to get a response in a week or two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6642.67s">[Knight]</a>: We're not going to get a response by March 14th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6644.551s">[Knight]</a>: You know, you know, it's going to take at least 30 days to get a legal response from the attorney general's office, you know, but, you know, it has to come to a head at some point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6652.976s">[Knight]</a>: You know, when I support the paper that's before us, you know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6656.139s">[Knight]</a>: You look at the capital plan, you know, you see these things in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6658.942s">[Knight]</a>: So it's not something that we haven't planned for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6661.824s">[Knight]</a>: You look at the funding sources, that's a little different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6663.566s">[Knight]</a>: You know, when you look at the funding sources in the capital plan, most of it says that it's going to be general fund debt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6668.831s">[Knight]</a>: It's not going to be something that's borrowed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6670.632s">[Knight]</a>: So, you know, that's where in lies the rub.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6673.635s">[Knight]</a>: But ultimately,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6676.104s">[Knight]</a>: In theory, it's a good paper, but in terms of process and procedure, this is something that we need to address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6681.605s">[Knight]</a>: And I think that this is a way that we can do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7227.405s">[Knight]</a>: We did say that during the budget hearings that we didn't like the setup.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7230.408s">[Knight]</a>: And that's why we agreed to pass a budget when the mayor said that she was going to provide us with an assistant city solicitor that works in the building for the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7378.478s">[Knight]</a>: Yeah, it's not a big deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7384.739s">[Knight]</a>: Motion, keep them all together, we can vote them as one package.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7393.425s">[Knight]</a>: approval as amended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7395.106s">[Knight]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7462.709s">[Knight]</a>: Madam President, we're into suspension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7468.204s">[Knight]</a>: We also have paper 23057 which is really similar subject matter, and that circumstance we had an opinion from the acting city solicitor at the time was in house in our city solicitor will give us an opinion relative to the way that these promotional advancements and salary increases should be implemented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7485.034s">[Knight]</a>: We then received an opinion from KP law and then a revised opinion from KP law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7488.776s">[Knight]</a>: again, KP Lawyers stated that they're not the city's attorney, they're the mayor's private attorney.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7492.479s">[Knight]</a>: They've given us two contrary legal opinions to the standing and acting legal city solicitor at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7497.343s">[Knight]</a>: So, you know, we're kind of in the same circumstance with this paper that we were in the others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7516.277s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7619.924s">[Knight]</a>: No, as previously stated, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7622.245s">[Knight]</a>: I think the gentleman's doing great work, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7623.606s">[Knight]</a>: Don't get me wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8469.41s">[Knight]</a>: I prefer a motion to table till third reading on the underlying ordinance, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8475.43s">[Knight]</a>: Certainly a paper I'm going to support funding if the underlying position passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8490.581s">[Knight]</a>: Those withdraw the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8569.567s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8575.11s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8878.367s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8946.088s">[Knight]</a>: Yes, Madam President, it's been brought to my attention that parking enforcement vehicles aren't garage in the state, even nevermind the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8953.638s">[Knight]</a>: I've seen the vehicles driving around town with the nice fancy city of Medford sticker on it says parking enforcement on it, parking enforcement officers are in it but other vehicles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8962.229s">[Knight]</a>: are not registered in the state of Massachusetts or in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8966.773s">[Knight]</a>: So I believe that was a criteria in our previous contract with Republic Parking, and I see no reason why these vehicles shouldn't be both garaged and insured in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, nevermind the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9051.567s">[Knight]</a>: That was pretty good, all in one breath, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9053.909s">[Knight]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9054.689s">[Knight]</a>: Well, ultimately, it's been brought to my attention that there's been some unauthorized clear-cutting of forestry between the community garden and the dog park, say, going down to the waterfront over by Homel Stadium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9067.859s">[Knight]</a>: It's caused a little bit of disruption to our ecosystem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9071.081s">[Knight]</a>: The matter has been brought to the attention of the Office of Energy and Environment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9075.684s">[Knight]</a>: Dennis McDougal has been involved in the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9080.825s">[Knight]</a>: examination and restoration of the area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9082.826s">[Knight]</a>: The police department has also been contacted relative to the circumstances, but the clear-cutting persists, Madam President, so this is something that I'm hoping we can get ahead of, take a look at, maybe do some intervention, educate some people in the community about the dangers of clear-cutting forestry, especially abutting the Mystic River watershed, and maybe move forward and restore some of the damage that has been done to further beautify the area that's utilized by so many in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9128.122s">[Knight]</a>: That I do not know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9129.082s">[Knight]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9344.552s">[Knight]</a>: So on the motion of Councilor Madam President, Madam President, I'm gonna throw the motion on the questions been asked and answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9349.215s">[Knight]</a>: You know, it seems like everything that we were going to request they've already done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9377.635s">[Knight]</a>: Madam President's rather self explanatory, as you'll know, on ramps and off ramps to 9316 and the like are in some rough shape, and I'm hoping that the dot can come out and give it a little bit of 10 to 11 care to prevent any damage to the resident of cities vehicles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9913.197s">[Knight]</a>: Madam President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9914.378s">[Knight]</a>: I think it's just important to point out that these large scale nonprofits like healthcare institutions and universities also provide a great community benefit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9923.132s">[Knight]</a>: namely jobs that provide a living wage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9926.254s">[Knight]</a>: So we have to also take into consideration the economic benefits that they bring to a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9930.635s">[Knight]</a>: You see communities that have universities located inside them and the benefits that they have economically when the recession hits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9937.858s">[Knight]</a>: So I think it's also important to point out the benefits that come along with having large-scale universities and large-scale healthcare institutions in the community that are non-profit as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10227.02s">[Knight]</a>: Point of information, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10230.303s">[Knight]</a>: I do believe the city and Tufts University have an agreement where all new purchases of parcels outside the campus, the existing campus, would be put on the tax rolls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10407.334s">[Knight]</a>: Madam President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10409.87s">[Knight]</a>: I'd be remiss if we didn't recognize our colleague, Councilor Caraviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10413.713s">[Knight]</a>: It was Councilor Caraviello's resolution under the Burke administration that got us involved in the opioid lawsuit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10420.397s">[Knight]</a>: And without his foresight and vision, we wouldn't be here today receiving these funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10425.141s">[Knight]</a>: So I'd like to thank him for taking the opportunity to be invested in the war on recovery here in our city and the steps that he took to make sure that we received these funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10719.095s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=509.639s">[Knight]</a>: I'd just like to ask Attorney Dash, how are you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=511.16s">[Knight]</a>: Good to see you again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=513.101s">[Knight]</a>: How long have the process has been for the applicants from start to recount?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=516.683s">[Knight]</a>: How long ago did they initiate this process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=521.866s">[Knight]</a>: Four years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=579.583s">[Knight]</a>: Have there been any significant delays coming relative to the legal aspect of this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=583.385s">[Knight]</a>: Because we don't have legal counsel or city solicitors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=585.666s">[Knight]</a>: Well, we were... You've got to wait three days to get somebody to call you back, four days, five days a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=589.867s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, ultimately what I'm hearing is that they started the process four years ago, and at some point it's going to present some sort of economic hardship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=597.094s">[Knight]</a>: And, you know, we can only hold people over a barrel for so long as they try to shake them down in a negotiation going on in another department over here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=604.139s">[Knight]</a>: But if this is just an issue, whether or not the council feels they should change the deed of restriction, I don't see why we should be the ones to hold them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=623.829s">[Knight]</a>: In full disclosure, I live on Movement Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=625.812s">[Knight]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=626.413s">[Knight]</a>: I live at number 200.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=627.354s">[Knight]</a>: I'm probably three football fields, four football fields away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=630.959s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not a direct butterer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=631.86s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not a butterer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=632.38s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not a butterer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=633.181s">[Knight]</a>: But, you know, just in the interest of disclosure, I'd like to say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=637.196s">[Knight]</a>: It's not a motion, it's more of a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=638.457s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, at this point, Councilor, this is my last meeting, I'm a lame duck Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=641.46s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not going to bring any racial items forward at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=644.322s">[Knight]</a>: But, you know, I just kind of find it curious that, you know, it's taken these hardworking individuals in this community four years to get this process really rolling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1447.636s">[Knight]</a>: Madam President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1448.836s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Caraviello is absolutely right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1450.237s">[Knight]</a>: The coverup is always worse than the crime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1453.518s">[Knight]</a>: And Councilor Bearsley is right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1454.938s">[Knight]</a>: Trust in the public process is paramount, especially when it comes to elections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1459.12s">[Knight]</a>: So why is it that we have an elections commission that's going to go hide under their bed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1463.442s">[Knight]</a>: when the largest issue in this community has come up in a very long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1467.845s">[Knight]</a>: I don't understand how an election commission can vote 3 to 1 to postpone reporting back to this community the flaws and errors that occurred during their mismanagement and incompetency following that election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1480.433s">[Knight]</a>: I sat up here the evening of the election, and I heard them read off the figures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1487.257s">[Knight]</a>: I heard them read off the total vote count.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1490.059s">[Knight]</a>: And I said to myself, you're missing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1493.427s">[Knight]</a>: like 4,000 votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1494.828s">[Knight]</a>: You're wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1495.909s">[Knight]</a>: You don't know what you're talking about, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1497.41s">[Knight]</a>: You don't know what you're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1499.271s">[Knight]</a>: I know one plus one equals two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1502.073s">[Knight]</a>: I know one plus one equals two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1503.414s">[Knight]</a>: The way that election was handled was the most embarrassing sight I've seen in a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1508.317s">[Knight]</a>: I worked on political campaigns since I was seven years old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1513.16s">[Knight]</a>: I've never seen anything handled like that before in my life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1515.382s">[Knight]</a>: The elections manager was not in this room the whole entire night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1519.265s">[Knight]</a>: I was here from 8.05 until almost one o'clock in the morning<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1523.433s">[Knight]</a>: And the elections manager was nowhere to be seen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1526.856s">[Knight]</a>: All the vote totals in bags, unattended, all over this room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1531.62s">[Knight]</a>: Individual members of the election commission, unsupervised, alone, going through the bags, looking through them, rifling through them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1538.246s">[Knight]</a>: And you wonder why stuff is going missing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1540.328s">[Knight]</a>: You wonder why we can't put it together, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1542.81s">[Knight]</a>: That was the biggest embarrassment I've ever seen in my life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1547.253s">[Knight]</a>: Now, shockingly, we do have a CEO in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1552.244s">[Knight]</a>: who's been extremely quiet, extremely quiet about what happened during this election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1561.75s">[Knight]</a>: Which leads me to believe that this behavior is something that's acceptable with this current administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1568.494s">[Knight]</a>: Because I know if it were me, and the integrity of my election would be brought into question, I'd be sure that the department heads and the board members<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1581.226s">[Knight]</a>: by way of which I appointed personally, because I'm the mayor, would have their heads rolling down the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1588.873s">[Knight]</a>: The way that they treated election day volunteers, people that wanted to participate in the process and be involved, was shameful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1598.121s">[Knight]</a>: And for them to now vote, to postpone the discussion, just tells you what kind of culture we have here at City Hall, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1610.728s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3099.701s">[Knight]</a>: I would find it very interesting if the mayor could point out when she did become aware of these circumstances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3109.69s">[Knight]</a>: You know, she's remained relatively quiet about it with the exception of a press release<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3114.131s">[Knight]</a>: And historically, that office has been really good at press releases and social media.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3119.856s">[Knight]</a>: So it kind of concerns me, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3121.897s">[Knight]</a>: It makes me scratch my head and wonder if the mayor had knowledge about this before Halloween and didn't share it with the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3129.063s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3815.197s">[Knight]</a>: Madam President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3817.959s">[Knight]</a>: Ricky, first things first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3819.781s">[Knight]</a>: It's your turn to pay at the Mets tomorrow morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3828.548s">[Knight]</a>: I've served on this council for 10 years, and I've never, ever served a year without you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3837.195s">[Knight]</a>: And it's been a great ride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3838.336s">[Knight]</a>: You know, I think back to when I first had the opportunity to meet you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3843.874s">[Knight]</a>: I think I was in kindergarten, I was with your son Richard, running across High Street, going over to Hastings Lane, visiting the house, and you know, a lot's transpired since those times, and now here I am serving with you as a colleague, and I've had the opportunity to not only, you know, spend a lot of time around your family and your children, but also your grandchildren.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3865.777s">[Knight]</a>: And I really think that shows what you're all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3870.218s">[Knight]</a>: You're a true family man, and you're a true throwback to that old school politician.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3876.239s">[Knight]</a>: You're the type of guy that when someone calls you on the phone, you call them back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3880.32s">[Knight]</a>: And if they don't answer the phone, you show up at the door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3882.72s">[Knight]</a>: Because you truly care about people in this community, and you want to make a difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3888.062s">[Knight]</a>: And rest assured, Ricky, you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3890.694s">[Knight]</a>: You really have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3892.034s">[Knight]</a>: You've done an excellent job, and it's been an honor and a privilege to serve with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3897.376s">[Knight]</a>: And it's even more bittersweet to walk out the door with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3902.978s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, thank you very much for your service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3906.479s">[Knight]</a>: I do think that there are a couple of people in this audience that haven't been recognized yet this evening that I know you're going to take a chance to recognize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3916.889s">[Knight]</a>: for the past, what is it, 12 years now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3921.252s">[Knight]</a>: The family's been very good at...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3923.971s">[Knight]</a>: throwing you out of the house, letting you get out here and serve the people of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3929.896s">[Knight]</a>: And what is to be said about a family that's so willing to share such a great man with so many people here in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3939.324s">[Knight]</a>: So thank you, Carol and Lauren and Richard and Nikki for letting us have a piece of Ricky for the past decade plus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6428.459s">[Knight]</a>: Well, Madam President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6431.401s">[Knight]</a>: I didn't realize that subtlety was such a strong suit of mine, but apparently a couple of my colleagues feel so it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6440.689s">[Knight]</a>: Now, who would have thunk it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6442.35s">[Knight]</a>: Back in 2013 when I was elected to the city council and I was the liberal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6453.769s">[Knight]</a>: But thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6455.009s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you for all the kind words that you said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6457.79s">[Knight]</a>: You know, it's kind of weird getting out of the public life, getting out of electoral politics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6464.893s">[Knight]</a>: And, you know, everywhere you go, you have people coming up to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6468.074s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you for your service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6469.095s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you for your service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6470.215s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you for your service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6471.295s">[Knight]</a>: And I'm looking at them like they're crazy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6473.056s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not a veteran.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6474.276s">[Knight]</a>: I don't know what you're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6475.417s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you for your service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6476.837s">[Knight]</a>: It feels wrong to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6479.478s">[Knight]</a>: It feels like I should be the one saying thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6483.078s">[Knight]</a>: truly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6484.439s">[Knight]</a>: Serving the residents of this community as a member of this council has been an honor, truly has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6489.782s">[Knight]</a>: And it's been a great run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6492.064s">[Knight]</a>: I'm very proud of the work that together we've been able to accomplish and very thankful for the friendships I've been able to make along the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6501.029s">[Knight]</a>: You know, I wish the incoming council the best of luck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6505.407s">[Knight]</a>: I thank my past and current colleagues for their service and work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6509.491s">[Knight]</a>: We've had a lot of laughs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6510.632s">[Knight]</a>: We've done a lot of good for this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6512.193s">[Knight]</a>: And we've always kept Medford in the forefront.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6515.876s">[Knight]</a>: To my family, they've been great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6518.658s">[Knight]</a>: Sacrificed a lot to allow me this opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6521.301s">[Knight]</a>: And it's something I'll be forever grateful for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6524.784s">[Knight]</a>: It's nice to see my old colleagues here, my old friends, Councilor Marks and I, at a number<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6532.583s">[Knight]</a>: a number of great debates right in these chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6536.406s">[Knight]</a>: Thank God for TV3, because we can go back and watch them and laugh at what donkeys we were making of ourselves as we picket back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6549.991s">[Knight]</a>: I'm upset that Representative Donato had to leave because I remember back a number of years ago, my grandfather was still with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6556.895s">[Knight]</a>: And I went over to the house all excited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6559.056s">[Knight]</a>: I'm a young kid and I'm working on a political campaign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6561.257s">[Knight]</a>: And I grabbed my grandfather and I'm saying, Hey, grandpa, we got to help this guy, Paul Donato.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6565.619s">[Knight]</a>: He's running for state rep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6566.639s">[Knight]</a>: And you know, he's my friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6567.58s">[Knight]</a>: And Donato, guy's a bum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6571.77s">[Knight]</a>: What do you mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6572.73s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not supporting Donato.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6574.071s">[Knight]</a>: It's a grip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6574.511s">[Knight]</a>: What are you talking about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6575.331s">[Knight]</a>: Now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6575.451s">[Knight]</a>: This is, you know, 2000 or so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6578.191s">[Knight]</a>: It's a grip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6578.611s">[Knight]</a>: What are you talking about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6579.312s">[Knight]</a>: He ran against my friend Dennis McKenna in 1982.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6581.512s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not supporting that guy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6584.933s">[Knight]</a>: So if that tells you anything about the Knights in the way that we approach politics, you know, sometimes we have a long memory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6595.335s">[Knight]</a>: But with that being said, this has been a job that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6600.512s">[Knight]</a>: I had never considered work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6602.553s">[Knight]</a>: I considered it something that I love to do, a form of service and an opportunity for me to give back to a city that's given me so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6614.396s">[Knight]</a>: Sitting here tonight, being able to reflect on all the good that we've been able to accomplish together is truly rewarding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6620.317s">[Knight]</a>: I thank you all for being here this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6623.968s">[Knight]</a>: the people that put me in the seat, because without them, it never would have been possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6628.91s">[Knight]</a>: Most importantly, though, I do have to, again, reiterate thanks to my family and my campaign team for all the work that they put forward over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6637.414s">[Knight]</a>: It's a very difficult job, and there's two jobs when you get involved in this type of business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6642.536s">[Knight]</a>: And if you don't do the first job good, it doesn't matter how good you are at the second job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6646.898s">[Knight]</a>: And the first job is getting elected, and nobody can do that alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6650.399s">[Knight]</a>: And you're only as good as the team that you have around you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6654.019s">[Knight]</a>: You get elected, and you get in the seat, and then you've got to earn your bonus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6657.861s">[Knight]</a>: But if you can't do the first job right, you're never going to be able to get a chance to do the second job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6662.603s">[Knight]</a>: And my campaign committee worked tirelessly, tirelessly, over the last decade to ensure that I had this opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6669.907s">[Knight]</a>: And for that, I will be photographed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6960.384s">[Knight]</a>: Praise me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6961.084s">[Knight]</a>: Praise me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7711.144s">[Knight]</a>: I got something here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7712.285s">[Knight]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7713.245s">[Knight]</a>: Is there any water in this thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7714.226s">[Knight]</a>: This is going to be long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7721.49s">[Knight]</a>: Madam President, congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7724.412s">[Knight]</a>: It's been a great run as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7726.913s">[Knight]</a>: Maybe not as long as Councilor Caraviello and I, but that's because you chose to not make it that long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7732.616s">[Knight]</a>: You could have served in the city council for as long as you felt like it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7736.418s">[Knight]</a>: I don't know if you guys know this,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7740.37s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Morell might be a tad competitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7743.004s">[Knight]</a>: She doesn't show it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7744.144s">[Knight]</a>: but she might be a tad competitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7748.107s">[Knight]</a>: Very tenacious on the campaign trail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7750.67s">[Knight]</a>: I've talked to several of my neighbors and they said they voted for her just because she wouldn't get off her porch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7754.773s">[Knight]</a>: She's going to have to vote for her because she keeps coming back and she won't get off her porch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7760.938s">[Knight]</a>: And that strategy worked out very well for the council, as evident by her vote totals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7766.763s">[Knight]</a>: And when she first got elected to the council after<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7771.027s">[Knight]</a>: her first foray into public office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7774.089s">[Knight]</a>: We had a nice discussion when she came up here and we invited her up as a councilor-elect to observe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7779.451s">[Knight]</a>: And I said to Nicole, she had a very, very, very important decision that she had to make that's gonna shape her future here on the Medford City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7788.556s">[Knight]</a>: This decision that she makes is probably gonna be the most important decision that she makes as a city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7794.419s">[Knight]</a>: And she had to choose where she wanted to sit, next to me or next to Councilor Marks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7801.247s">[Knight]</a>: And apparently, subtlety is not one of her strong spots either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7814.135s">[Knight]</a>: And I lost out on that one, Councilor Marks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7819.438s">[Knight]</a>: And since that time, she tells me that your private whisper conversations with Councilor Bears aren't whispers at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7825.801s">[Knight]</a>: I can hear you all the way over here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7831.129s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, congratulations, Councilor Marks, you're responsible for helping shape and mold our president right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7840.052s">[Knight]</a>: But as I sit here and I see you there, and don't take this the wrong way, Councilor, but I feel as though your talents are wasted at the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7848.415s">[Knight]</a>: You're an excellent city councilor, very capable on the council floor and a very formidable debater.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7853.321s">[Knight]</a>: I enjoyed the time where you'd step away from the chair and step down on the floor because you always brought forward well thought out arguments that were rooted in fact, not fiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7865.036s">[Knight]</a>: that was supported by Data Not Drama.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7868.739s">[Knight]</a>: And that helps move this body along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7870.66s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, thank you very much for your approach to the office and for the way that you handle yourself and tried to handle this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7878.846s">[Knight]</a>: It's impossible to hurt a bag of cats and you did the best you can with what you got here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7884.39s">[Knight]</a>: You know, we've had some great, we've had some great meetings and we've had, we've had some, some very,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7890.914s">[Knight]</a>: very, what we could say, colorful meetings over the past four years, and you've handled yourself with great dignity and great respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7898.861s">[Knight]</a>: You've carried yourself in a fashion that's admirable, and you're certainly worthy to wield that gavel and worthy to carry the title Councilor, and it's been an honor and a privilege to serve with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8067.744s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Marks, on that topic, can you tell us what you made when you were in the school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=416.638s">[Knight]</a>: Excuse me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=417.098s">[Knight]</a>: These are mandatory topics of bargaining, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=420.301s">[Knight]</a>: Yeah, so you guys should be taking care of this at the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=428.862s">[Knight]</a>: You guys need to enact your rights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=431.343s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, you know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=432.703s">[Knight]</a>: You have rights under the- I don't get it, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=438.164s">[Knight]</a>: Amy, time out here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=438.944s">[Knight]</a>: Time out here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=439.444s">[Knight]</a>: We're not the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=440.264s">[Knight]</a>: We don't negotiate contracts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=441.344s">[Knight]</a>: That's the job of the chief of staff per ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=443.605s">[Knight]</a>: All right, now, I haven't seen the chief of staff in a contract negotiation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=446.105s">[Knight]</a>: That's a whole different story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=446.985s">[Knight]</a>: We have KP Law doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=459.096s">[Knight]</a>: Yeah, I agree with you there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=461.059s">[Knight]</a>: But these are mandatory topics of bargaining.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=462.741s">[Knight]</a>: So when the administration is, you know, depleting the number of membership, the number of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=470.754s">[Knight]</a>: employees that are in the membership, you have to look at the work that's being performed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=473.696s">[Knight]</a>: And if the work that's being performed by an employee that's actually union workers, not in the union, they didn't bring the city up on charges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=479.52s">[Knight]</a>: You know, we've seen time and time again in this community, the level of respect that's given to organized labor by this administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=486.024s">[Knight]</a>: All right, and it's lacking, it's lacking and never before and I mean, I've worked in local government now for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=491.727s">[Knight]</a>: Shoot, since 1999, I represented union workers all across the Commonwealth from Worcester County to Springfield and back, all right, state, local.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=499.971s">[Knight]</a>: And I've never seen anything like this before, where employees are treated like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=503.693s">[Knight]</a>: And, you know, I just,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=507.367s">[Knight]</a>: I'm afraid for you for being up here right now, tonight and speaking out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=510.528s">[Knight]</a>: I'm afraid for you right now from being up here and speaking out tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=526.515s">[Knight]</a>: And the reason I say I'm scared for you right now is because I could go down a list of people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=530.78s">[Knight]</a>: have got they've gotten rid of come up here to this microphone and they've spoken out against some injustice, the councils agree with them, and those people are gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=537.443s">[Knight]</a>: So we look at Brian Karen's Mike for ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=540.004s">[Knight]</a>: Mike Durham, Aleesha Nunley, Molly kibbe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=543.146s">[Knight]</a>: That's five people, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=544.386s">[Knight]</a>: That's five people, five people with families, five people who need health insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=549.429s">[Knight]</a>: Five people that committed to work for this community that came up here and spoke on behalf of the people and the taxpayers and the world let go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=555.441s">[Knight]</a>: I applaud you for your courage, Amy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=556.682s">[Knight]</a>: I do applaud you for the courage that you have for coming up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=558.924s">[Knight]</a>: I think a lot of this stuff really is mandatory topics of bargaining and mandatory topics of negotiation that need to be addressed at the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=564.368s">[Knight]</a>: I agree with you that the actions of this body and the vote that some people take, given these people raises, there's no question about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=569.812s">[Knight]</a>: The council needs to fund this, the mayor needs to propose it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=571.714s">[Knight]</a>: And the mayor did propose a significant pay hike for a number of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=575.617s">[Knight]</a>: What's the number councilor Bears?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=576.698s">[Knight]</a>: I believe it was 16 requests have been made so far for reclassification of positions and the council is- 18, we rejected 16.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=583.543s">[Knight]</a>: 18, we rejected 16.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=596.614s">[Knight]</a>: I hear you, and you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=598.796s">[Knight]</a>: When nobody listens to us at this meeting, tonight's the night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=602.359s">[Knight]</a>: It's our go-to, all right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=604.041s">[Knight]</a>: Because for a year, we've been sitting there, and we've been saying that we need certain tools in the toolbox to do a job for these people in this community, including you, including the workers in the city hall, and we haven't been given them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=613.049s">[Knight]</a>: We haven't been given the tools that we need to do the job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=615.11s">[Knight]</a>: And tonight is gonna be a day of reckoning because I don't think there's anybody behind this rail based upon the debates that I've listened to that's happy with the direction that this community is going in, that's happy with the way that we've been treated, that's happy with the way employees have been treated in this community, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=627.816s">[Knight]</a>: And I think that's safe to say, nobody behind this rail based upon the commentary and the minutes that have been approved by this body, that nobody behind this rail is happy with the direction this community is going in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=636.9s">[Knight]</a>: All right, so think about how frustrated you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=638.501s">[Knight]</a>: Now think about how frustrated we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=640.842s">[Knight]</a>: We're the last stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=642.024s">[Knight]</a>: You come to us for help and we can't get answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=644.788s">[Knight]</a>: The only time we can get answers is from January 1st to, you know, maybe, maybe, sorry, June 1st to June 31st, June 30th, you know, right at the, right at the close of the fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=653.801s">[Knight]</a>: That's when we get answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=656.172s">[Knight]</a>: Hi, Camilla.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=657.572s">[Knight]</a>: Good, good to see you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=769.226s">[Knight]</a>: Well, here's the problem, Camilla.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=770.447s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, ultimately, you want to time out point of information, you ask the question, let me answer it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=775.85s">[Knight]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=776.05s">[Knight]</a>: So you want to know where you can go and where you can turn, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=778.052s">[Knight]</a>: I'd say I'd say turn to the city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=780.373s">[Knight]</a>: But we don't have a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=781.554s">[Knight]</a>: We have no we have nobody in the law department that's here represent the interest of the taxpayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=934.246s">[Knight]</a>: Well, Amy, I think that's inaccurate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=937.41s">[Knight]</a>: The raises that have been, the raises that you're referring to have already been passed and they've already been funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=942.457s">[Knight]</a>: So regardless of whether or not this budget passed, these pay scales established by ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=947.731s">[Knight]</a>: everything except for I think Mary's position, the one that you referred to, because that hasn't been passed by ordinance and the human resources position that they keep ignoring us on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=955.795s">[Knight]</a>: But ultimately, these classifications for non-union titles and the cost of living adjustment that's attached there too, was passed by this body, not unanimously, but it was passed by this body and it was funded by this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=981.371s">[Knight]</a>: Right, but you have the power to negotiate in these non-union policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1007.591s">[Knight]</a>: So just a question so the negotiations between the clerical union and the administration I'm going well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1014.966s">[Knight]</a>: Really, no, I'm just thinking back to when the mayor put her budget presentation on opening night, and she said how great negotiations are going with all the negotiations and how close they were to settle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1286.282s">[Knight]</a>: Amy, the council did also in that proposal that was given to us, the mayor didn't tell us what classifications were included in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1291.865s">[Knight]</a>: And then when we did an investigation and we looked into it, we found that the executive was included in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1297.187s">[Knight]</a>: The mayor proposed a raise for herself in that proposal and we cut that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1301.109s">[Knight]</a>: And the mayor had also proposed a raise for the council and we cut that raise out as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1305.071s">[Knight]</a>: You know what I mean, to stand by what we've said that you know what I mean, rising tide floats all ships and we think that you guys should go so...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1324.408s">[Knight]</a>: Again, these are cost of living adjustments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1325.889s">[Knight]</a>: They're not performance-based.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1329.049s">[Knight]</a>: Right, but you're in a union, so you gotta negotiate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1331.43s">[Knight]</a>: They don't, you know, you have a collective bargaining.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1707.119s">[Knight]</a>: And I just want to just be on that point we did that last year Amy we did that at what one o'clock in the morning the mayor came up here in the magic money tree in her that grows in her office she shook it bunch of money fell out of it next thing you know we were going to get a lawyer that was going to come and help us out with zoning never happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1720.783s">[Knight]</a>: What else we're going to get out of that deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1723.104s">[Knight]</a>: City solicitor yeah assistant city solicitor the city council, never happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1726.885s">[Knight]</a>: Well, it's something else was supposed to come out of that too I think but you know what I mean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1729.946s">[Knight]</a>: And then the way that they were going to fund all of these promises that they made to the council was they were going to take the money out of the negotiated salaries account, which is the account that they use to fund your raises.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1737.873s">[Knight]</a>: And this council said, no, you're not taking the money out of that account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1740.775s">[Knight]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1741.115s">[Knight]</a>: So if you want to find magic money, you better find it somewhere else because you're not balancing this budget on the back of the working people in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1746.84s">[Knight]</a>: And the mayor went and took the money out of the public utility account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1749.382s">[Knight]</a>: So now we look at the transfers that are on the agenda this evening, we'll see hundreds of thousands of dollars in transfers so that we can pay to keep the lights on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2595.906s">[Knight]</a>: I'm just a little confused as to what leads us to mediation, because usually you go to mediation when you no longer can sit at the table anymore and make any forward progress, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2604.671s">[Knight]</a>: So mediation means you're at a stalemate at this point in time, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2608.032s">[Knight]</a>: You've reached what's called an impasse, is the negotiating term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2611.514s">[Knight]</a>: You've reached an impasse in negotiations, and we can no longer move further or backwards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2615.836s">[Knight]</a>: So my question is, if you're working with these unions and these employee groups, how have we gotten to a point where at impasse with multiple groups, if in fact we are working with them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2624.684s">[Knight]</a>: Because it doesn't make sense to me if we're going to mediation to a third party negotiator, a third party to handle our negotiations, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2630.928s">[Knight]</a>: Outside person, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2633.609s">[Knight]</a>: Through mediation because we reached impasse, that doesn't sound to me like the definition of working together with somebody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2638.292s">[Knight]</a>: So I'd just like to get a response from the chief of staff because she always likes to answer questions and provide points of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2643.755s">[Knight]</a>: So I'd like to ask the chief of staff, what got us to this point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2646.137s">[Knight]</a>: Why are we at a point of impasse when these contracts have been open now since this administration got elected?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2702.302s">[Knight]</a>: My question is this, is Feinberg, Dumont, and Brennan an employee organization?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2706.104s">[Knight]</a>: they're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2706.584s">[Knight]</a>: And Feinberg, Dumont, and Brennan is a law office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2708.966s">[Knight]</a>: They're a law office that also works with Local 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2710.767s">[Knight]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2711.867s">[Knight]</a>: So the way that this works is if you're going to decertify from a union, they're a member of the SEIU and they want to decertify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2716.97s">[Knight]</a>: You can't decertify when your contract is active.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2719.772s">[Knight]</a>: So what happens was the union said, we're going to decertify from SEIU.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2723.614s">[Knight]</a>: And they did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2724.174s">[Knight]</a>: And they picked up private representation because there's a cooling off period that's necessary before they can apply with another union.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2730.41s">[Knight]</a>: But nothing precluded them from going to the table and negotiating once they decertified from SEIU and once that contract was open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2755.315s">[Knight]</a>: Madam President, I just like to know what the timeline is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2759.636s">[Knight]</a>: I just like to know what the timeline is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2760.716s">[Knight]</a>: I'm just asking a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2874.104s">[Knight]</a>: point of information that men present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2875.906s">[Knight]</a>: I do believe the council asked for a legal opinion as to whether or not that paper was posed with an and sound ethical footing, because what happened was the mayor asked the council to actually approve its own raise and erase for herself in the same year that they perceive it, we never received a response to that so if Nina could follow up on that, that would be good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2898.048s">[Knight]</a>: question Madam President on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2899.609s">[Knight]</a>: Can you just tell me who represents the city in the collective bargaining sessions can the chief of staff tell you who represents the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2909.633s">[Knight]</a>: Yeah, yeah, whoever that's her name Yeah, that'd be fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2914.715s">[Knight]</a>: Who represents who represents the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2936.576s">[Knight]</a>: And just on that note, Madam President, the administration's well aware of city ordinance section 2-680.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2944.281s">[Knight]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2946.742s">[Knight]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2947.283s">[Knight]</a>: And part of that ordinance does read that the chief of staff shall be responsible for representing the mayor and I'll collect the bargaining sessions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2955.973s">[Knight]</a>: Is the Chief of Staff employed by KP Law?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2960.681s">[Knight]</a>: Is the Chief of Staff KP Law?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2996.849s">[Knight]</a>: Madam President, on that point, the Chief of Staff is wrong in her reading of the ordinance because that was not the legislative intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3005.031s">[Knight]</a>: And I can speak to that personally because I voted for it in 2016 when it came up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3010.133s">[Knight]</a>: I was a part of this body at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3014.215s">[Knight]</a>: So a reading of it is incorrect and is not in line with the legislative intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3017.877s">[Knight]</a>: And I think that any other member of this council that was on the body in 2016 can also concur with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3022.5s">[Knight]</a>: All right, so the way I'm looking at this now is we have an essential function and essential duty of the chief of staff that's been taken away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3030.125s">[Knight]</a>: The salary is still $135,000, but an essential function, essential duty has been taken away and it's been farmed out to a third party, private third party law firm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3039.602s">[Knight]</a>: That's an expense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3041.043s">[Knight]</a>: So when we sit down and we talk about why the council needs a city solicitor, it's to control these expenses and these wasteful spending habits that this administration has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3049.766s">[Knight]</a>: So when we look at the chief of staff's title in the ordinance that supports the job that you're supposed to do, and we'll go through it, the majority of the duties have been taken away, but yet the salary remains the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3063.612s">[Knight]</a>: So when I hear members of our clerical union get up here and quite frankly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3069.758s">[Knight]</a>: properly express dissatisfaction and disgust because they've been out of the contract for 48 months and then listen to the chief of staff come up here and try to explain our way out of the fact that it's because they're not able to sit down at the table and negotiate properly and then try to spin it by saying that they're precluded from doing it when I know for a fact they're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3089.488s">[Knight]</a>: It's just bizarre to me, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3091.009s">[Knight]</a>: And I feel like what it is is it's for the cameras and it's not for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3095.311s">[Knight]</a>: And it's to portray a picture and control a narrative that's not a reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3100.08s">[Knight]</a>: So that's where I am with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3101.421s">[Knight]</a>: I thank the chief of staff and president of the clerical union, Mr. Naglia, for being up here this evening and sharing with us their insight on such an important topic in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3113.247s">[Knight]</a>: And I am going to what I'd call use my reasonable deduction to determine who's being more truthful than not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3735.799s">[Knight]</a>: I just like to join Council Scarpelli and offer my condolences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3739.001s">[Knight]</a>: Although I didn't know Fred, as well as George that I do remember him from a very young age, when I was involved in Methodist soccer, and I also had the opportunity to go to college with the sun Steve, and what a good kid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3753.309s">[Knight]</a>: Freddie Rita was just a nice guy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3754.529s">[Knight]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3755.229s">[Knight]</a>: George hit the nail right on the head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3756.89s">[Knight]</a>: He was someone that wasn't afraid to put himself, put the community before himself and put himself out there to do the work, roll up his sleeves, get dirty and not seek an ounce of credit for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3767.574s">[Knight]</a>: He was a great man.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3768.795s">[Knight]</a>: Like you said, great family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3770.195s">[Knight]</a>: And I joined my council colleague and extending my deep condolences to the family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4447.863s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4449.124s">[Knight]</a>: Was the mailing done, Madam President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4469.541s">[Knight]</a>: How far out did those notices go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4470.922s">[Knight]</a>: I know Mayor Longo, when she was a council, wanted to expand it to like 11 miles from where they were doing the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4491.921s">[Knight]</a>: It was 300 feet by law and then Mayor Lungo when she was a councilor wanted to expand that I think to 1000 or 600 or something like that and then it got passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4503.248s">[Knight]</a>: But then I don't think it's been a practice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4505.769s">[Knight]</a>: Administration change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4533.383s">[Knight]</a>: And then I just have one more question, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4536.186s">[Knight]</a>: The process that Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4540.349s">[Knight]</a>: Evans has outlined this evening, has that been reviewed by legal and been approved by legal as the proper way to enact such a measure that's before the body this evening?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4562.415s">[Knight]</a>: What I'm hearing is, you know, based upon a new zoning, the city council is not required to do this, this, this and this and now we have a special permit granting authority pursuant to this and so forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4571.297s">[Knight]</a>: This is the first time we've seen one of these papers before us where we're the site plan review granting authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4576.919s">[Knight]</a>: So my question was whether or not this procedural aspect was reviewed by legal counsel to ensure that we're in compliance with our own ordinance that we draft<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4600.463s">[Knight]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4601.044s">[Knight]</a>: So the council approved it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4602.205s">[Knight]</a>: Now, we have a process that's in place as this process been reviewed by legal to ensure that it complies with what we put together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4643.624s">[Knight]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4644.024s">[Knight]</a>: And what I'm doing is asking whether or not because the council hasn't seen one of these and so many things have come through in so many years that this process that's being established now for the first time in so many years is legally sound.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4662.293s">[Knight]</a>: Okay and we've conferred with him and he says this is the way we do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4670.156s">[Knight]</a>: So no we haven't conferred with legal as to whether or not this is the way that we do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4677.857s">[Knight]</a>: and said this is the process that we're going to do I have we not I don't know why every question we ask, it's a yes or no question gets 6,000 different answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5294.326s">[Knight]</a>: Point of information, Madam President, before he starts, I just want to go back to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5297.388s">[Knight]</a>: So Attorney Desmond, the proposal is that all your deliveries are going to take place between 12 o'clock and 9 1 o'clock in the morning in a in a location that abuts a residential neighborhood between 11 to 12 for Sunday through Thursday and not every evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5317.097s">[Knight]</a>: It's not working out so great, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5353.613s">[Knight]</a>: And when you went before the CD board this proposal of eliminating the loading dock and then telling them that you're going to apply for a special permit before us to have the loading take place after hours was presented to them in that fashion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5367.318s">[Knight]</a>: It was, and that was something that they supported.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5488.67s">[Knight]</a>: Does the applicant intend to apply for a license for an illuminated light or permit for an illuminated light sign?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5511.764s">[Knight]</a>: I'm assuming you'd want the light to light up if you guys want to be open to one o'clock in the morning on the weekends, you don't want people driving by it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5516.871s">[Knight]</a>: Yeah, but there's also houses across the street, people that live there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5596.729s">[Knight]</a>: Are there any new curb cuts that will be made from either Riverside Ave or the Fellsway to gain access to the property as part of the site plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5605.552s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5740.192s">[Knight]</a>: So, what you're telling me is that you're going to guarantee that these trucks that are delivering are going to follow this route every single time that they come here at 12 o'clock at night, three times a week or four times a week that they do it from now until the end of time as long as we have this permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5866.943s">[Knight]</a>: Because you did say they were going to be coming from Taunton, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5869.745s">[Knight]</a>: So it's guaranteed their first stop is Medford every time, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5873.108s">[Knight]</a>: Because they're coming from, I mean, those are the variables that I'm talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5876.19s">[Knight]</a>: It's like, there's no way we can guarantee that they're going to take the same route every time and go in there the same way every time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5923.606s">[Knight]</a>: And then you spoke about a couple of other Raising Canes that have very similar patterns, I guess, here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5928.551s">[Knight]</a>: So is it their model that they don't have loading docks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5932.414s">[Knight]</a>: Any of that sort?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5939.321s">[Knight]</a>: I don't care about out of state just yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6002.888s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, they're efficient plans for the business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6005.54s">[Knight]</a>: But there might not be efficient plans for the residents that live in the neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6008.422s">[Knight]</a>: And I think that's the number one concern right is the abundance right the people live across the street we have residents on Riverside we have residents across middle sector residents on the phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6016.646s">[Knight]</a>: And that's where I'm coming from on this but I appreciate it I'm not gonna keep saying we got residents live across the street I think you get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6345.923s">[Knight]</a>: Just one more question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6347.785s">[Knight]</a>: Estimated number of vehicle trips per day to the store?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6351.009s">[Knight]</a>: Per day?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6352.19s">[Knight]</a>: No, per week or whatever you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6353.331s">[Knight]</a>: I can do math.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6467.486s">[Knight]</a>: Based upon my math, that's like an average hour, we're looking at 1.8 to 1.9 vehicles in and out every hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6479.129s">[Knight]</a>: I'm sorry, every minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6480.809s">[Knight]</a>: Every minute, every minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6482.689s">[Knight]</a>: 1.9 every minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6486.75s">[Knight]</a>: Yeah, 114 divided by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9891.985s">[Knight]</a>: Does that fall in the parameters of 41 a 65 days right from when we receive it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9904.329s">[Knight]</a>: Yeah, we keep the public hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9920.493s">[Knight]</a>: I think Councilor Bears might have some, he wants to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9958.779s">[Knight]</a>: I didn't make a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9962.102s">[Knight]</a>: All I said was I don't want to wait the six day waiting period and I don't support voting on it until the six day waiting period is over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9993.084s">[Knight]</a>: Suppose Madam President, where it's a special permit, the special permit should go with the business and not with the address as well, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10065.39s">[Knight]</a>: We already have that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10066.631s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not in favor of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10067.971s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not putting any restrictions on it because I'm voting no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10208.362s">[Knight]</a>: Right, so we can't put restrictions on a special permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10211.164s">[Knight]</a>: Can you put restrictions on site plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10220.992s">[Knight]</a>: Did that come from Alicia or did that come from a lawyer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10223.614s">[Knight]</a>: That came from the Community Development Board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10230.053s">[Knight]</a>: That's why I asked the question initially, Madam President, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10233.116s">[Knight]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10233.617s">[Knight]</a>: At the end of the day, we need to make sure we're making decisions that are legally sound and strong footing and foundation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10239.382s">[Knight]</a>: We don't have that opportunity with this administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10241.625s">[Knight]</a>: We haven't had it for three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10255.998s">[Knight]</a>: At this rate, Madam President, this thing will pass with a constructive passage because we'll never take a vote on it the way that this administration is with us when it comes to giving us legal opinions and legal advice and access to legal counsel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10267.963s">[Knight]</a>: We can't put this on the table pending a legal opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10269.924s">[Knight]</a>: We'll never get one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10288.719s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, and we did it with BJ's too and then we got advice and then that advice ended up getting us taken to court again and then they called and said, what do you want us to do now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10295.885s">[Knight]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10296.345s">[Knight]</a>: It's like, it's just a, it's a comedy of errors in terms of the representation that we received legally here in the community, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10302.629s">[Knight]</a>: It puts us at a very significant disadvantage when it comes to making issues, making decisions on issues like this that will have a vast impact on the quality of life of the people that are about us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10313.197s">[Knight]</a>: All right, so I don't blame Raising Cane's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10314.598s">[Knight]</a>: I thank Raising Cane's for coming here and wanting to invest in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10317.98s">[Knight]</a>: All right, but the problem that I have is that the administration's not providing us with the tools to make informed and well-sounded decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10323.784s">[Knight]</a>: Okay, so at the end of the day, what happens?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10325.665s">[Knight]</a>: Who suffers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10326.546s">[Knight]</a>: The residents in this community, the taxpayers in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10329.108s">[Knight]</a>: Why do they suffer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10330.068s">[Knight]</a>: Because we're not able to make determinations that are going to impact things like growth, which is probably the most important thing in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10335.712s">[Knight]</a>: So we get a letter that comes out, we get a newspaper article from the Boston Globe that says, you know, Medford's the fastest growing community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10341.397s">[Knight]</a>: It can grow fast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10342.898s">[Knight]</a>: The question is whether or not it's desirable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10346.361s">[Knight]</a>: Is it a desirable place to live?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10348.583s">[Knight]</a>: I don't see Medford as being desirable right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10350.504s">[Knight]</a>: It might be growing fast, but I don't see it as desirable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10353.126s">[Knight]</a>: And part of the reason that I don't see it as desirable is because the elected officials in this community aren't treated with respect or given the tools that they need to do their job properly and ensure that the taxpayers' rights are protected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10364.215s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, Madam President, when it comes down to this paper that's before us this evening, it's something that I can't support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10370.238s">[Knight]</a>: You know, we talk about economic development and growth here in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10373.9s">[Knight]</a>: We had the opportunity to bring in a 300 plus million dollar development on Boston Ave, life science and biotech.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10381.184s">[Knight]</a>: It gets blown up by the administration, but we get chicken fingers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10384.125s">[Knight]</a>: We get chicken fingers, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10385.286s">[Knight]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10386.026s">[Knight]</a>: So that's the vision that we have in this community right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10387.967s">[Knight]</a>: That's the vision that we have when it comes to economic development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10390.889s">[Knight]</a>: Fast food restaurants, nail salons, Dunkin' Donuts, banks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10394.568s">[Knight]</a>: All right, we don't create jobs that bring a living wage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10398.153s">[Knight]</a>: We don't create jobs that provide health insurance for individuals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10401.177s">[Knight]</a>: When we're looking at this job model here, this position, this entity that's coming before us here, the job that it's gonna create aren't gonna pay people a living wage, not gonna pay them enough money to live in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10411.005s">[Knight]</a>: I have serious and significant concerns about a two-lane highway drive-through where people in flag waver outfits are going to be out there waving people through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10418.426s">[Knight]</a>: I have serious concerns about an illuminated sign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10421.907s">[Knight]</a>: I have serious concerns about noise traffic and product drop-off, especially with the extended hours in an area that's abutting a residential neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10430.308s">[Knight]</a>: You know, these are the reasons that I'm not going to support the bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10434.429s">[Knight]</a>: And I thank you for inviting me and providing me the opportunity to explain my vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10479.64s">[Knight]</a>: I'd just like the record to reflect Madam President that all these votes this evening are being taken without the advice of legal counsel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10725.063s">[Knight]</a>: Question, Madam President, why wouldn't the same restrictions relative to the permit going with the business and the reviews be attached to this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10733.03s">[Knight]</a>: They should be, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10953.253s">[Knight]</a>: I just question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11341.367s">[Knight]</a>: This was something that was brought to my attention by the many retirees in the city of Medford after an alert was sent out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11347.114s">[Knight]</a>: by PARAC and the Massachusetts State Retirement Board, saying that the city of Medford hasn't fully funded its cost of living adjustment capabilities for the upcoming fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11357.119s">[Knight]</a>: So as we see in this ordinance, I'm sorry, in this resolution, Madam President, the Massachusetts State Legislature, in its divine wisdom, did allow municipalities the local option to increase the cost of living adjustment for retirees to 5%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11370.485s">[Knight]</a>: It allows us to add an additional 2%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11373.867s">[Knight]</a>: Now, when we look at the cost of living adjustment that was given to retirees this year, it's actually higher than the 2% standard that the administration has put in place and in effect as the standard cost of living adjustment for active employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11384.012s">[Knight]</a>: However, we do have an opportunity, Madam President, for us to take a leap forward and take care of some of the retirees, the people that worked here in this community for a number of years,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11393.177s">[Knight]</a>: that made meant for the great place that it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11395.117s">[Knight]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11395.838s">[Knight]</a>: So when I look at this paper, what the request is, is to ask the administration to send us the request so that we can approve this document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11403.739s">[Knight]</a>: There's a two part process for which this needs to be approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11408.4s">[Knight]</a>: And the first is the retirement board and the second is the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11411.721s">[Knight]</a>: So I'm asking that the city administration, retirement board, which falls under the purview of the executive, takes the necessary steps to ensure that our retirees are taken care of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11422.827s">[Knight]</a>: We hear a lot of people come up to these microphones and talk how much they value the employees and what a great job they do and how much they care about the community and how wonderful all these people were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11430.975s">[Knight]</a>: Well, show it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11431.736s">[Knight]</a>: Put your money where your mouth is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11434.091s">[Knight]</a>: know, I'm sure there'll be another narrative or another reason why this can't happen, Madam President, you know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11438.693s">[Knight]</a>: And it's probably going to be rooted in not logic or reality, but what's going to control the spin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11443.976s">[Knight]</a>: But ultimately, at the end of the day, this is the right thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11446.697s">[Knight]</a>: All right, these people are on fixed incomes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11449.018s">[Knight]</a>: Okay, many of them live in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11451.759s">[Knight]</a>: They're all elderly, they've reached retirement age.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11453.92s">[Knight]</a>: And if they reach retirement age that means they've put in at least 10 years of employment and service to the general public and the taxpayers of this community and they deserve to be respected, and they deserve to be rewarded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11463.867s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, Madam President asked my council colleagues to support this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11714.073s">[Knight]</a>: When the elections manager was up here, they had put this on our agenda, and they had tried to make us vote to support the proposal that they put forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11723.143s">[Knight]</a>: But they said that the council doesn't need to support this proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11725.545s">[Knight]</a>: They were just putting us on there to make us aware of it, to put us in a position to support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11729.91s">[Knight]</a>: We didn't support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11731.171s">[Knight]</a>: We sent it back and we asked them to make those changes, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11733.533s">[Knight]</a>: So now we need an official paper from them saying that the Elections Commission has made this policy change, send it back to us and put it on the agenda just like they did previously, unless they're not going to be transparent this time around, because they had to change their mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11798.188s">[Knight]</a>: I'd appreciate a waiver of the remaining of the reader I think we need some bottom line there at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11816.445s">[Knight]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11819.949s">[Knight]</a>: This evening we got, I believe our third and fourth budgets from the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11825.195s">[Knight]</a>: We didn't get the I didn't see the press release that went out about how the administration's put out<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11829.059s">[Knight]</a>: three more budgets since the initial one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11831.301s">[Knight]</a>: But, you know, today at two o'clock, and again at six o'clock we got two additional budgets, right with updates or amendments or reallocations, and I'm wondering if the paper that before us this evening reflects those changes that have been made by the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11912.409s">[Knight]</a>: Did the mayor meet with any of the councils personally in our office to discuss this budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11917.274s">[Knight]</a>: Or on the telephone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11918.575s">[Knight]</a>: Or you for that matter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11922.679s">[Knight]</a>: Did you meet with any member of this elected body individually to discuss the budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11932.495s">[Knight]</a>: It's not a trick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11961.55s">[Knight]</a>: So these conversations were outside the scope of the public forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12029.508s">[Knight]</a>: It's on that point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12031.731s">[Knight]</a>: So I'm looking at this paper and it says that this was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12034.537s">[Knight]</a>: the mayor's fiscal year budget amended on 6 14 23.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12036.318s">[Knight]</a>: Today 6 2023.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12036.798s">[Knight]</a>: We've gotten two emails from you wanted six o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12041.519s">[Knight]</a>: I wanted two o'clock today that further amends the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12044.5s">[Knight]</a>: So what you're telling me now is that the paper that's before us that was amended on 6 15 reflects those amendments that you sent us on 6 20.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12139.565s">[Knight]</a>: I did I was just gonna say on that point in these other communities normally when financial data is requested from the legislative body they receive it they're not told that they can't get it even though the ordinance says it should be providing it that the book should be provided to the Council upon request, you know, so you know when we talk about what they do other places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12156.797s">[Knight]</a>: Let's talk about the good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12158.478s">[Knight]</a>: But let's talk about the bad that we do here too because what other places do we don't do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12543.797s">[Knight]</a>: So why do we have a meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12633.989s">[Knight]</a>: Just a quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12634.809s">[Knight]</a>: When did the mayor determine that it was time to have a discussion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12644.095s">[Knight]</a>: Absent a vote of the council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12650.179s">[Knight]</a>: Not as the leadership team, as council of business noted earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12660.015s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not trying to trip you up I'm just saying as the elected president I had the same issue with john Falco, and I got my ass kicked for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12665.897s">[Knight]</a>: But I called him out on it, and I got a beating on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12667.918s">[Knight]</a>: You know what I mean, because I like the president to represent the interest of the body not the interest of yourself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12673.379s">[Knight]</a>: So when you get elected president of the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12676.0s">[Knight]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12678.101s">[Knight]</a>: different responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12679.502s">[Knight]</a>: You have responsibility to the people buying this realtor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12682.064s">[Knight]</a>: Now you did what you did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12683.204s">[Knight]</a>: It is what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12684.105s">[Knight]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12684.605s">[Knight]</a>: And I know that you haven't been in the chair a long time, so I get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12688.547s">[Knight]</a>: I get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12689.128s">[Knight]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12689.728s">[Knight]</a>: But ultimately, right, we're a body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12692.31s">[Knight]</a>: We're a body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12694.351s">[Knight]</a>: We're a body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12695.111s">[Knight]</a>: Now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12703.631s">[Knight]</a>: We're a body, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12704.732s">[Knight]</a>: So right now what I'm seeing happened is we have a budget that's before us that wasn't the budget that we got when the press releases went out saying this is the first time you ever got a budget, because it was a fake budget, because the school department never passed their aspect of it before it comes to us, which is the normal practice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12719.584s">[Knight]</a>: All right, now we have an administration horse trading, horse trading outside the public sphere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12727.315s">[Knight]</a>: to ensure passage of a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12729.616s">[Knight]</a>: The same administration that runs on transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12733.598s">[Knight]</a>: That's not transparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12735.579s">[Knight]</a>: I don't care what anybody says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12737.239s">[Knight]</a>: It's a classic divide and conquer strategy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12740.281s">[Knight]</a>: A classic divide and conquer strategy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12743.262s">[Knight]</a>: So the mayor for three years can fail to respond to the body public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12747.724s">[Knight]</a>: Fail to respond to the body public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12750.105s">[Knight]</a>: Then there's closed door deals with select Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12754.397s">[Knight]</a>: And other Councilors that are elected by the people of this community are excluded?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12763.282s">[Knight]</a>: You guys think you know about the open meeting law?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12765.283s">[Knight]</a>: I'm gonna tell you right now, I think you're teetering very close, very close to a violation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12770.326s">[Knight]</a>: Just because you weren't in the same room at the same time doesn't mean there wasn't deliberation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12777.37s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not making that accusation, but what I'm saying is, perception is reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12783.066s">[Knight]</a>: So the perception that I get right now is that the mayor picked up the phone, called a few people into her office, and cut a deal, left the rest of us hanging on the shelf.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12790.089s">[Knight]</a>: So we sat here, and we made votes, and we made speeches, and we made pledges, and we made commitments to the people in this community, to the people in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12800.822s">[Knight]</a>: And sometimes making hard decisions isn't politically expedient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12804.905s">[Knight]</a>: Sometimes making hard decisions isn't politically popular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12808.227s">[Knight]</a>: But people didn't elect us to take the easy road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12811.829s">[Knight]</a>: People didn't elect us to take the easy way out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12815.031s">[Knight]</a>: So we've sat here and we beat our chests about, oh, we're gonna protect everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12819.514s">[Knight]</a>: We're gonna get this, we're gonna get that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12821.074s">[Knight]</a>: We've gotten nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12822.415s">[Knight]</a>: This administration's accomplished nothing other than recycling and regurgitating old plans from previous administrations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12829.394s">[Knight]</a>: And we're sitting here passing it like a rubber stamp, pot and parcel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12834.959s">[Knight]</a>: Because it's not about Medford, it's not about the community, it's about what we can get on the way through the door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12845.368s">[Knight]</a>: It's a disgrace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12847.049s">[Knight]</a>: It's a disgrace and I'm disgusted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12849.171s">[Knight]</a>: For the first time in my life, I'm embarrassed to be from this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12853.254s">[Knight]</a>: I love this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12854.295s">[Knight]</a>: I've loved this city my whole life, and I am embarrassed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12857.738s">[Knight]</a>: When I go to neighboring towns and other communities, and I get people going, what the hell's going on with your city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12861.581s">[Knight]</a>: What's going on with your mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12862.822s">[Knight]</a>: What's going on over there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12864.884s">[Knight]</a>: And we all say the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12865.885s">[Knight]</a>: I know it's a disaster.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12867.446s">[Knight]</a>: It's a disaster.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12867.987s">[Knight]</a>: I hear every single person behind this rail say it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12870.189s">[Knight]</a>: I know it's a nightmare.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12871.41s">[Knight]</a>: I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12871.89s">[Knight]</a>: I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12872.29s">[Knight]</a>: Oh, it's awful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12872.791s">[Knight]</a>: It's only going to get worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12873.972s">[Knight]</a>: Just wait till next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12875.273s">[Knight]</a>: And here we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12876.684s">[Knight]</a>: Give me the rubber stamp.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12878.407s">[Knight]</a>: Let's stamp it now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12879.588s">[Knight]</a>: I got what I needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12880.83s">[Knight]</a>: Someone might've got a job out of the budget in the closed door deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12883.434s">[Knight]</a>: I don't know who got what.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12884.576s">[Knight]</a>: All I know is I got nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12886.661s">[Knight]</a>: All I know is I got nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12888.102s">[Knight]</a>: Not even the courtesy of a telephone call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12890.284s">[Knight]</a>: I got a text message at 418.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12891.746s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not sure what time you guys met with the mayor, but I got a text message at 418 saying if I have any last minute questions on the budget, let me or Nina know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12899.672s">[Knight]</a>: A text.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12900.974s">[Knight]</a>: A text.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12901.954s">[Knight]</a>: A text message at four o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12903.636s">[Knight]</a>: Two hours before a meeting, we were talking about $180 million plus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12908.54s">[Knight]</a>: Enough's enough with this clown show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12910.922s">[Knight]</a>: Madam President, I rest my case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12912.482s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not supporting the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12913.943s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not supporting the budget because I don't feel it's transparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12916.323s">[Knight]</a>: I don't feel as though it's an accurate depiction of the finances in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12919.544s">[Knight]</a>: And I don't feel as though it positions us for a future of growth and for a future of success.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12924.145s">[Knight]</a>: All right, our school department is going to fall apart next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12928.086s">[Knight]</a>: We're going to have to lay off 33 teachers because all of our SM money is gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12930.946s">[Knight]</a>: Nobody cares about that, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12933.067s">[Knight]</a>: You know why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12933.667s">[Knight]</a>: It's going to look good in the press releases this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12935.447s">[Knight]</a>: It's going to look good in the campaign material this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12938.728s">[Knight]</a>: Time in and time out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12941.138s">[Knight]</a>: Time in and time out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12942.278s">[Knight]</a>: What's the number one rule of an elected official?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12944.219s">[Knight]</a>: Once you become an elected official, get reelected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12947.36s">[Knight]</a>: We all know that, right, Madam President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14742.701s">[Knight]</a>: And I want to finish my question, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14744.762s">[Knight]</a>: Ultimately, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14745.863s">[Knight]</a>: We've been asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14747.103s">[Knight]</a>: We've been asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14748.464s">[Knight]</a>: We've been asking for financial documentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14750.745s">[Knight]</a>: for two years and haven't gotten it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14752.086s">[Knight]</a>: And now here we are at the budget and you say no, that's a mistake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14755.027s">[Knight]</a>: Oh, that's a mistake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14755.887s">[Knight]</a>: Maybe if they shared this information with us that we've been asking for, as the conduit of communication per the city ordinance that the chief of staff was as a badge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14765.331s">[Knight]</a>: Maybe if some of this do you have a question for me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14768.093s">[Knight]</a>: Yeah, I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14768.993s">[Knight]</a>: I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14769.613s">[Knight]</a>: How is it that we're planning a budget based upon figures that are mistakes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14776.175s">[Knight]</a>: It's all this is, you know, so, so, so, so, so, so when it comes to clear that sucks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14785.382s">[Knight]</a>: And when it comes time for us to do our research, we know clear that's not good so we asked for the information and we don't get the information, but then we're expected to make an informed decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14792.887s">[Knight]</a>: And then when it comes down to us actually sitting down and having a transparent discussion, the mayor doesn't divide and conquer strategy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14799.432s">[Knight]</a>: You know, so that's where we're at in this whole thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14801.555s">[Knight]</a>: This is a joke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14926.391s">[Knight]</a>: Let's just look at the law department as an example, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14929.851s">[Knight]</a>: Now, we haven't had a city solicitor or an assistant city solicitor for a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14934.312s">[Knight]</a>: Last year, we budgeted what, about $422,000?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14938.902s">[Knight]</a>: We still don't have a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14940.142s">[Knight]</a>: We still don't have an assistant city solicitor, yet the department's budget goes up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14944.503s">[Knight]</a>: How does that happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14945.284s">[Knight]</a>: There's nobody even in the office, but the department's budget is going up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14948.604s">[Knight]</a>: There's no employees there except for Janice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14951.605s">[Knight]</a>: There's one person in the office, but the budget goes up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14954.026s">[Knight]</a>: How is that possible if the positions are vacant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14956.886s">[Knight]</a>: I don't wanna hear we pass the COLA, because the person that comes in should be starting at step one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14960.987s">[Knight]</a>: So I don't wanna hear we pass the COLA, because that's just another way to control a false narrative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14968.769s">[Knight]</a>: Okay, why are we giving the city solicitor a raise when the position is vacant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14971.834s">[Knight]</a>: Why is the budget in this the law office going up when the two positions that have funded through the vacant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14980.146s">[Knight]</a>: Yeah, please don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15111.205s">[Knight]</a>: Okay, and didn't we not have vacancies in the finance director's position during that period of time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15123.955s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15422.428s">[Knight]</a>: Madam President, can you repeat that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15424.769s">[Knight]</a>: Instead of taking votes as a body, we want us to email... No, you said you want us to email them individually instead of taking votes as a body and raising the issue with the body public?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15437.096s">[Knight]</a>: And not discuss them, yeah?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16201.268s">[Knight]</a>: It was never shame on you shame on me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16204.971s">[Knight]</a>: Madam President ultimately right we talked about this is this is a communication issue right more than anything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16210.234s">[Knight]</a>: It's a communication issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16211.135s">[Knight]</a>: Would everybody agree this is a communication issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16213.016s">[Knight]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16213.576s">[Knight]</a>: Everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16213.917s">[Knight]</a>: So who's responsible for communication from the mayor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16217.853s">[Knight]</a>: Anybody, anybody know who's responsible for the communications from the mayor's office?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16220.975s">[Knight]</a>: Who went from the mayor's office?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16222.136s">[Knight]</a>: Anybody?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16223.236s">[Knight]</a>: No, it's not the communications director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16225.378s">[Knight]</a>: It's not the COVID specialist, communication specialist or the other two people they got in that office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16230.361s">[Knight]</a>: According to the city ordinances, there shall be a chief of staff of policy appointed by the mayor whose duty shall include managing communication and information both to and from the office of the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16242.929s">[Knight]</a>: So we talk about some of the problems that we have in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16247.91s">[Knight]</a>: A lot of it lies in the application of the ordinances and the incumbents interpretation thereof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16261.38s">[Knight]</a>: So when I sit here and I look at a lot of the problems that happen in this community, and I think about the things we get we get all upset about KP law, one of the biggest things we get upset about right, let's read the city ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16271.888s">[Knight]</a>: Let's read what the city ordinance says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16274.15s">[Knight]</a>: Okay, about an assistant city solicitor, because the city ordinance says that the mayor may appoint an assistant city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16282.856s">[Knight]</a>: Now, can anybody tell me in last year's budget what the assistant city solicitor was?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16286.559s">[Knight]</a>: I believe it was $422,000 was the legal department's budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16289.761s">[Knight]</a>: And our city ordinance says that the administration can't spend more than has been appropriated for the department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16297.086s">[Knight]</a>: But we have correspondence from this administration saying they spent $450,000 on KP law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16302.452s">[Knight]</a>: which exceeds the 422,000 in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16307.216s">[Knight]</a>: Whether or not that information is presented to us now as accurate is in question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16312.501s">[Knight]</a>: But ultimately there's a significant misapplication of the city ordinances in terms of the way that the city is supposed to run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16320.768s">[Knight]</a>: The first of which being there shall be a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16323.891s">[Knight]</a>: Well, there isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16324.812s">[Knight]</a>: There shall be one, there has to be one, there isn't one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16330.145s">[Knight]</a>: Then there are controls put in place through city ordinance to prevent wild and uncontrolled spending like what's going on with KP law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16337.768s">[Knight]</a>: And we don't abide by that either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16342.63s">[Knight]</a>: But to ensure that we are complying with it, we don't have the financial data before us to allow us to make that determination as to whether or not we're in compliance with our local ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16355.795s">[Knight]</a>: Last time we raised an issue about an ordinance, the mayor said, well, the city council can just change it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16360.563s">[Knight]</a>: Last time we raised an issue about process, the chief of staff said, we'll just do it under suspension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16366.106s">[Knight]</a>: This is the same administration that ran on transparency, the same administration that ran on community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16375.33s">[Knight]</a>: Okay, so when we sit here yelling and screaming at each other, let's understand, we're not the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16385.074s">[Knight]</a>: Us in this circle behind this rail are not the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16389.121s">[Knight]</a>: You know what we are?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16390.161s">[Knight]</a>: We're frustrated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16391.342s">[Knight]</a>: You know why we're frustrated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16392.442s">[Knight]</a>: Because we've been putting a plastic bag and we've been trying to punch our way out for the last two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16399.025s">[Knight]</a>: That's why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16400.466s">[Knight]</a>: So we got Zach and George getting frustrated at each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16403.487s">[Knight]</a>: Why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16403.767s">[Knight]</a>: Because of the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16407.629s">[Knight]</a>: Nicole and I becoming very good friends through this whole entire process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16411.371s">[Knight]</a>: Why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16411.591s">[Knight]</a>: Because of the shared concerns and values that we have with the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16417.056s">[Knight]</a>: Doesn't look that way, but that's really what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16420.3s">[Knight]</a>: That's the fact and the reality behind the situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16423.383s">[Knight]</a>: Now, some of us speak a little bit more passionately than others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16426.406s">[Knight]</a>: Some of us have been around a little bit longer than others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16428.849s">[Knight]</a>: So some of us have a level of frustration that's a lot higher than other people's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16433.714s">[Knight]</a>: Some of us have also had the experience of putting up with what I call a BS meter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16438.499s">[Knight]</a>: We all have a BS meter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16439.66s">[Knight]</a>: We can all smell it from a mile away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16441.242s">[Knight]</a>: Some of us are better at smelling it than others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16443.284s">[Knight]</a>: Some of us allow people to have a little bit more leeway when it comes to wafting their BS around here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16447.888s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not one of those people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16449.29s">[Knight]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16449.69s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not going to sit here and waste my time listening to BS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16452.673s">[Knight]</a>: That's not what I'm here for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16454.034s">[Knight]</a>: I'm here to make good decisions on behalf of the taxpayers in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16457.758s">[Knight]</a>: And I can't do that because this administration is fearless.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16461.889s">[Knight]</a>: So we sit here and we infight and we argue and everything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16464.83s">[Knight]</a>: We all want the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16467.071s">[Knight]</a>: We want the respect that we deserve from this administration so that we can do the job that the people in this community elected us to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16474.014s">[Knight]</a>: And we can't do it based upon the tools, the resources, the processes, and the procedures that this administration has implemented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16481.437s">[Knight]</a>: And week in and week out, we express these frustrations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16483.918s">[Knight]</a>: And week in and week in, we beat our chest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16486.616s">[Knight]</a>: And week in and week out, nothing changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16488.537s">[Knight]</a>: Everything stays the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16490.518s">[Knight]</a>: Everything stays the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16491.479s">[Knight]</a>: And how do you make things stay the same?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16493.22s">[Knight]</a>: By doing things like divide and conquer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16495.421s">[Knight]</a>: By doing things like cutting back on deals and making promises you're not gonna keep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16501.705s">[Knight]</a>: By sending out press releases that control narratives that aren't true, but control the spin because there's no local media in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16509.548s">[Knight]</a>: Those are the realities of the situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16511.989s">[Knight]</a>: That's what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16512.83s">[Knight]</a>: And these are the hurdles that we face as a body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16515.812s">[Knight]</a>: But for people who are watching this or people that are sitting in the audience saying, Jesus, these people are nuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16520.114s">[Knight]</a>: What the hell is going on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16521.575s">[Knight]</a>: We all want the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16523.096s">[Knight]</a>: We're just mad because they're not giving it to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16526.598s">[Knight]</a>: That's what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16528.499s">[Knight]</a>: Everybody on this side of the rail shares the same value.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16533.261s">[Knight]</a>: They wanna make Medford a better place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16536.223s">[Knight]</a>: Everyone on this side of the rail has been asking for the tools to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16540.776s">[Knight]</a>: There's only one common denominator and one common thread.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16547.842s">[Knight]</a>: One hurdle, one reason that we haven't been provided with the tools that we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16554.127s">[Knight]</a>: And it comes from across the hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16556.289s">[Knight]</a>: And let's not forget that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16557.87s">[Knight]</a>: Because at the end of this meeting, we're all gonna leave, we're all gonna be pissed off at each other and everything else for no reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16563.475s">[Knight]</a>: Because this is what the administration wants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16566.157s">[Knight]</a>: This is the method that they created to divide a wedge between us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16571.189s">[Knight]</a>: to make it so that this body can't be effective and that they can continue to move with reckless and abandoned and lack of transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16579.096s">[Knight]</a>: And it hurts the taxpayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16580.257s">[Knight]</a>: It hurts the residents in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16583.961s">[Knight]</a>: It hurts the process and it makes people distrustful of government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16588.965s">[Knight]</a>: When people distrust government, they don't participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16591.848s">[Knight]</a>: And when people don't participate, then government operates in a vacuum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16597.176s">[Knight]</a>: We have an administration that already said they throw a third of the voters off of active roles every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16603.459s">[Knight]</a>: When you're taking off the active roles, you know what you don't get in the mail?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16607.98s">[Knight]</a>: Literature from candidates that are running from office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16611.122s">[Knight]</a>: Wow, imagine that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16612.382s">[Knight]</a>: Now you're misinformed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16614.023s">[Knight]</a>: You're an inactive voter that's misinformed, but you're expected to come out to the polls and vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16619.205s">[Knight]</a>: Let's think about what's going on here, folks, because we're not the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16622.526s">[Knight]</a>: And we sound like we are, and we're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16625.868s">[Knight]</a>: We aren't the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16628.579s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17114.321s">[Knight]</a>: So move on a president provided that I could get a question answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17117.003s">[Knight]</a>: Historically, historically, the administration has presented us with this $500,000 request after the rates have been established after the budget's been passed and it's been used for rate relief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17128.792s">[Knight]</a>: Is that going to be the current philosophy behind the expenditure of this plane that's in this paper this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17157.747s">[Knight]</a>: Yeah, I mean every year we get a bill of paper for $500,000 that asks us to offset the rates to the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17164.252s">[Knight]</a>: to the ratepayers for water and sewer through the retained earnings account is this going to be is that's this is this that same 500,000 or is this a different 500,000 or is this something that we're not going to see this year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17180.924s">[Knight]</a>: So they haven't set the rates yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17184.386s">[Knight]</a>: I get $500,000 in rate relief if they do when they do, but we don't know what the rates are going to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17189.19s">[Knight]</a>: I think the motion itself would make sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17255.138s">[Knight]</a>: Section 22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17259.519s">[Knight]</a>: First time in financial reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17261.46s">[Knight]</a>: Paper can be passed in one evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17326.083s">[Knight]</a>: We're transferring X amount of dollars from surplus to deficit to balance the budget, I'm sure, is what he's going to say, something along those lines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17346.305s">[Knight]</a>: So certain accounts run a deficit and certain accounts have a surplus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17349.367s">[Knight]</a>: And what we're doing is the bottom line remains the same and all we're doing is evening out the accounts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17353.29s">[Knight]</a>: So that makes accounting easy, but at the end of the day, the bottom line hasn't changed, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17504.633s">[Knight]</a>: Madam President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17506.254s">[Knight]</a>: First off, this is a good paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17507.795s">[Knight]</a>: It's a paper that I actually filed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17509.516s">[Knight]</a>: This is a paper that I introduced a number of years ago under the Burke administration, and I'm glad to see that the administration has moved on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17516.7s">[Knight]</a>: I'd like to have a committee of the whole paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17519.081s">[Knight]</a>: I've seen this community do just fine in previous years without a stabilization fund and to think that if we don't establish this this immediate second and appropriate $5 million into it that the city is going to fail, I think is a little bit more of a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17534.93s">[Knight]</a>: a fear-mongering approach than it is actually the reality of the situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17538.652s">[Knight]</a>: So in looking at this, you know, the city's been able to survive for all these years without a stabilization fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17543.975s">[Knight]</a>: I think we should sit down and we should talk about it a little bit more and define parameters around the stabilization fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17548.557s">[Knight]</a>: I know state law dictates a lot of what we can and can't do, but I think it would be nice to codify that and to establish a process and a procedure very much like the better budget plan that's been put out to amend that charter, Madam President, the procedure and a process that makes it transparent and make sure that everybody knows what to understand and how to understand it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17706.407s">[Knight]</a>: Sounds like it's a pretty big deal, Madam President, and it's 5 million bucks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17711.129s">[Knight]</a>: We're not gonna have a meeting on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17713.783s">[Knight]</a>: been recommended by auditors, been recommended by bond council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17716.985s">[Knight]</a>: It's necessary for us to keep our A plus rating and it's a $5 million appropriation and we're not gonna have a meeting on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17752.426s">[Knight]</a>: You're making it sound like they're going to be able to get bond council there at the auditor there and everybody else there in 10 days notice and I don't see that happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17786.655s">[Knight]</a>: Bond Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17792.357s">[Knight]</a>: And ultimately, is there anything that precludes this community from bringing this paper forward between now and March?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17801.897s">[Knight]</a>: while our free cash is being certified, knowing that we have more than $5 million in our free cash already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17808.642s">[Knight]</a>: What precludes us from creating this in 90 days or 60 days, but before March?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17814.086s">[Knight]</a>: I'm just asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17870.111s">[Knight]</a>: It just needs to be recertified, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17888.763s">[Knight]</a>: We just passed like a $200 million budget, didn't we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17904.939s">[Knight]</a>: Yes, which- We can establish a stabilization fund and not fund it, and then wait for the free cash to be certified, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17912.982s">[Knight]</a>: We could go through a legislative process and create actual legislation instead of doing this at the 11th hour and making a $5 million appropriation on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17920.947s">[Knight]</a>: You know, I think we're putting the horse behind the car.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17923.748s">[Knight]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17924.369s">[Knight]</a>: It's like, if we're going to create a process, let's create the process and let's go through the legislative process and create it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17929.492s">[Knight]</a>: Let's not throw $5 million into an account and then say figure the rest of that out later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17939.094s">[Knight]</a>: It's like we're creating it and funding it in the same day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17941.338s">[Knight]</a>: Why don't we create it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17963.04s">[Knight]</a>: Does it take a super majority to create it or a super majority to withdraw from it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17966.201s">[Knight]</a>: Both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17996.159s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not sure what to say beyond that we've been on the floor for that amount of committee papers still in the paper now the paper is disposed of by being voted into committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=646.029s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you very much, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=647.389s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Knox, for bringing this resolution forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=650.154s">[Knight]</a>: I think this is a great proactive approach to improving the quality of life for residents here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=655.677s">[Knight]</a>: I will be voting in favor of this resolution and I might ask that the resolution be amended by way of a B paper, Mr. President, which would ask that the Medford police or the building department report back to this council locations that have been reported to have been graffitied within the last 12 months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=670.025s">[Knight]</a>: I think it's very important that we keep track of this data to determine whether or not there were clusters and trends that are occurring here in the city so that we know where to ramp up enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=677.233s">[Knight]</a>: So I'd like to thank Councilor Marks for taking such a proactive approach to looking at the quality of life in this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=682.416s">[Knight]</a>: And I will be voting in favor of this resolution, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=684.878s">[Knight]</a>: I just ask that it be amended for the Police Department of the powers that be to report back any locations that have been reported within the last calendar year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4365.073s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you very much, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4366.86s">[Knight]</a>: I think it's very important that we recognize the efforts and the leadership that Councilman Marks has put forward on the issue of a dog park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4373.064s">[Knight]</a>: Not only has he brought this issue to the council floor, he's actually put his money where his mouth is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4376.886s">[Knight]</a>: He's gone out, I witnessed him personally collecting signatures from members in this community to seek support for a dog park, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4384.75s">[Knight]</a>: And that's the proactive grassroots type of work that makes the community really come together and it makes matters like this come to fruition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4393.625s">[Knight]</a>: I'd like to congratulate Councilor Marks on the efforts that he's put forward, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4396.886s">[Knight]</a>: Not only does he file the resolutions, but he does the legwork.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5602.964s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you very much, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5608.789s">[Knight]</a>: taken a big interest in recent weeks to the water and sewer billing system and the rates that are in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5613.89s">[Knight]</a>: And in my research, I've been able to determine that in 2006, of the MWRA communities, Medford was the 15th highest consumer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5624.413s">[Knight]</a>: And it's also my understanding that a tiered rate system is put in place to promote conservation of use of water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5631.815s">[Knight]</a>: Previous councils, dating back as far as I've looked to 2007, have consistently voted to establish a tiered rate system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5638.312s">[Knight]</a>: We have paper 07464 to establish a tiered rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5642.034s">[Knight]</a>: Paper 07559 to establish a progressive H2O consumption system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5648.296s">[Knight]</a>: Paper 08591, the city engineer present the tiered system for the council to review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5653.418s">[Knight]</a>: 09535, a report on the tiered rate system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5655.779s">[Knight]</a>: 09706, creation of a tiered system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5657.18s">[Knight]</a>: 09838, an excessive use of water program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5658.82s">[Knight]</a>: 10036, the status of a tiered rate system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5669.347s">[Knight]</a>: 720, report back on the progress of creating a tiered system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5673.769s">[Knight]</a>: Dating back to 12-4-07, the Medford City Council has been on record in supporting looking at water and sewer rates and eyeing a multi-tiered system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5682.772s">[Knight]</a>: As recently as 12-24, Mr. President, there was an article in the Medford transcript saying that the City Council supported the implementation of a tiered system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5689.495s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Mayorka was a champion for such a program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5692.016s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Mayorka was of the theory that if you use more, you pay more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5695.397s">[Knight]</a>: And I certainly agree with that philosophy, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5699.13s">[Knight]</a>: In looking at how the rates are determined, we have a Water and Sewer Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5703.072s">[Knight]</a>: The Water and Sewer Commission meets monthly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5704.994s">[Knight]</a>: Here in my city council packet this week, I received a notice of when this Water and Sewer Commission is going to meet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5710.597s">[Knight]</a>: For the edification of the people at home, I'd like to let them know that on October 15, 2014, in room 201, at 2 o'clock, the Water and Sewer Commission will be meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5718.982s">[Knight]</a>: It's open to the public and all members can attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5721.204s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I certainly share some concerns about the itemization of the bill, and I too have seen irregularities in water bills, my own included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5727.504s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5728.084s">[Knight]</a>: However, I think to say that this is a surprise is a little bit of a misconstrue of what's happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5735.528s">[Knight]</a>: It's not in line with what the history shows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5737.448s">[Knight]</a>: It's not in line with what the history says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5819.174s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you very much, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5820.535s">[Knight]</a>: And I was getting there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5821.776s">[Knight]</a>: I think that, you know, when we get a response from the mayor saying to call a public hearings within the council purview, it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5827.522s">[Knight]</a>: We have subcommittees, we have committees, committees of the whole, which has the power to call a committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5833.168s">[Knight]</a>: We have a committee on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5834.744s">[Knight]</a>: auditing finance, budget, and taxation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5836.444s">[Knight]</a>: We have a subcommittee on intergovernmental affairs, and I think that when we call for a public hearing, we don't need to have the permission of the mayor to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5842.546s">[Knight]</a>: We can use our internal governmental structure that we have here as a council in order to promote these meetings, in order to make these meetings happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5848.968s">[Knight]</a>: So when I looked at it and I saw that it falls within the council purview, and then I read the language in the resolution, I said, well, I think that this refers to the fact that the council does have the power to call this meeting, and we don't need the mayor to give us authority to do such.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5859.67s">[Knight]</a>: And that's where I'm coming from, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5861.131s">[Knight]</a>: I certainly feel as though we need to have a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5863.427s">[Knight]</a>: better line of communication in terms of the way that our water and sewer billing is implemented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5868.888s">[Knight]</a>: And I certainly have concerns, because when we look at 2007, we look at the ideas that came out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5873.569s">[Knight]</a>: And the tiered system was really 0 to 1,000 cubic feet of use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5877.87s">[Knight]</a>: And it's gone down to 800.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5879.391s">[Knight]</a>: So I can understand that there must have been some deliberation and some decision-making process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5883.012s">[Knight]</a>: And I, too, share the concerns as to how do we get to this figure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5885.932s">[Knight]</a>: It's my understanding that, based upon conversations that I've had with members of the Water Sewer Commission, that about two-thirds of the households in the city will fall in the first tier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5894.149s">[Knight]</a>: I haven't seen any hard facts and hard figures on that, but that's what's been represented to me through the conversations that I've had with the Water and Sewer Commission, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5900.893s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, I certainly do not see any reason for us to go to the mayor's office and ask the mayor for permission to hold a hearing on this when we have a perfect structure that's in place that's underutilized right now in order to do such.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5911.159s">[Knight]</a>: So I would move, Mr. President, this be forwarded to one of the appropriate subcommittees that we have here that's in existence already for us to actually take ownership of the issue and get the answers that we need without relying on somebody else giving them to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5921.084s">[Knight]</a>: We can go and extract them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6413.158s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Mack.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6413.598s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you very much, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6415.079s">[Knight]</a>: I echo the sentiments relative to infrastructure that Councilor Marks has raised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6420.515s">[Knight]</a>: Our MWRA assessment is calculated every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6422.897s">[Knight]</a>: It's done so by the MWRA estimating the total amount of revenue that's going to be necessary for them to run their water system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6429.603s">[Knight]</a>: The chart is then calculated at a flat rate times the metered water used in a community, and that's how they come up with their assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6435.368s">[Knight]</a>: However, it's interesting to point out that debt service represents 60% of the FY15 budget at the MWRA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6439.992s">[Knight]</a>: So that means 60%<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6443.826s">[Knight]</a>: of their budget is dedicated just to debt service for infrastructure improvements that they've made to deliver these water to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6449.128s">[Knight]</a>: So I think it's time that we need to take a look internally and say, OK, now it's time for us to make this commitment to our infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6454.589s">[Knight]</a>: Because ultimately, in the long run, it is going to reduce the cost for the individuals in this community to pay water bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6841.74s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I do appreciate where Councilor Pentland is coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6844.501s">[Knight]</a>: However, where we're asking so many questions and we have so many questions, I think it would be better vetted appropriately in the subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6850.604s">[Knight]</a>: I think that we can ask these questions, we can get answers to these questions, then we can convene as a body as a whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6855.612s">[Knight]</a>: and we can make recommendations to the Water and Sewer Commission, instead of asking these questions to the Water and Sewer Commission and not having any opportunity to properly vet it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6863.198s">[Knight]</a>: That's why, Mr. President, I will not be withdrawing my motion to amend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6935.762s">[Knight]</a>: Yes, please, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6942.958s">[Knight]</a>: I'd also like to see the city solicitor present where there are some questions relative to legalities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7078.067s">[Knight]</a>: Um, actually, Mr. President, I think that might make sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7080.728s">[Knight]</a>: If any of us have any questions that we'd like to have answered, that we send those questions to the chairperson of the subcommittee to forward to the water and sewer commission prior to this meeting taking place so that we can get this information to us beforehand and have a productive meeting as Councilor Penter suggested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7094.15s">[Knight]</a>: Valid point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7290.914s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you very much, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7292.375s">[Knight]</a>: And Councilor Caraviello brought this up to my attention, actually, would be also Badger Road in Winthrop, where the Caliaco Construction Company's performing infrastructure improvements to our water and sewer pipes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7302.618s">[Knight]</a>: They're driving over the sidewalk to use that piece of land as a layover land.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7305.939s">[Knight]</a>: And as such, they've caused extensive damage to the curb and siding over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7310.379s">[Knight]</a>: And I believe that's one of the safe routes to schools, Mr. President, so I think that's something that might also need to be looked at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7347.273s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you very much, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7348.814s">[Knight]</a>: Where October is National Disability Awareness Month, I found this resolution to be fitting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7354.131s">[Knight]</a>: We have a number of projects going on, a number of projects that have been completed, whether it's through community development block grant funds or otherwise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7361.572s">[Knight]</a>: We're seeing park improvements and accessibility, sidewalk improvements for accessibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7365.353s">[Knight]</a>: And I'd like the director of disability to have an opportunity to come down here and explain to us exactly what progress they've made over the last year or so in terms of improving accessibility and equal opportunity for the residents here in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7395.348s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you very much, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7396.868s">[Knight]</a>: There are two very proud grandparents in two separate parts of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7400.476s">[Knight]</a>: Many of us know Joan Gatto from the magnificent Muffin and Bagel Shop, and right now I'm sure she's smiling with the birth of her newest grandson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7407.801s">[Knight]</a>: As goes Jean Entapa from over in the hillside area of Medford, an employee at Tufts University, who brings, I believe, her third male grandson into the family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7417.828s">[Knight]</a>: I think she has about six total.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7419.749s">[Knight]</a>: However, Benjamin David Entapa joins his sister Ava and his sister Callie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7425.513s">[Knight]</a>: So we'd like to welcome her to the world and congratulate two proud grandparents, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8147.535s">[Knight]</a>: I think that it's important to point out that all the officers in our department are appropriately trained and the Chief of Police has implemented a number of programs as required by state law and otherwise to ensure the safety of our officers and to ensure the fact that the general public is protected and that, you know, these personnel issues that occur.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8169.196s">[Knight]</a>: in any organization, within any organization, not just within the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8173.658s">[Knight]</a>: So although I appreciate what you're saying, I think that, you know, we're getting a little off base here in terms of, maybe you're losing me here, I'm just trying to figure out what direction you're trying to go in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8182.303s">[Knight]</a>: Maybe if you could, you know, you're talking about staffing levels, you're talking about programming, I'm a little confused as to where you're going here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8187.645s">[Knight]</a>: All of the above.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=22.049s">[Knight]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=35.376s">[Knight]</a>: flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=197.672s">[Knight]</a>: Council bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=229.802s">[Knight]</a>: Where Councilor Falco and Mr. McDougal were very close friends in high school, I'd ask that this matter be tabled for next week with Councilor Oakley participating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=271.462s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=272.903s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=274.463s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Falco is absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=275.544s">[Knight]</a>: Vice President Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=276.464s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=277.244s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Marks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=278.765s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=279.945s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=281.186s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=281.986s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=282.486s">[Knight]</a>: President Caraviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=298.665s">[Knight]</a>: Yes, he is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=325.355s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=325.915s">[Knight]</a>: President Caraviello?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=353.713s">[Knight]</a>: Anybody?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=354.014s">[Knight]</a>: Still waiting for them to reconnect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=355.995s">[Knight]</a>: Here they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1712.371s">[Knight]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1712.691s">[Knight]</a>: It's just to receive and place on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2006.836s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2008.076s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2435.847s">[Knight]</a>: Okay, so you amended by Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2557.096s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2557.896s">[Knight]</a>: Vice President Knight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2558.617s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2560.217s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Marks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2561.358s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2562.258s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Morell?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2563.278s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2564.379s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2565.379s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2565.919s">[Knight]</a>: President Caraviello?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2628.855s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2633.639s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2635.12s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Falco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2636.881s">[Knight]</a>: Vice President Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4697.904s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4699.346s">[Knight]</a>: And thank you for my two colleagues that preceded me on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4704.189s">[Knight]</a>: I'm going to try to keep it short.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4706.091s">[Knight]</a>: But ultimately, Mr. President, bottom line is people should have the right to know what health risks are associated with devices that are being affixed to poles outside the house by government entity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4719.04s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, that just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4720.411s">[Knight]</a>: It's ludicrous to me to think that the federal government would not recognize health risk as a basis for denial of an application.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4727.537s">[Knight]</a>: It's shameful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4729.018s">[Knight]</a>: But Mr. President, I think the understatement of the year was made this evening when Councilor Marks made his opening remarks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4736.684s">[Knight]</a>: The city of Medford was ill-prepared, ill-prepared for the 3/31 meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4744.29s">[Knight]</a>: Going back to April of 2019,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4747.674s">[Knight]</a>: That's when the first 5G site meeting was scheduled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4750.735s">[Knight]</a>: April, 2019, two years ago, and it was canceled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4756.518s">[Knight]</a>: In August of 2019, then Mayor Burke came to us with this small cell ad hoc committee, and the council supported that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4765.061s">[Knight]</a>: In November, residents were notified of a site placement hearing, and that meeting was canceled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4775.965s">[Knight]</a>: In January of 2020,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4778.271s">[Knight]</a>: An info session was held with Verizon and the members of this community here in this room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4782.294s">[Knight]</a>: That was a total and absolute failure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4784.876s">[Knight]</a>: Round tables, no question and answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4787.438s">[Knight]</a>: It was more like a high school science fair than it was any type of symposium for residents to get questions or answers to their concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4795.465s">[Knight]</a>: Which brings us to January of 2020 yet again, when this council passed a resolution unanimously with, I believe, a councilor that was sitting here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4803.591s">[Knight]</a>: No, no, she wasn't sitting here anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4804.812s">[Knight]</a>: Now she was across the hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4807.574s">[Knight]</a>: We passed it unanimously asking the city call for a symposium where residents from this community could come and meet with the ad hoc small cell committee representatives from Verizon and the administration to talk about their concerns in the rollout of this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4822.105s">[Knight]</a>: That never happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4824.427s">[Knight]</a>: The very next week, Councilor Marks put forward a resolution because we haven't seen any movement that the small cell advisory committee implements stricter standards<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4837.634s">[Knight]</a>: on their application process to make it a little bit more difficult to walk into our community and do whatever they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4844.036s">[Knight]</a>: So this is January 2020, February 2020, nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4850.259s">[Knight]</a>: March 2020, there was a 5G site meeting that was scheduled and canceled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4856.121s">[Knight]</a>: April, May, June, July, August, September, radio silence, nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4867.915s">[Knight]</a>: No movement, no activity, nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4870.996s">[Knight]</a>: November of 2020, the city administration calls for an executive session with this council to discuss a potential lawsuit from Verizon to the cities in action on the applications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4882.96s">[Knight]</a>: November of 2020.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4885.6s">[Knight]</a>: December of 2020, nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4888.781s">[Knight]</a>: January of 2021, nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4892.623s">[Knight]</a>: February of 2021, a correspondence from the mayor's chief of staff indicating<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4897.742s">[Knight]</a>: that they're going to move forward with the site hearing for 5G with the Ad Hoc Small Cell Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4904.868s">[Knight]</a>: March of 2021.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4908.591s">[Knight]</a>: Scheduled, canceled, and rescheduled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4911.333s">[Knight]</a>: March 31st, the meeting was held.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4914.296s">[Knight]</a>: We are two years, two years from the initial date that these applications became an issue in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4923.724s">[Knight]</a>: Two for 24 months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4926.089s">[Knight]</a>: And we are no further ahead today than we were on August 28th, 2019.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4933.455s">[Knight]</a>: No further ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4935.636s">[Knight]</a>: I commend my colleague to doing his homework for raising the questions and bringing these issues forward, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4939.6s">[Knight]</a>: They're serious issues, serious issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4942.702s">[Knight]</a>: And to think that one of us behind this rail is gonna take a vote not knowing if one of those devices can cause cancer to just one person in this community is insane, is insane to think that we're gonna take that risk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4954.975s">[Knight]</a>: We're going to take that risk, and it's shameful for the federal government to put us in that position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4959.158s">[Knight]</a>: I'll stay with my colleagues all day on this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4960.939s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not taking a vote that's going to hurt people and put the health at risk if we don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4965.082s">[Knight]</a>: If we don't know, we shouldn't be taking the vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4967.564s">[Knight]</a>: And I stand with my colleagues on this, and I thank you both for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5427.961s">[Knight]</a>: My name is Anthony D'Antonio.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5430.162s">[Knight]</a>: I live at 24 Hicks Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=6697.014s">[Knight]</a>: brutal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=7213.184s">[Knight]</a>: This is to consolidate all the papers and amendments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=7217.245s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=7219.104s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Bears?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=7220.405s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=7249.696s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Falco?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=7250.437s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=7251.357s">[Knight]</a>: Vice President Knight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=7380.54s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Bears?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=7582.129s">[Knight]</a>: It seems like we're talking a little bit more about national politics and state politics than we are about local stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=7668.947s">[Knight]</a>: Having worked in the legislature for a number of years, I've witnessed firsthand the fact that nothing ever comes out the way it goes in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=7889.467s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=7891.367s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8441.769s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I share Councilor Falco's concerns wholeheartedly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8445.069s">[Knight]</a>: As a matter of fact, this is a topic that I've brought up in the past as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8448.59s">[Knight]</a>: And when we look at this month's Warren article, this previous month's Warren articles, we'll see that we've received<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8456.776s">[Knight]</a>: seven bills of $5,000 to the tune of 30K, Mr. President, for what is labeled as, I'm sorry, six, I'm sorry, six, 30K.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8471.4s">[Knight]</a>: Monthly legal retainer, it says, monthly legal retainer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8474.221s">[Knight]</a>: So six months, monthly legal retainer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8476.121s">[Knight]</a>: And this is being paid, Mr. President, out of the professional services legal line item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8481.122s">[Knight]</a>: Now, if we go to the previous year's budget,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8484.557s">[Knight]</a>: We'll see in the previous year's budget, underneath the law department, if we look for professional and technical services, other, that line item was funded at $1,500.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8493.644s">[Knight]</a>: Now my assumption, Mr. President, is that this line item was not approved in the next year's budget at an amount that would be four or 500 times that amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8506.354s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, it appears to me that they're doing some deficit spending and come the end of the year, there are gonna be some<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8512.059s">[Knight]</a>: little fuzzy math transfers that we're gonna be doing over here to figure out how we're gonna pay for this, Mr. President, because quite frankly, I don't see that it's being paid for out of an account that's funded to the level that it's being built.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8523.988s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, I thank my council colleague and I support his resolution and I second it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=9431.512s">[Knight]</a>: We're not going down that road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=9787.022s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=9828.732s">[Knight]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=9829.813s">[Knight]</a>: Tony Pujol, I'm in Tanger Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=9831.835s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you for listening to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=9832.715s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you all for being in this beautiful chambers tonight to hear us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=9837.86s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not going to beat up a dead horse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=10611.184s">[Knight]</a>: That's okay, you've been waiting long enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=10785.83s">[Knight]</a>: I also believe that because it's a 40B project, there's some sort of contingency that would say that all the units that are developed can be considered underneath the safe harbor, as opposed to just the affordable units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11225.508s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11229.291s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11274.096s">[Knight]</a>: He was a dear friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11274.936s">[Knight]</a>: He was very committed to American Legion Post 45 and the fundraising efforts and the volunteer and charity work that they do up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11281.558s">[Knight]</a>: He was a Verizon employee that worked at Verizon for a number of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11284.638s">[Knight]</a>: But most importantly, Mr. President, he was one of those guys that would sweat blue and white.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11302.78s">[Knight]</a>: So Mr. President, I'm asking that my council colleagues join in and expressing their deep and sincere condolences to the family of McDougal, of Alan McDougal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11310.485s">[Knight]</a>: He was someone that certainly made a difference here in this community, certainly someone that touched the lives of many youth in this community, and certainly someone that has a legacy that deserves to be remembered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11320.55s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, I rest my case and ask my council colleagues to support the resolve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11691.508s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Bears?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11698.092s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11815.025s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11866.726s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=12064.754s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=12066.034s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=460.268s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=461.489s">[Knight]</a>: And Max, it was a pleasure meeting you earlier this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=463.85s">[Knight]</a>: I've known your uncle and your dad now for a number of years, and I just want to let you know how proud we are as citizens of the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=471.735s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, think about the accomplishment that you and your teammates were able to achieve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=475.397s">[Knight]</a>: Not only do you represent Medford, Massachusetts, you represent the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and you represent the United States of America, and you came back with a gold medal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=483.682s">[Knight]</a>: And that's something you should really be proud of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=485.183s">[Knight]</a>: And I really want to thank you for all your hard work and dedication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=488.064s">[Knight]</a>: making this possible and bringing home the gold to the old 02155.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=491.545s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you very much for your work on this and congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=494.086s">[Knight]</a>: It's a great accomplishment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=494.927s">[Knight]</a>: You should be very proud of your goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=496.987s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2244.451s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2246.232s">[Knight]</a>: I just want to thank my council colleague, Councilor Marks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2248.133s">[Knight]</a>: I think he gave a very thorough and thoughtful presentation that laid out the issues that are really concerning this community and also presented solutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2255.559s">[Knight]</a>: So I appreciate his passion for the subject of thoughtfulness and the way that he put this together, and I support it wholeheartedly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3833.456s">[Knight]</a>: How are you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3834.577s">[Knight]</a>: Good to see you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3835.838s">[Knight]</a>: I spoke with you the other night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3837.199s">[Knight]</a>: I spoke with your husband as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3839.401s">[Knight]</a>: Relative to the debris that was left on the front lawn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3841.863s">[Knight]</a>: And I left the city engineer's office on Wednesday evening with the assurances that there was going to be someone down there to clean it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3847.608s">[Knight]</a>: It was cleaned up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3848.389s">[Knight]</a>: Excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3849.109s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3849.41s">[Knight]</a>: And it's my understanding that the pole was installed by National Grid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3852.952s">[Knight]</a>: At that point in time, but they're installing it for future work So this the grid actually put the pole in right the work that's gonna happen is gonna be Verizon But I didn't want to follow up with that to make sure that that happened because when I spoke with your husband last They might have came out a little later in the day than earlier than he expected So that was just my concern I just didn't want to come home and have this I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5606.223s">[Knight]</a>: You are?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5606.963s">[Knight]</a>: My dear friend, Mr. President, who would appear before this council as city solicitor, who has gone on to his retirement, would always come before this body and remind us that there is a difference between a public hearing and a public meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5617.949s">[Knight]</a>: And a public hearing would be something that is a creature of statute that is required by law versus a public meeting, which is something that we can call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5624.113s">[Knight]</a>: So I would just like clarification from the council as to whether or not we're looking for a public hearing or a public meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5628.295s">[Knight]</a>: I would assume it's a public meeting because the council doesn't really have a vote over whether or not these things can go into play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5984.538s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I think it's also very important to point out that this is the year 10 of the census.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5991.043s">[Knight]</a>: This is also the census that will have an impact on the redistricting of our state house and congressional seats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6000.23s">[Knight]</a>: So it's very important that we do complete the census and fill it out so that we give an accurate count to the people that are making up the districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6007.696s">[Knight]</a>: Because maybe then we can get a rep that represents all of Medford and not just a portion of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6015.113s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6161.351s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6162.031s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6163.031s">[Knight]</a>: Being someone who's 40 years of age and thinking back and saying that my whole entire life, since I've been on this earth, Carol was working in one way or another for the city of Medford is amazing when I think about that, because I feel old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6177.297s">[Knight]</a>: I can just imagine how she feels after putting four decades in to the City of Medford, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6181.9s">[Knight]</a>: She was a great worker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6182.7s">[Knight]</a>: She was someone who was pleasant to be around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6184.642s">[Knight]</a>: Like Rick said, small in stature, but really someone that you knew had a presence in the office and had a presence in the room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6190.926s">[Knight]</a>: Did a great job down in the clerk's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6192.527s">[Knight]</a>: That was the relationship that I was able to develop with her over the short period of time that I've been working here in City of Medford's government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6198.383s">[Knight]</a>: but she will sadly be missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6200.224s">[Knight]</a>: You have a great team down there, Clerk Herterbeest, and she was a key player.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6205.185s">[Knight]</a>: As we see time pass and we see Dottie leave, now we see Carol leave, and we see the changing face of the clerk's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6212.607s">[Knight]</a>: Ed Finn leave and you come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6214.428s">[Knight]</a>: It's a very interesting time right now, and I just want to have the opportunity to thank Carol for all the work that she did down there and how she helped transform the office into what it is today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6351.616s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6353.397s">[Knight]</a>: This is an item that came up during the last legislative session in the State House and it was defeated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6359.36s">[Knight]</a>: And then this council, if you recall last term, asked the licensing commission to examine a feasibility as to whether or not it would make sense to implement the NIP ban with the issuance of new licenses or the transfer of licenses among our package stores here in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6377.793s">[Knight]</a>: That resolve was filed in direct response to the state legislature not being able to pass the expansion of the bottle bill to NIPS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6384.036s">[Knight]</a>: This piece of legislation was refiled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6385.756s">[Knight]</a>: It's coming up for a hearing right now in the Department of Telecommunications and Energy subcommittee, I do believe, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6391.479s">[Knight]</a>: But the intent of this resolution is to have this council go in support in extending the bottle bill to NIP bottles with the hope that that will result in proper disposal and recycling of these plastic bottles that we can find just about anywhere in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6404.784s">[Knight]</a>: River Cleanup Day, if we go down there, you'll see thousands of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6407.706s">[Knight]</a>: You walk through the parking lot down at Anthony's Liquor Store, you see them all over the place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6411.869s">[Knight]</a>: They're everywhere, Mr. President, and it's become an epidemic in our community, so much so that the council thought about taking action on it, and the state delegations thought about taking action on it, and the state legislatures thought about taking action on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6422.157s">[Knight]</a>: Well, it's time to take action, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6423.859s">[Knight]</a>: So I'm asking that this council request that the city clerk be authorized with the power to draft a letter supporting House Bill 2881 and send that to our state delegation and request that they vote in favor of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6434.4s">[Knight]</a>: and take whatever appropriate steps they can to get favorable recommendations out of subcommittee and make this come to a reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6719.648s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6721.269s">[Knight]</a>: Today, Mrs. Roberti was laid to rest, a longtime resident of Leiden Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6726.032s">[Knight]</a>: Her husband, Nick, is a very close friend of mine, and it's very sad to see her go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6730.174s">[Knight]</a>: I first met her maybe nine or ten years ago at a community event, and her daughter, and she was just a very wonderful person, very nice lady.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6737.659s">[Knight]</a>: Her husband, Nicky, is a great guy as well, and we're really sad to see her go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6741.761s">[Knight]</a>: She was a stalwart in the neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6743.702s">[Knight]</a>: a friendly face that everybody could come up and say hello to and talk to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6746.344s">[Knight]</a>: She was always willing to open her door and her home to any individual in the neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6750.025s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, she will be sadly missed in the South Medford neighborhood of Lydon Avenue, Mr. President, as we all know, especially up that fire in South Medford and that stretch of South Medford that's a very close-knit community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6760.291s">[Knight]</a>: And everybody down there knows each other, walks into each other's house without knocking the door, and so on and so forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6766.394s">[Knight]</a>: And this was no different for Mrs. Roberti.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6768.155s">[Knight]</a>: So she's certainly someone that will be sadly missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6770.316s">[Knight]</a>: She was an asset to this community and we're sad to see her go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6772.877s">[Knight]</a>: I'd like to have my council colleagues join me in offering the deepest condolences to her family on her recent passing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6900.102s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6901.903s">[Knight]</a>: This is an issue that we've discussed as a council and a body for a number of years, and we were moving in the right direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6907.487s">[Knight]</a>: A lot of our meetings were being scheduled after 6 PM in the night for our boards and commissions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6912.011s">[Knight]</a>: And we've been running into some circumstances with certain boards and commissions, a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6916.775s">[Knight]</a>: At a time of the day that's not conducive to doing business with residents of the general public, people that work for a living and have a concern in the neighborhood can't attend a meeting because they have other obligations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6926.626s">[Knight]</a>: So back several years ago, we requested that Mayor Burke make changes to the meeting structure and the boards and commissions were all meeting after 5 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6933.814s">[Knight]</a>: at night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6934.495s">[Knight]</a>: And that was all well and good for a period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6936.658s">[Knight]</a>: And then as time passed, so did the stringency of those requirements, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6942.024s">[Knight]</a>: And certain boards and commissions are now meeting at a time that's not really conducive to conducting business in the government sphere for quality of life issues in the neighborhood, such as the traffic commission, for example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6953.117s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, we had some discussions in our priority meeting about what direction the council should be going in over this next term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6960.943s">[Knight]</a>: And one of the things that came up was the meeting times of boards and commissions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6964.366s">[Knight]</a>: And while the boards and commissions don't fall under council purview and do have some autonomy, they also do fall under the branch of the executive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6973.232s">[Knight]</a>: And the mayor does have the power and authority to issue an executive directive or an executive order that would say that they're not allowed to meet before 6 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6981.298s">[Knight]</a>: Monday through Friday so that people that live in this community, but also work for a living, will have the ability to come to these meetings and participate in their government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6988.442s">[Knight]</a>: So that's the intent behind this proposal, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6991.784s">[Knight]</a>: It's something that Councilor Falco and I spoke about before the meeting this evening, and it's something that I hope my council colleagues will join me in supporting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6998.587s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6999.208s">[Knight]</a>: President Falco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=424.93s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=426.05s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=428.331s">[Knight]</a>: This is a very important paper to the membership of American Legion Post 45.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=432.233s">[Knight]</a>: And in full disclosure, I've been a Sal in the past, a son of the American Legion member there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=437.374s">[Knight]</a>: And what this paper does is it allows them to operate underneath the governor's guidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=441.836s">[Knight]</a>: The post has been shut down now since about St.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=444.637s">[Knight]</a>: Patrick's Day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=445.657s">[Knight]</a>: And they haven't had the ability to generate any income whatsoever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=448.838s">[Knight]</a>: And that coupled with the fact that this veteran's organization does provide great support services for young and old veterans here in the community of Medford and beyond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=457.004s">[Knight]</a>: That coupled with the fact that the American Legion Post 45 and its membership are always the first ones to step up when the city of Medford needs something, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=465.509s">[Knight]</a>: If you look to election day on September 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=468.991s">[Knight]</a>: When the Lawrence Memorial Hospital was unable to host us for our election proceedings, the first people to step up to the plate were Richard Mott and Bobby Miller in American Legion Post 45.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=478.814s">[Knight]</a>: And when we celebrate our Memorial Day ceremonies, Mr. President, and we all go down to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=486.016s">[Knight]</a>: Oak Grove Cemetery and we sit there and we listen to the beautiful presentations put on by our veterans organizations and as we sit there we see those flags all across the cemetery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=495.973s">[Knight]</a>: American Legion Post 45 is the group that coordinates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=499.994s">[Knight]</a>: The placing of those flags on our veterans' grave markers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=502.616s">[Knight]</a>: So it's very important, Mr. President, that we recognize the work and the partnership that the American Legion has provided the citizens and the residents in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=509.821s">[Knight]</a>: And I think it's very important for us to adopt and embrace this opportunity for them to get a common victuals license so that they have the opportunity to reopen and generate some revenues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=518.887s">[Knight]</a>: And also allow the membership, the opportunity to come back in and to continue their mutual support relationship that they have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=526.011s">[Knight]</a>: When we look at the agenda later on this evening, we have a paper talking about substance abuse and addiction recovery services and the ability to have meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=534.154s">[Knight]</a>: And veterans organizations, although they don't necessarily hold meetings per se, are a great spot for veterans to congregate, to get together, and to talk about their shared mutual experiences and how to go through some of the struggles that they're having.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=545.438s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, this is a paper that I support wholeheartedly, and I'd ask my council colleagues to also join me in supporting it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=778.813s">[Knight]</a>: Okay, why don't we try that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=965.97s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, at the end of our packet, there's a letter by Mr. Paris, and I think it's a very good explanation of what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=973.2s">[Knight]</a>: Dear members of the city council, regarding our sign request for Liv's Juice and a Kai bar located at 56 Stations Landing, my understanding is that we're allowed two feet of projection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=982.512s">[Knight]</a>: Since our 24 inch sign is circular, the total square foot is just 3.16 square feet, as opposed to the total four square foot sign that's allowed by the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=991.155s">[Knight]</a>: The mounting of the sign is flush to the building and would look very funny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=993.776s">[Knight]</a>: And as a result, we're asking for four additional inches of projection for the standoffs to make it fit within the neighborhood and uphold the great look there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1001.358s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I personally find a circular sign more aesthetically pleasing than a big square or rectangular sign sticking off the side of a building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1007.541s">[Knight]</a>: I think Mr. Paris has given us a great explanation, and although it doesn't present a significant hardship, it certainly does present some curb appeal issues that this council has discussed in the past, and I support this paper wholeheartedly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1148.67s">[Knight]</a>: I know our ordinance speaks to the signs not being illuminated after 10 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1152.833s">[Knight]</a>: Anyhow, what are the hours of the gentleman's operations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1196.908s">[Knight]</a>: But whatever the practices at stations landing, I mean, I'm not opposed to the measure at all, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1267.862s">[Knight]</a>: I thank Councilor Marks for raising the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1437.066s">[Knight]</a>: Yes, Mr. President, again, at the end of this application, there's also a letter dated March 3rd, 2020 from Mr. DeSilva at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1443.868s">[Knight]</a>: I guess March 3rd is when he requested his appeal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1447.188s">[Knight]</a>: And it reads, the purpose of these proposed awnings is to provide protection from the environment, enhance the appeal of the car wash, and instruct customers of free vacuum services in an attractive way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1457.031s">[Knight]</a>: Despite the weather conditions, customers will be comfortable vacuuming their vehicles under the shade and shelter of the awning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1462.032s">[Knight]</a>: And the awnings are not only to benefit the customer's comfort, but also create a more attractive facade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1466.294s">[Knight]</a>: Finally, the awnings instruct the customers where the free vacuums are located and create a clear space to park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1472.516s">[Knight]</a>: So Mr. President, it seems like they're seeking 13 awnings, one over each vacuum that look like to be canvas awnings that aren't internally illuminated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1484.3s">[Knight]</a>: But I do believe that they would have certain public safety benefit instructing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1492.033s">[Knight]</a>: where the free vacuums are in a location like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1494.814s">[Knight]</a>: I believe this is the old Randy's Car Wash on Middlesex Ave, if I'm not mistaken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1499.216s">[Knight]</a>: They've always done a pretty good job over there at Randy's, and I don't think that the new operator would be any less successful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1506.879s">[Knight]</a>: And I can certainly support a reversal on the sign denial, but is 13 really the number that we want to approve, I guess is the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1703.756s">[Knight]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1704.516s">[Knight]</a>: I would second that motion, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1707.839s">[Knight]</a>: For it's often in the form of a I guess it would be a restriction correct counsel, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2260.718s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2263.259s">[Knight]</a>: It says that these signs would be internally illuminated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2265.5s">[Knight]</a>: Does any of these internally illuminated signs face a residential structure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2275.444s">[Knight]</a>: Right, because you got the old margaritas on one side, the other hotel, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2281.467s">[Knight]</a>: So they're not facing any of the, because they're pretty big, 150 foot square feet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2286.089s">[Knight]</a>: All right, sounds good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2286.949s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2458.434s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, in the past, if I may.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2467.039s">[Knight]</a>: In the past, Mr. President, when a circumstance like this has arose, what we've done is put a 30, 60, or 90 day review on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2474.444s">[Knight]</a>: I don't know if that's something we wanna do in this situation or circumstances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2478.206s">[Knight]</a>: I haven't gotten any complaints<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2481.328s">[Knight]</a>: from anybody regarding the sign at 75 stations landing to date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2486.051s">[Knight]</a>: So I don't find it to be a big issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2488.432s">[Knight]</a>: However, if it does become an issue because of the action of this council, I think that we should absolutely have the ability to give it a review to make sure that we're not disrupting anybody's quality of life that resides in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2499.298s">[Knight]</a>: Well, at the same time, still supporting the application of the Fairfield Marriott Hotels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2504.703s">[Knight]</a>: We all understand the benefits that having an additional hotel in our community is going to bring to us financially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2509.348s">[Knight]</a>: And historically, they've been a good partner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2512.03s">[Knight]</a>: Our other two hotels have been great partners here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2515.234s">[Knight]</a>: So I don't want to, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2520.163s">[Knight]</a>: I don't want to claim nefarious intent, but at the same time, I think it's important that we protect the residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2524.505s">[Knight]</a>: So I would offer a 30 and 60 day review on the paper and move for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2529.688s">[Knight]</a>: For the sign only facing 75 stations only.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2538.372s">[Knight]</a>: I'm sorry, I don't know if 75 is the address, but the north facing sign abutting the residential property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2570.035s">[Knight]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2570.355s">[Knight]</a>: I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2825.465s">[Knight]</a>: So Mr. President, just to be clear, this application before us is just for the permit to reverse the sign denial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2832.808s">[Knight]</a>: And any type of relief sought by the applicant relative to hours of operation outside of the ordinance and its 7 AM to 10 PM requirements would have to be sought under a different cover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2844.131s">[Knight]</a>: That's not going to be covered under the aspect of the vote that we're taking this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3304.425s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, through you, I was wondering if the petitioner could tell me on what side of the retaining wall on Broadway is this trench going to be dug?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3312.549s">[Knight]</a>: Is it going to be on the northern side of the retaining wall or on the southern side?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3316.731s">[Knight]</a>: If you're familiar with the area and you're driving up from Winter Hill and Somerville along Broadway, you'll come to the intersection of Medford Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3326.036s">[Knight]</a>: There at that intersection, by way of history, is Paul Revere Park, which is the smallest park in the United States of America.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3332.08s">[Knight]</a>: But I digress, Mr. President, as you go past Paul Revere Park, Broadway splits in two, and you can go up Broadway and travel along the Medford border.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3341.005s">[Knight]</a>: Some of that is Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3342.706s">[Knight]</a>: Or you can stay on Broadway proper and go straight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3346.687s">[Knight]</a>: So I was wondering exactly where this trench was going to be dug, because there is a Broadway in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3352.029s">[Knight]</a>: And it's the roadway that runs parallel to Broadway in Somerville, right where that split is, where it goes up and over the ridge and comes back down and brings you out where the old Salvation Army used to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3364.413s">[Knight]</a>: right at Winter Hill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3365.313s">[Knight]</a>: So I was wondering if the applicant could tell us where the trench is actually going to be dug.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3369.015s">[Knight]</a>: Is it going to be dug on Broadway proper or is it going to be dug on that one-way access road?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3397.361s">[Knight]</a>: So do we know which side of that retaining wall it's going to be on, I guess, is the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3407.946s">[Knight]</a>: Nor do I. So if you're looking at Medford Street at the intersection, you see that little park?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3416.39s">[Knight]</a>: Right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3416.67s">[Knight]</a>: If you go past the little park,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3419.462s">[Knight]</a>: There's a line with a little square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3422.764s">[Knight]</a>: And that line with a little square, I think that's a street that comes right through there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3429.168s">[Knight]</a>: So I just don't know what side of the wall that proposed gas main is going to be on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3434.531s">[Knight]</a>: Is it going to be on Broadway proper, or is it going to be on the access road?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3443.776s">[Knight]</a>: I would much rather prefer it to be on Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3448.114s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not in Medford, personally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3471.44s">[Knight]</a>: My colleagues are following me with what I'm talking about, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3473.4s">[Knight]</a>: You guys know what I'm saying?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3483.527s">[Knight]</a>: Dexter Street is Big Bundle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3524.707s">[Knight]</a>: I'm sorry, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3526.868s">[Knight]</a>: That's Main Street, the little park, not Medford Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3534.032s">[Knight]</a>: Main Street and Medford Street split.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3535.894s">[Knight]</a>: Main Street goes further to the, I guess it would be east, and Medford Street goes up past those parks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3543.418s">[Knight]</a>: So I was confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3544.178s">[Knight]</a>: I had, because Dexter Street threw me off, because Dexter's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3547.639s">[Knight]</a>: Dexter runs through Maine to Medford, so this is further down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3552.103s">[Knight]</a>: Creative Science is on the corner here of Dexter and- You are correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3557.188s">[Knight]</a>: So this will be going, there is no retaining wall, so this is all going in front of- Trump Field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3561.992s">[Knight]</a>: The pizza place, Dacos Tavern, the Chinese food restaurant coming around the corner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3566.716s">[Knight]</a>: Okay, yep, I second the motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3610.125s">[Knight]</a>: This is a service call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3611.628s">[Knight]</a>: I know that there's some discussion in here about an SOP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3614.413s">[Knight]</a>: So SOP means that the applicant<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3618.973s">[Knight]</a>: would provide the city with the funds to then go and perform, no, that's a street opening permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3624.797s">[Knight]</a>: That's a different program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3625.797s">[Knight]</a>: I guess the question is, is the 60 feet of roadway that's being torn up in Medford going to be replaced curb to curb?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3632.161s">[Knight]</a>: Where this is creation of new service, we're tearing up a couple of roadways 60 feet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3636.864s">[Knight]</a>: Are we going to be able to get curb to curb restoration?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3691.704s">[Knight]</a>: Yes, I see it there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3692.445s">[Knight]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3694.066s">[Knight]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4616.403s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4618.043s">[Knight]</a>: From my brief calculations, it looks like this application seeks for about a half a mile of a ground opening permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4627.385s">[Knight]</a>: Does that sound correct, sir?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4632.47s">[Knight]</a>: That sounds about right, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4634.452s">[Knight]</a>: 2600 feet or something like that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4636.094s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4636.795s">[Knight]</a>: And it goes right through our central business district, Mr. President, one that we've been talking about for as long as I can remember in terms of what we're going to do to revitalize it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4647.225s">[Knight]</a>: The lack of commitment to revitalize Medford Square coupled with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4651.994s">[Knight]</a>: the impacts of the Kranich Bridge closure for such an extended period of time, along with the COVID-19 situation that's happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4664.725s">[Knight]</a>: We have a number of restaurants and places that provide food services along this stretch, and the impact that they've<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4675.561s">[Knight]</a>: The financial impact that they've had to put up with through a variety of different reasons over the course of the last five years is troublesome, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4684.204s">[Knight]</a>: So I guess this is a long way of asking a question, and the question is, how long will this construction take?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4714.151s">[Knight]</a>: Okay, so you think you guys can do 100 feet a day?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4718.294s">[Knight]</a>: More than 100 feet a day?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4721.016s">[Knight]</a>: Easily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4721.396s">[Knight]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4722.156s">[Knight]</a>: What are the plans in terms of the storage of equipment and materials during the construction period?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4750.079s">[Knight]</a>: Is everybody at home getting this in case they have a problem during the construction?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4782.354s">[Knight]</a>: Will the public way be used for the overnight storage of equipment and materials?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4787.755s">[Knight]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4788.775s">[Knight]</a>: Can we put that as a condition?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4795.597s">[Knight]</a>: Okay, excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4796.517s">[Knight]</a>: So I'd like to offer that in the form of an amendment number 18, Mr. President, as a condition that there'll be no storage of any equipment or materials on the public way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4802.939s">[Knight]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4804.04s">[Knight]</a>: With that being said, I rest my case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4805.18s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5426.459s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I personally couldn't agree with Councilor Bears more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5428.842s">[Knight]</a>: I'm very glad to see the property owner and the historic commission sitting down trying to make compromise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5434.449s">[Knight]</a>: We have ample opportunity and time to still address this matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5439.416s">[Knight]</a>: We have another meeting before the deadline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5442.598s">[Knight]</a>: I'd ask that the matter be tabled to a date certain to allow the homeowner and the historical commission to continue their deliberations and discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5449.343s">[Knight]</a>: But with that being said, Mr. President, we do have, I believe, representatives here from the owner that have been working on a plan or are ready to make some commitments to a plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5459.59s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd ask that the property owner be given an opportunity to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5754.423s">[Knight]</a>: I got a question if you're ready to give it to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5756.084s">[Knight]</a>: I have no problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6190.453s">[Knight]</a>: I'm sorry, provided it passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6195.435s">[Knight]</a>: But if, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6268.208s">[Knight]</a>: Is the city solicitor available as requested by the president from the meeting yesterday?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6282.394s">[Knight]</a>: I'm just looking at the committee report from last night where President Falco said that the council needs the city solicitor present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6288.797s">[Knight]</a>: And then the next sentence says Mr. Howard suggested holding off on a historic district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6292.987s">[Knight]</a>: So that's what I'm referring to is the conversation we had last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6309.597s">[Knight]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6310.518s">[Knight]</a>: But with all due respect, Mr. President, I had a conversation with the solicitor as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6314.64s">[Knight]</a>: And from what the solicitor told me in my conversation with her was that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6319.673s">[Knight]</a>: The issuance of the demolition permit is told when the paper is advertised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6328.256s">[Knight]</a>: So it doesn't matter if 18 months pass after the paper is advertised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6332.898s">[Knight]</a>: And there's case law on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6334.578s">[Knight]</a>: And she and I spoke about it at length today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6337.099s">[Knight]</a>: I did too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6338.52s">[Knight]</a>: So I'm not sure if the information that you're getting from her and the information that I'm getting from her are the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6344.122s">[Knight]</a>: But I'm pretty confident in the conversation that I had with her where she said, you're absolutely right, Adam.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6348.423s">[Knight]</a>: I don't know why this is so hard to understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6351.348s">[Knight]</a>: First reading happens, then it gets advertised, and then advertisement controls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6355.175s">[Knight]</a>: If advertisement goes out, the demolition permit can't get issued, regardless of whether or not October 8th comes and goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6362.603s">[Knight]</a>: So second reading is the advertisement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6366.705s">[Knight]</a>: And that is what tolls the demolition delay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6369.307s">[Knight]</a>: And we can toll the demolition delay on October 7th if need be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6372.728s">[Knight]</a>: So I don't understand the need to take this to a vote right now when you yourself had suggested that the city solicitor needs to be present in order for us to make this vote properly, number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6381.373s">[Knight]</a>: And number two, when the representative of the historic commission who was with us at the meeting suggested we hold off on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6400.811s">[Knight]</a>: The Herald runs every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6402.192s">[Knight]</a>: The Globe costs $1,500.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6403.973s">[Knight]</a>: Pay it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6405.174s">[Knight]</a>: The House is so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6406.074s">[Knight]</a>: Why don't we want to spend the money to advertise for it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6408.595s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, more people read the Globe than the transcript.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6410.276s">[Knight]</a>: I can't tell you a person that ever bought the Medford transcript in the last 15 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6413.018s">[Knight]</a>: I don't know one person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6414.118s">[Knight]</a>: I buy it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6414.639s">[Knight]</a>: I get it every week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6416.159s">[Knight]</a>: God bless you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6417.906s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6452.129s">[Knight]</a>: Between 7 o'clock last night and this morning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6576.648s">[Knight]</a>: I'm glad Ryan gave you approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6675.261s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, before we table the matter, there is a committee of the whole report that's before us that's going to have to get put into the agenda for next week's meeting for us to vote on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6684.628s">[Knight]</a>: But last night at the site visit, we did vote on a motion to ask a question of the city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6692.316s">[Knight]</a>: And that question that we asked to the city solicitor was, can this process constitute a regulatory taking, opening up the city to financial or other liabilities?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6701.062s">[Knight]</a>: And I'd like to offer that question to the city solicitor as a B paper this evening, so that we can get that to her for an answer as well before next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6728.158s">[Knight]</a>: Opening the city up to financial or other liabilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6804.671s">[Knight]</a>: October 6th, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6810.552s">[Knight]</a>: Sounds right to me, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6845.749s">[Knight]</a>: Motion to revert back to regular order of business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6878.642s">[Knight]</a>: Should I be asked to withdraw my motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6880.202s">[Knight]</a>: I'd be happy to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6881.603s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6885.883s">[Knight]</a>: Certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7087.71s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, if the legislation doesn't pass by the close of the end of the legislative session, then the bill needs to be reintroduced for the next legislative session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7095.636s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7097.377s">[Knight]</a>: The question would come as to whether or not we need to pass another home rule petition to reintroduce the bill in the next legislative session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7102.902s">[Knight]</a>: And that I can't answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7116.317s">[Knight]</a>: Is that a question you'd like to ask the solicitor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7138.832s">[Knight]</a>: I, for one, will not be supporting this paper this evening, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7141.333s">[Knight]</a>: We're in the middle of a global pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7143.153s">[Knight]</a>: We had a meeting for two hours today talking about how we're unable to conduct regular city council business right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7149.635s">[Knight]</a>: One out of five adults in Massachusetts are unemployed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7152.196s">[Knight]</a>: We have a 20% unemployment rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7153.816s">[Knight]</a>: We're seeing the worst economic time since the Great Depression.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7158.137s">[Knight]</a>: People are restricted in their ability to get about the community, to speak with people, to talk to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7162.098s">[Knight]</a>: It's going to impact the ability to run a grassroots campaign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7164.819s">[Knight]</a>: and inform the residents in this community what's going on, number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7168.281s">[Knight]</a>: Number two, in times of uncertainty, we need stability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7172.663s">[Knight]</a>: In times of uncertainty, we need stability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7174.524s">[Knight]</a>: We should be focusing on getting our kids back to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7176.425s">[Knight]</a>: We should be focusing on getting our economy locally back up and running.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7179.346s">[Knight]</a>: I think that's what our priority should be right now during this global pandemic, things that actually make the community and the city run, the services that we deliver.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7186.73s">[Knight]</a>: You know, I've stated and I've been opposed to this process in the past, doing it with the homework petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7190.792s">[Knight]</a>: I feel as though this is something that should come from the voters, that should come from the ground up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7194.113s">[Knight]</a>: And now is not the time to promote a ground up effort when the activities of people are so hamstrung.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7200.559s">[Knight]</a>: And where our government is operating under such stringent restrictions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7204.783s">[Knight]</a>: So for those reasons, I'll be voting against the paper this evening, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7207.405s">[Knight]</a>: I rest my case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8148.165s">[Knight]</a>: I do think it's also important to point out, for those that are so supportive of the measure, that if it goes forward tonight, you get two bites at the apple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8156.531s">[Knight]</a>: because if it doesn't pass by January, then it gets refiled again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8159.654s">[Knight]</a>: And if it does get passed before January, then you get charter commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8163.516s">[Knight]</a>: But I don't support the paper, but from an operational standpoint, if it got held until the end of the year or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8171.983s">[Knight]</a>: or tabled or whatever it may be, and it can't come back up for 90 days, so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8176.047s">[Knight]</a>: The next session's in session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8177.349s">[Knight]</a>: So you can send the paper to legislation now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8179.411s">[Knight]</a>: If it doesn't get taken up for a vote, it doesn't get taken up for a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8181.713s">[Knight]</a>: Then you want to do it again in January anyway when the circumstances change, you get another bite at the apple with a new legislature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8187.599s">[Knight]</a>: So that's something to think about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8188.76s">[Knight]</a>: But either way, I'm not going to support it this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9208.967s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I'm glad that we're finally getting to the finish line on this proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9213.05s">[Knight]</a>: It's been long overdue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9214.35s">[Knight]</a>: I can remember filing the initial resolution asking Mayor Burke's staff to craft an ordinance some three and a half years ago, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9222.495s">[Knight]</a>: And in looking at the final product that we have here before us, I think it looks great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9226.037s">[Knight]</a>: I do have concern, and one of the concerns, the only concern I have about it is the enforceability of the seven barrels and the ambiguity of the seven barrels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9239.448s">[Knight]</a>: In the Seawind District, breweries operating with seven barrels or under would be allowed by right, and breweries operating with more than seven barrels would be allowable by special permit of the Board of Appeals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9247.628s">[Knight]</a>: Well, who's the barrel police and what's the parameter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9252.632s">[Knight]</a>: Is it seven barrels a day, seven barrels a week, seven barrels a month, seven barrels a year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9256.595s">[Knight]</a>: I guess is my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9257.876s">[Knight]</a>: It's not going to prevent me from voting on the ordinance this evening, Mr. President, but I certainly think it's food for thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9263.141s">[Knight]</a>: I don't think that we're going to have somebody out there that's going to be the barrel police that's measuring liquid to see who serves seven barrels versus seven and a quarter or seven and a half or eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9271.808s">[Knight]</a>: And I just don't see how that aspect of the ordinance is enforceable and what precludes somebody from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9277.492s">[Knight]</a>: applying for a special permit by right at seven barrels, but then going over the seven barrel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9286.109s">[Knight]</a>: limit how are we going to know, how are we going to enforce, what's the parameters and standards that are going to be put in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9291.813s">[Knight]</a>: That's the only issue that I have, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9293.875s">[Knight]</a>: But this is taking too long for us to come to this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9297.478s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, if it does pose a problem, we can always take it up at a later date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9301.861s">[Knight]</a>: But I do think that that's a deficiency in our ordinance here this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9446.676s">[Knight]</a>: I certainly can appreciate the gentleman seeing through the trees to see the forest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9452.818s">[Knight]</a>: It was about taxation and how we were going to recuperate money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9455.78s">[Knight]</a>: And I'm confident that we'll be all right moving forward with the languages here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9461.102s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, but it was more about how we're going to be able to monitor it because it's a revenue generating issue as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9466.364s">[Knight]</a>: So his astute business mind picked up on that relatively quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9552.176s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9614.577s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, a motion to sever the CAC ordinance from the zoning ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9674.147s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9678.123s">[Knight]</a>: In review of the selection committee ordinance, I see that our esteemed counsel from KP Law has failed to include the local 3% tax option language that was requested of him on multiple occasions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9695.367s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd make a motion to amend the CAC ordinance to have the city solicitor, not KP Law, as previously asked multiple times, but our city solicitor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9707.54s">[Knight]</a>: to draft language to include the local 3% tax option to generate revenues for the city as an impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9718.768s">[Knight]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9741.763s">[Knight]</a>: As previously directed to KP law on multiple occasions and it never got in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9745.265s">[Knight]</a>: Yes, that's correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10004.459s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, can I be so bold as to offer a motion to waive the reading of the paper?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10264.273s">[Knight]</a>: Ultimately, Mr. President, just a brief synopsis on this paper authorizes marijuana dispensaries to be located in industrial and commercial two districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10272.985s">[Knight]</a>: It adopts the state statutory buffer zones and has a number of requirements and restrictions in place relative to border health, fire, police, security, safety, and the like, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10283.79s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, I think we've all talked this thing to death at this point, and I'd move for approval of the paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10288.972s">[Knight]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10406.458s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10407.959s">[Knight]</a>: Here we are, what, ten months into the year, and we have a number of ordinances that we've requested drafts of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10414.562s">[Knight]</a>: We've gotten some back, we haven't gotten others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10418.224s">[Knight]</a>: With the craziness that's going around with how government operates these days, with City Hall being half open and half closed, with the council being half open and half closed, I thought this would be a good opportunity for us to keep some of the items that this council's concerned about on the forefront, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10432.371s">[Knight]</a>: I know in the past, we've had situations where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10435.572s">[Knight]</a>: Papers get filed and then they kick around for quite a bit of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10439.054s">[Knight]</a>: For example, the marijuana ordinance that we just talked about that took five years to come to fruition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10444.158s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, this is an effort as the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. President, to get our work product out and get it out in an expedient fashion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10451.062s">[Knight]</a>: I think ten months to wait is plenty of time for us to request an update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10455.145s">[Knight]</a>: And if we can sit down with the city solicitor and go over where we are and the progress that we've made on some of these items, I think we'll be able to put out even a better work product.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10465.251s">[Knight]</a>: This council's shown that it's been able to put out ordinances and has quite a vision for what the legislative body should be doing and for what legislative process should look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10476.024s">[Knight]</a>: And I just want to make sure, Mr. President, as the chairman of the subcommittee, that we're living up to the expectations of the residents here in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10481.95s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to support this measure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10485.092s">[Knight]</a>: It would be three meetings, October, November, December, and the second Tuesday of each of those months for us to get a better handle on where we're at in the draft ordinance process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10495.038s">[Knight]</a>: I've had the opportunity to speak with Solicitor Scanlon, and she's started to do legwork for some of this stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10500.261s">[Knight]</a>: It's no reflection on the work of her office or that of the clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10503.643s">[Knight]</a>: What it is, it's a reflection on this body and our willingness and desire to put out a favorable work product to the residents in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10510.667s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, I ask my council colleagues to support the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10611.016s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Layton.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10611.696s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10613.096s">[Knight]</a>: Since the C-Click Fix program has been implemented, I have offered this resolution annually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10617.958s">[Knight]</a>: I feel as though it's very important that the council be provided with a breakdown of what types of requests are being made by our citizenry and whether or not they're being brought to a resolve that meets their satisfaction and expectation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10629.94s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'm requesting this data because data drive decision making.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10634.501s">[Knight]</a>: And when we can take a look at these C-Click fix requests, we might also be able to identify where our deficiencies lie in the deliverance of services here in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10645.413s">[Knight]</a>: And then when the budget process rolls around, we have a better idea as to where we need to invest our funds to be sure that the taxpayers are receiving the level of services that they're so duly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10657.084s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, I ask that my council colleagues support the measure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10660.645s">[Knight]</a>: What it is, is it's a tool for us to gather data to be more informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10663.886s">[Knight]</a>: So when the budget process starts, we can have the opportunity to reallocate funds to those areas where we feel as though we can do better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10748.151s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, on that, I remember sitting back and we were talking about C-Click fix.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10753.933s">[Knight]</a>: And I believe it was a request that was made on DCR-owned property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10761.054s">[Knight]</a>: been two previous administrations ago, maybe a previous administration ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10763.996s">[Knight]</a>: And the discussion was issue resolved, and the response was, that's state property, call the DCR.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10771.079s">[Knight]</a>: And that's the issue isn't resolved, the buck was passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10773.461s">[Knight]</a>: And I remember Councilman Marks bringing that up, because he got a call from a resident that wasn't too satisfied with the answer that they got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10779.203s">[Knight]</a>: And it was mocked as resolved, but it really wasn't resolved, it was closed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10782.605s">[Knight]</a>: So I certainly share your position on this, Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10788.276s">[Knight]</a>: And I'll be happy to amend the paper any which way that meets that objective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11087.876s">[Knight]</a>: I don't, I thank Councilor Marks for bringing up the point there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11168.356s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11170.017s">[Knight]</a>: The condition that our public utility providers and others that are offered street opening permits leave our streets in is something that's been a topic of conversation before this board for a number of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11182.705s">[Knight]</a>: Earlier this evening, for example, we had several grants of location and some of the things that we talked about were curb to curb.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11189.005s">[Knight]</a>: Paving, how long the project's going to take, where the project's going to be located.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11193.43s">[Knight]</a>: But I think, Mr. President, a lot of these times when we issue a street opening permit, and maybe it's not for a half a mile of roadway like we issued earlier today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11202.28s">[Knight]</a>: Maybe it's only for 50 linear feet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11205.063s">[Knight]</a>: It gets forgotten about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11206.565s">[Knight]</a>: And that final restoration never happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11208.967s">[Knight]</a>: And we've seen places all over the community where we see trenches and patches and road work that's just fallen apart that our public utilities have performed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11218.292s">[Knight]</a>: We've done a great job holding them accountable when they're coming before us for grants of location and things that are in our scope and our authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11224.056s">[Knight]</a>: But I think we can step it up a notch, Mr. President, and begin to look at the street opening permits when they're issued and what the follow-up protocols are to be sure that the taxpayers in the community and the residents in the community<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11236.309s">[Knight]</a>: are afforded the opportunity to have their streets restored to the same condition that they were in prior to these construction and ground opening permits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11242.891s">[Knight]</a>: When these ground opening permits are issued, it's usually for the purpose of underground utility work and underground utility upgrades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11249.093s">[Knight]</a>: And these underground utility upgrades allow the city to generate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11254.176s">[Knight]</a>: the ability to assess a personal property tax on the underground infrastructure that's being placed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11259.382s">[Knight]</a>: But this underground infrastructure that's being placed along with the personal property tax that the city can get also provides the utility provider with the ability to have more efficient operations and in turn increase their profits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11272.837s">[Knight]</a>: So when we talk a lot about what's going on in the community and community benefits, we look at public utility providers that are very protected and very insulated through state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11281.907s">[Knight]</a>: That aren't leaving our streets and our roadways in a condition that a lot of us feel would be suitable and satisfactory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11287.353s">[Knight]</a>: And this is an effort to make sure that this stays in the forefront, Mr. President, with the monthly report letting us know what roadways have been ripped up, when the construction took place, when the construction was completed, and what the plans are in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11299.901s">[Knight]</a>: After six months, when they're going to get out there and get it done if they have to go there and do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11303.523s">[Knight]</a>: It also allows us the opportunity to monitor the list and make sure that after the six months is up that these roadways get restored.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11309.306s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, I ask my council colleagues to support the paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11505.666s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11507.186s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11509.967s">[Knight]</a>: I've gotten a number of calls surrounding accounting, billing, and collections practices in the Treasurer-Collector's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11518.289s">[Knight]</a>: When we sit there and we look at what's going on, we have no assistant Treasurer-Collector.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11522.07s">[Knight]</a>: We have a temporary Treasurer-Collector, a part-time Treasurer-Collector that's a retiree that's been brought back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11527.667s">[Knight]</a>: So in the interest of financial transparency, Mr. President, and to address some of the concerns that have been raised by those in the community, I'd request that an audit be conducted for the first 10 months of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11539.119s">[Knight]</a>: When we look at where we were this time a year ago, we had very, very, very aggressive collections under the previous administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11548.683s">[Knight]</a>: A lot of money came in through the collections process, Mr. President, and I just want to make sure that we're doing the best that we can to ensure that these dollars are being captured and spent wisely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11714.545s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I'd be happy to amend the paper to get three years of the last three years of the audits in that department to take a look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11721.15s">[Knight]</a>: And then if there's any concern, I can pursue this paper at a future time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11725.393s">[Knight]</a>: I'd ask the Councilor if that would satisfy his question and maybe allow him the opportunity to support this paper with that amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11736.782s">[Knight]</a>: So often as a motion to amend Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11748.408s">[Knight]</a>: Last three years of the auditor's reports to the Treasurer-Collector's Office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11846.574s">[Knight]</a>: I don't want this to turn into a referendum on the qualifications or the abilities of Mr. Pompeo, but Mr. Pompeo is also limited to the number of hours that he can work as a retiree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11856.647s">[Knight]</a>: So as a retiree in the public pension system, he's limited to 960 hours a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11864.286s">[Knight]</a>: If there's no assistant, then he's limited to 960 hours a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11867.448s">[Knight]</a>: That's why I raised the concern, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11869.75s">[Knight]</a>: But it's not a reflection of the duties or the work that he does down there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11872.652s">[Knight]</a>: It's a reflection of the staffing levels down there and the level of productivity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11877.656s">[Knight]</a>: But with that being said, I've amended the paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11879.497s">[Knight]</a>: I just don't want this to be turned into a referendum on Mr. Pompeo because that wasn't my intention in any way, shape, or form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11954.961s">[Knight]</a>: Big picture of Mr. President would be the way that I'd like to look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11957.742s">[Knight]</a>: Three years, 12 months in a packet, you know what I mean, is the way that I'd prefer it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11965.605s">[Knight]</a>: Then we can take a look at those monthlies afterwards and see, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12120.013s">[Knight]</a>: I'd be happy to support that amendment, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12311.858s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12313.119s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Caraviello, thank you as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12314.76s">[Knight]</a>: And Richie, thank you for everything that you do to the City of Medford, for the City of Medford, in the City of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12320.983s">[Knight]</a>: Richard has been a great business owner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12323.084s">[Knight]</a>: He's the type of business that we want to have here in the City of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12326.445s">[Knight]</a>: When the pandemic hit, you saw what he did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12329.247s">[Knight]</a>: He put out jersey barriers, he put out a tent, he has live entertainment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12332.728s">[Knight]</a>: He's trying to keep<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12334.994s">[Knight]</a>: the sense of community going here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12336.975s">[Knight]</a>: He does a great job, as Councilor Caraviello said, the countless, countless, countless deliveries of food to people's homes when their loved ones pass away, unsolicited, unwanted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12349.904s">[Knight]</a>: In some instances, Mr. President, Richie goes above and beyond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12352.946s">[Knight]</a>: And not just in terms of being a business owner, but in terms of being a community partner and someone that really loves the city of Medford, cares for the city of Medford, and wants to make it a better place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12362.933s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12364.394s">[Knight]</a>: through you to Richie and to his staff, Peter and Jason and everybody else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12369.775s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you very much for all you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12551.229s">[Knight]</a>: Again, I defer to the senior member, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12593.245s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12594.726s">[Knight]</a>: Yeah, as Councilor Caraviello mentioned, Teresa was the wife of former city manager John Glioni.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12604.109s">[Knight]</a>: And when John was here running the city, Teresa was running the show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12609.731s">[Knight]</a>: As they always say, behind every good man is a better woman, and this is no different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12614.793s">[Knight]</a>: What a great family the Glioni's raised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12617.735s">[Knight]</a>: My dear friend, Janine McGonigal, Teresa was her mother.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12621.844s">[Knight]</a>: And she will be sadly missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12623.705s">[Knight]</a>: I'd just like to offer my condolences to the family and ask that my council colleagues join Councilor Caraviello and I in doing the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12897.543s">[Knight]</a>: Relatively self-explanatory, Mr. President, in the September 8th packet, we did receive a draft ordinance that we requested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12903.005s">[Knight]</a>: I believe it was at the direction of Councilor Caraviello, and based off a previous paper that was issued in the previous session, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12909.907s">[Knight]</a>: But with that being said, the solicitor's office has put out a work product for us to review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12913.829s">[Knight]</a>: And I'd ask that a COW be scheduled so that we can have the opportunity to do such.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13032.159s">[Knight]</a>: Yes, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13034.892s">[Knight]</a>: The Knight Early Education Academy over on Woburn Street has been up and running now for almost a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13043.179s">[Knight]</a>: And it's a trying experience, to say the least.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13048.224s">[Knight]</a>: But with that being said, Mr. President,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13051.4s">[Knight]</a>: One thing I'm noticing is that there's a need for us to be sure that those that don't have the same opportunities as others are still being provided the access to a quality public education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13065.197s">[Knight]</a>: And truancy is one of those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13067.86s">[Knight]</a>: one of those situations that's something that needs to be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13071.042s">[Knight]</a>: And our surrounding communities, some of them have multiple full-time truancy offices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13075.724s">[Knight]</a>: I believe at one point the city of Somerville had three full-time truancy offices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13080.867s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not saying or alluding to the fact that truancy is a problem in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13085.529s">[Knight]</a>: But what I am saying is that based upon the new times that are before us and the expectations that have been expressed through our school committee and through that of DESE.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13096.896s">[Knight]</a>: the direction of the superintendent, ultimately our goal is to get kids back in school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13101.643s">[Knight]</a>: But until then, we're going to be relying on remote learning or hybrid learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13106.53s">[Knight]</a>: And my<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13108.703s">[Knight]</a>: concern is that certain subsects of our population are going to slip through the cracks and not be provided with the same opportunities that others are being provided during this time, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13118.49s">[Knight]</a>: So as the parent of a first grader and understanding that during these formidable years, the importance that education plays in the long-term development of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13128.917s">[Knight]</a>: an academic student raises concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13132.338s">[Knight]</a>: So I'd ask that the school committee just provide us with a report as to what their plans are and how to address truancy during the pandemic and during the hybrid learning, during from home learning, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13144.3s">[Knight]</a>: I think it's very important that we understand what's going on so that we can ensure that all the students across the board are being provided with an ample opportunity to be educated properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13155.991s">[Knight]</a>: I'd like to further amend the paper to Mr. President and request a report from the school department indicating how many students we've lost to private schools between last year and this year due to the school closures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13167.383s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to support the paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13207.22s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, although the committee does not report to the council in terms of policy, the buck does stop here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13212.963s">[Knight]</a>: The buck stops here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13214.844s">[Knight]</a>: So if we're seeing a problem with truancy and we have one part-time truancy officer here in the community, maybe the council says it's time to kick it up a notch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13221.827s">[Knight]</a>: Maybe you gotta hire a couple more people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13224.288s">[Knight]</a>: And if you don't, then maybe we're going to have to hold back some funding over here until you do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13228.71s">[Knight]</a>: So there's an opportunity in a way for us, Mr. President, very similar to the way that we were able to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13233.072s">[Knight]</a>: broker a deal with the historical commission and the property owner to promote and push for certain aspects of a better quality public education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13243.677s">[Knight]</a>: And where the council controls the purse strings, and truancy is a concern, and there's a school department policy and a city policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13251.761s">[Knight]</a>: I do believe that surrounds some of this stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13253.582s">[Knight]</a>: I think it's important that we know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13255.662s">[Knight]</a>: I guess my question is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13256.983s">[Knight]</a>: Why don't we want to know what their policy is on truancy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13260.264s">[Knight]</a>: And why wouldn't we expect them to have one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13262.965s">[Knight]</a>: It's not so much that we want to force something down their throat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13266.687s">[Knight]</a>: All we're doing is asking them to report back to the council with a report on what its plans are to address truancy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13274.069s">[Knight]</a>: It's not a request to tell them to make a plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13276.17s">[Knight]</a>: It's not a request to tell them how to do it, where to do it, or when to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13279.151s">[Knight]</a>: It's a request to fill us in and give us information as to what you're doing to make sure that this situation doesn't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13285.636s">[Knight]</a>: I can certainly appreciate the council's position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13288.678s">[Knight]</a>: However, knowledge is power and the more knowledge we have, the better off we're going to be and the better job we're going to be able to do for the people and especially the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13296.543s">[Knight]</a>: As a parent, Mr. President, this is very concerning to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13300.046s">[Knight]</a>: Two young children at home, a six year old and a four year old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13303.428s">[Knight]</a>: The day before school was supposed to start, my four year old lost his daycare.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13308.131s">[Knight]</a>: So people are struggling through this, and the more information that we have, the better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13312.476s">[Knight]</a>: And the other thing that's important, Mr. President, is if we do see a truancy problem, usually the truancy problem isn't necessarily rooted in anything other than things going on at home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13323.628s">[Knight]</a>: And while the school committee does have certain authority, the city has far more resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13329.474s">[Knight]</a>: when it comes down to family issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13332.116s">[Knight]</a>: So that's another opportunity, Mr. President, for us to gain some more information and then maybe modify or amend the types of services that we deliver to the residents here based upon the data that we're receiving to see what makes sense to be sure that the taxpayers are getting the level of services that they so deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14056.123s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I do remember, maybe, was it five weeks ago?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14061.846s">[Knight]</a>: You sent an email out to the administration talking about $250,000 that was part of our agreement with cable, our cable agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14075.223s">[Knight]</a>: And I don't believe we ever got a response as to whether or not those funds were going to be appropriated or how they were going to be utilized, did we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14084.502s">[Knight]</a>: It was a form letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14086.663s">[Knight]</a>: Similar to a form letter, if I'm not mistaken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14093.987s">[Knight]</a>: May I be so bold to suggest, Mr. President, that a portion of the $250,000 from the cable agreement be allotted for the purpose of hiring an election coordinator for the November general election?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14109.294s">[Knight]</a>: And can I be so bold as to suggest that in the form of a amendment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14113.036s">[Knight]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14116.178s">[Knight]</a>: I don't want to steal your thunder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14117.058s">[Knight]</a>: You're the guy that found the money, John, but let's spend it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15364.962s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15368.404s">[Knight]</a>: The idea was raised as part of a committee report during our budget discussions, something I brought up when we were looking at the projections during the COVID-19 circumstance and the budget deliberations relative to the anticipated forecasted revenues that were going to be coming in through the various departments that are revenue generating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15391.927s">[Knight]</a>: the building department and their building permits, for example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15395.608s">[Knight]</a>: And when we sat down with the finance director and we saw what the trends were and what the projections were, we took a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15404.011s">[Knight]</a>: And that vote was to have quarterly meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15407.532s">[Knight]</a>: with the finance director to update us on where we are currently in terms of collections and where our projections are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15415.659s">[Knight]</a>: And this is a follow-up to that recommendation that was made during the budget hearings back in June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15421.424s">[Knight]</a>: I'd ask my council colleagues to support it as the first quarter was July, August, and September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15427.149s">[Knight]</a>: And September is going to be closing at the end of the week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15429.411s">[Knight]</a>: Our next meeting is October.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15432.934s">[Knight]</a>: Sixth is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15433.715s">[Knight]</a>: You are correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15434.375s">[Knight]</a>: And the meeting after that I'd ask that the finance director be prepared to appear before the council at a council meeting and give us an update as to where we are on forecast and projected revenues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15602.914s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I thank the councilors for bringing this resolution forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15607.174s">[Knight]</a>: I'd also, I think it's very important that we recognize the work of our Substance Abuse and Prevention Office and where they've come in such a short time since being created.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15618.397s">[Knight]</a>: The office has only been in effect now for maybe what, five years, six years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15622.998s">[Knight]</a>: And the strides that they've made in this community in terms of education and outreach have been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15629.099s">[Knight]</a>: enumerable compared to where we were before to where we are today, the level of services that we offer as a city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15637.341s">[Knight]</a>: But I think it's also important, Mr. President, to recognize that in the spirit of National Recovery Month, that this is a resolution that we must support this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15646.804s">[Knight]</a>: And I wholeheartedly will vote entirely in favor of it this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15856.844s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15945.382s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16158.022s">[Knight]</a>: Motion to table the committee reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16193.851s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, on the records of August 25th, I'd like to move for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16197.092s">[Knight]</a>: If we table these, any further 30 days will pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16199.492s">[Knight]</a>: The open meeting law says that it's best practice to have them approved within 30 days of passage, of completion of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16205.574s">[Knight]</a>: So I'd move for approval of the August 25th- Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16208.014s">[Knight]</a>: You have 15 minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=425.099s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, motion to revert back to the regular order of business to take care of paper 20-476.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=458.476s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=462.377s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=479.751s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, motion to table the next regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=481.892s">[Knight]</a>: City solicitor was requested to put some language together last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=484.993s">[Knight]</a>: She's not in receipt of that quite yet, so she needs another week to put that together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=489.415s">[Knight]</a>: I'd move for approval to a date certain next regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=492.136s">[Knight]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3051.274s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, if I may?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3054.867s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I just want to take an opportunity to thank Sue and her team from Melrose Wakefield Hospital, the Newton name that they're going by now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3063.43s">[Knight]</a>: But they've done a great job in responding to the council's inquiries, the council's concerns, and always being ready and available to come here to address this body when we have issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3072.874s">[Knight]</a>: So I do want to thank them and commend them for the work that they've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3075.795s">[Knight]</a>: And I look forward to working through some of the design issues that we have and the construction issues that we're having in the neighborhood between now and our next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3982.136s">[Knight]</a>: You read the update, didn't you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=4097.627s">[Knight]</a>: Do these phase three, part two updates that you just gave us relative to capacity extend to the Medford City Council Chambers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=4118.379s">[Knight]</a>: So there's no limit on the capacity of people, it's just we're exempt from that, you said?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=4131.243s">[Knight]</a>: Okay, so we could have more than 125 people in the council chambers provided that we could maintain safe space?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=4139.586s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6017.408s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6018.949s">[Knight]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6019.129s">[Knight]</a>: O'Connor, based upon the statements that you've made tonight, what is the position of the administration on sending our children back to school, number one, and what role has your office played in determining safe air quality standards in our public school buildings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6091.111s">[Knight]</a>: They're well aware of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6092.312s">[Knight]</a>: Are you aware if the school department is using the recommendations of any medical professional in terms of their moving forward with the air quality examinations and the determination of safe standards?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6124.958s">[Knight]</a>: And what is the position of the administration relative to returning our students back to school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6163.056s">[Knight]</a>: In your professional opinion, do you feel as though the school will be held in an in-person fashion at all this year, or do you think it will be hybrid and remote?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6186.997s">[Knight]</a>: You obviously don't have a child at home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6196.945s">[Knight]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6197.205s">[Knight]</a>: So as of right now, we really don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6206.616s">[Knight]</a>: And Mr. President, I'd like to also offer a C paper because Councilor Caraviello beat me to the punch on the B paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6212.357s">[Knight]</a>: But this C paper would be an ordinance, Mr. President, an emergency ordinance that would say that any school department or city employee who is required to quarantine due to occupational exposure to COVID-19 be placed on paid administrative leave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6226.587s">[Knight]</a>: as opposed to having to use their sick time or their vacation time or their recruiting time, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6231.989s">[Knight]</a>: It's an occupational exposure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6233.39s">[Knight]</a>: It's something that's happened because they're trying to perform the duties of their job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6237.032s">[Knight]</a>: And if that case happens, I don't think it's fair that these individuals should be punished by having to use their sick or vacation time in order to quarantine during these periods of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6244.955s">[Knight]</a>: So I'd ask that that C paper be forwarded to the city solicitor for her to draft up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6275.06s">[Knight]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6276.421s">[Knight]</a>: Any school department or city employee required to quarantine due to occupational exposure to COVID-19?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6281.743s">[Knight]</a>: Okay, hang on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6362.073s">[Knight]</a>: Seems like it's a public policy initiative that's generally accepted by the administration, Mr. President, so I see no harm in memorializing that by way of an emergency ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6396.806s">[Knight]</a>: Just administrative leave doesn't have to be rather than anything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6398.866s">[Knight]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6405.512s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I'd like that to go to the city solicit of a legal review and drafting, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6441.115s">[Knight]</a>: That does it for me, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7668.461s">[Knight]</a>: The thing that's taking place- The information that the speaker is requesting is not under our scope and purview, so we don't have the ability to provide that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7680.233s">[Knight]</a>: The information that the speaker is requesting is not under the scope and purview of the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7684.556s">[Knight]</a>: That information is under the scope and purview of the school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7687.958s">[Knight]</a>: And I know that the teachers union has a lot of concerns and a lot of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7693.602s">[Knight]</a>: And maybe it would be more appropriate for the union to meet with the director of health in a side meeting on this, because I think- So Adam, I hear what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7712.054s">[Knight]</a>: Councilman, are you all done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7713.135s">[Knight]</a>: That was it, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7713.955s">[Knight]</a>: I just thought we were kind of going off a little away from a council meeting and a little bit more into negotiation at that point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7737.264s">[Knight]</a>: Motion to receive and place on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7738.784s">[Knight]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7741.265s">[Knight]</a>: Actually, Mr. President, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7743.086s">[Knight]</a>: Motion to report the questions out, receive the paper, and place on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7745.727s">[Knight]</a>: Still second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8122.367s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8122.928s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, can I ask the petitioner, the council that made the motion to explain the reasoning for the reason to sever?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8148.251s">[Knight]</a>: I'm looking at Chapter 48, Section 51 right now, and it looks to read the same to me under Amendment 1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8165.296s">[Knight]</a>: We want to table the issue so the gentleman can take a look at the legislation, Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8168.817s">[Knight]</a>: The current zoning ordinance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8173.758s">[Knight]</a>: Is that necessary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8174.539s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, you made the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8176.563s">[Knight]</a>: I'm comfortable with the motion as is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8281.158s">[Knight]</a>: It looks to me, Mr. President, like actually- It looks to me like it actually takes away the mapping requirements as outlined in the establishment of the district under 4851A.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8289.165s">[Knight]</a>: This is only an amendment to- Bounded as respectively shown on the map entitled versus under the authority of 40C, the following districts bounded respectively in which are on file in the city clerk's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8307.512s">[Knight]</a>: and made part of this article reference to hereby established.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8310.095s">[Knight]</a>: It takes away the mapped district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8317.802s">[Knight]</a>: It takes out the word map entitled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8321.145s">[Knight]</a>: I'd be happy to re-insert them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8323.767s">[Knight]</a>: So you want to re-insert the same language that's in the existing ordinance to separate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8328.132s">[Knight]</a>: I don't have a problem with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8330.354s">[Knight]</a>: So we're going to strike<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8332.338s">[Knight]</a>: Amendment 1 and replace it with the existing language in 48-51a.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8337.541s">[Knight]</a>: Is that the motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8346.966s">[Knight]</a>: And the map entitled the hillside historic Avenue district and the mom Simmons historic district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8437.717s">[Knight]</a>: It's because I didn't understand it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8438.838s">[Knight]</a>: I didn't understand why we needed the motion to sever the two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8442.122s">[Knight]</a>: However, Mr. President, I'll rest my case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8443.724s">[Knight]</a>: I'll just vote no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8451.494s">[Knight]</a>: I don't think he's the city solicitor, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8765.346s">[Knight]</a>: Can I just ask them to repeat that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8767.368s">[Knight]</a>: They want what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8767.829s">[Knight]</a>: Over the building?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9111.615s">[Knight]</a>: Is it the role of the Historic Commission or the Historic District Commission to establish historic districts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9120.304s">[Knight]</a>: So why would Mr. Haywood be the expert on these questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9303.491s">[Knight]</a>: Is the gentleman a structural engineer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9314.842s">[Knight]</a>: And the architects have the...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9317.83s">[Knight]</a>: professional knowledge and expertise to determine whether or not a structure is salvageable based on the building code and the like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9524.142s">[Knight]</a>: So, Mr. President, so- Counts on eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9527.903s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. Haywood was present at the walkthrough as the chairman of the Medford Historic Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9534.605s">[Knight]</a>: The issue that was before us was whether or not October or something was going to come and go and a demolition permit was going to be issued.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9542.844s">[Knight]</a>: From what I understand, based upon the history that we've all discussed ad nauseum at this point concerning this project, was that he applied for a demolition permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9555.029s">[Knight]</a>: He got his property deemed preferentially preserved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9560.13s">[Knight]</a>: He had his engineer come and say the place can't be salvaged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9565.693s">[Knight]</a>: Where in the process does this design review come into play for the historic commission?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9572.671s">[Knight]</a>: And if the gentleman said, hey, look it, my engineers say the place can't be salvaged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9579.436s">[Knight]</a>: Why did the historic commission wait 17 months to send this to historic district commission?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9585.76s">[Knight]</a>: And then Mr. Haywood from the historic commission is the one that made a representation that I believe if we look at the committee report that this shouldn't be deemed a historic district and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9600.176s">[Knight]</a>: the compromise would be satisfactory and that would be the direction that they would move it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9605.522s">[Knight]</a>: Now, last night, they go before the historic district commission to have the plans looked at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9611.168s">[Knight]</a>: I'm totally confused by this process, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9613.23s">[Knight]</a>: It's an absolute mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9614.691s">[Knight]</a>: It's an absolute mess, in my opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9617.995s">[Knight]</a>: So I'm a little confused as to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9622.591s">[Knight]</a>: The historic district commission doesn't have any design review authority until it becomes a historic district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9627.675s">[Knight]</a>: And by statute, the historic commission has no design review authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9632.678s">[Knight]</a>: And we discussed that at the committee of the whole and the chairman of the committee, the commission acknowledged that they don't have design review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9640.003s">[Knight]</a>: They're not enabled, those powers on the ordinance that they're operating under.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9645.748s">[Knight]</a>: So I'm very confused as to how this is working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9648.451s">[Knight]</a>: It seems to me like it's somewhat being weaponized against the developer or against the builder because he didn't agree that the building could be saved and present plans for them to look at during a 17 month period where there's no real statutory authority for them to have design review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9733.908s">[Knight]</a>: The part that's confusing me is why is it before your board if it's not a historic district commission yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9739.091s">[Knight]</a>: Why is it at the Medford Historic District Commission?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9740.973s">[Knight]</a>: Why is he going to a meeting there presenting plans when it's not a historic district commission?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9745.115s">[Knight]</a>: And the negotiations took place between the historic commission, not the historic district commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9805.907s">[Knight]</a>: Is the administration going to offer that paper to the council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9808.389s">[Knight]</a>: Because the paper that's before us is the paper that the mayor gave us on September 3rd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9820.529s">[Knight]</a>: Paper 20541 is the paper before us offered by Mayor Lungo-Curran to the Medford City Council September 3rd, 2020.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9829.277s">[Knight]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9829.978s">[Knight]</a>: 33 days ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9956.626s">[Knight]</a>: So I'm confused by this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9957.827s">[Knight]</a>: So the historic commission sent their paperwork to the historic district commission to establish a single home historic district at 16 Foster court and August 28th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9973.799s">[Knight]</a>: The historic district commission took a vote at that August 28th meeting that passed three to zero to move forward with the creation of the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9985.077s">[Knight]</a>: Correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10012.235s">[Knight]</a>: Okay, so then the mayor sends to us this language on September 3rd?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10016.938s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10022.142s">[Knight]</a>: You guys only passed it August 28th, that's pretty good if you ask me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10025.925s">[Knight]</a>: You guys passed it August 28th, the mayor sent it to us September 3rd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10028.527s">[Knight]</a>: I don't think that's too bad, five days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10034.818s">[Knight]</a>: Now, the language that the mayor sent us is the language that you guys never looked at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10038.541s">[Knight]</a>: Is that what I'm understanding?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10039.982s">[Knight]</a>: So you voted for the principle, but you didn't vote for the language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10083.505s">[Knight]</a>: As to what it is that you seek?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10084.946s">[Knight]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10086.581s">[Knight]</a>: But until this 16 foster court is deemed a local historic single home district, what authority does the Medford Historical District Commission have over it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10122.675s">[Knight]</a>: In theory, then, Mr. Goldschneider had no obligation whatsoever to appear before the Historic District Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10133.984s">[Knight]</a>: Where he really should have been would be before the Medford Historic Commission, because that's where the rub lies, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10140.409s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, that's what it sounds to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10168.892s">[Knight]</a>: So, I mean, absent... So for 17 months, the applicant<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10178.371s">[Knight]</a>: sat saying, you know, my engineers say it's a total teardown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10182.575s">[Knight]</a>: My structural engineer says that, you know, there's nothing I can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10185.918s">[Knight]</a>: I have to rip it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10186.899s">[Knight]</a>: I have to pull it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10188.14s">[Knight]</a>: My structural engineer, my expert, who I hired and has paid the money, told me that this is what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10193.905s">[Knight]</a>: So he has an expert opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10196.827s">[Knight]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10197.808s">[Knight]</a>: So at that point in time, when<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10201.673s">[Knight]</a>: he notified the historic commission of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10205.234s">[Knight]</a>: Don't you think it would have made sense that maybe then you moved it forward to the historic district commission instead of dragging it out for 17 months?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10226.699s">[Knight]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10226.939s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, I feel like it's being weaponized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10228.459s">[Knight]</a>: Do what we say or else we're going to cost you a ton of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10265.286s">[Knight]</a>: Sorry to hear that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10266.307s">[Knight]</a>: Can you just tell me what the terms of service are for all the members?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10271.748s">[Knight]</a>: No, in terms of how long they've served.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10273.508s">[Knight]</a>: I'm you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10273.888s">[Knight]</a>: I know that your term is three years, but you've probably been on there for 12.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10279.509s">[Knight]</a>: So how many years have you served on the commission?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10283.655s">[Knight]</a>: 18.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10283.675s">[Knight]</a>: All right, how many years has the next most senior member served?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10296.162s">[Knight]</a>: You're 11?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10310.114s">[Knight]</a>: because that raises some concern, too, when the representative from the historic commission says, well, no one has been paying attention to this for 20 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10318.777s">[Knight]</a>: And then we look at the terms of service of the members that are on the board, and we look at the council resolution from 2014, which asked that single home historic districts be sought after and be proactively identified prior to the request for a demolition permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10335.644s">[Knight]</a>: And that was something that...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10345.775s">[Knight]</a>: It happened at the budget when you were there asking for money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10369.451s">[Knight]</a>: So we were given the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10370.972s">[Knight]</a>: So that was six years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10372.292s">[Knight]</a>: Can you tell me how many single home historic districts you've identified in the past six years, absent the demolition permit or a request from the MCD?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10403.487s">[Knight]</a>: So in 6 years there's been one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10407.87s">[Knight]</a>: Well, this wasn't proactively identified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10409.712s">[Knight]</a>: This was as a result of a demolition permit being pulled and then well, that was this was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10421.822s">[Knight]</a>: By what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10436.757s">[Knight]</a>: I know it's hard to sell a building if nobody knows about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10439.319s">[Knight]</a>: All right, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10452.746s">[Knight]</a>: They own it, aren't they allowed to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10484.542s">[Knight]</a>: I think that's something we'd all appreciate, Mr. President, through you to Mr. Bader.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10490.287s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I do have a last question, and I'll rest my case at this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10493.91s">[Knight]</a>: At the council meeting when this issue was brought up and at the subsequent subcommittee meeting, I did ask a question to the city solicitor as to whether or not the criteria<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10507.081s">[Knight]</a>: the circumstances of this particular property could constitute a regulatory taking, opening up the city of Medford to financial or other liabilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10516.394s">[Knight]</a>: And I'm wondering if you've received a response, or the city clerk maybe has received a response relative to that question of law that we asked the city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10554.764s">[Knight]</a>: The consensus by the four members of the Historical District Commission, the consensus of a land court judge, the consensus of whom?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10565.306s">[Knight]</a>: You said it was the consensus that this is not a regulatory taking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10582.941s">[Knight]</a>: So the district commission conducted a three-prong test to determine whether or not it was a taking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10606.408s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10606.868s">[Knight]</a>: So I think that opinion might be important, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10608.969s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10711.984s">[Knight]</a>: I think I believe that the last meeting I asked for a copy of the letters that was sent to Mr. Goldschneider, inviting him to these 17 consecutive meetings that had him on the agenda that said we're asking you to come and present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10723.189s">[Knight]</a>: Because the way that I see their agenda is that everything that they have going on, they just throw on the agenda and put it out every week and whatever comes up, comes up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10729.812s">[Knight]</a>: So although it might have been on the agenda for 17 months, I don't believe that the gentleman was invited to appear to any of these meetings over that period of time but for one or two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10750.511s">[Knight]</a>: Can the gentleman please provide me with the information that he just received and what expert provided it to him?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10754.233s">[Knight]</a>: A multi-million dollar contract, a multi-million dollar project, a multi-million dollar property?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10758.116s">[Knight]</a>: I think that that's not what I said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10938.463s">[Knight]</a>: Could the clerk provide a record of such communication?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10942.044s">[Knight]</a>: Adopted by the city council in the form of minutes and forwarded to the proper authorities, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10947.896s">[Knight]</a>: Did it happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10949.357s">[Knight]</a>: That's obviously not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11579.619s">[Knight]</a>: Point of information, Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11581.56s">[Knight]</a>: That sounds an awful lot like deliberation to me, Mr. President, absent a public meeting notice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11587.322s">[Knight]</a>: And I think that that's something that we better be very careful of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11592.204s">[Knight]</a>: Individual members of a board of commission passing private notes to the chairman of the commission to be passed on to another board of commission that reflects their opinion, that's done behind closed doors, not in the open sunset of day, I think is a problem, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11606.59s">[Knight]</a>: And I think that that might rise to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11610.848s">[Knight]</a>: the level of violation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11614.03s">[Knight]</a>: And as public employees, we need to be very careful in that regard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11634.08s">[Knight]</a>: Did anybody from the Historical Commission appear before the Historic District Commission and give an opinion as to what they felt?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11643.652s">[Knight]</a>: Was that opinion reflective of the board or the individual?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11660.578s">[Knight]</a>: A member, a chair, same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11663.239s">[Knight]</a>: There's deliberation that's going on behind closed doors, Mr. President, that's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12685.261s">[Knight]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12685.441s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, with all due respect to the councilor, the gentleman's going to have to seek legal advice if he's willing to make that type of commitment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12691.365s">[Knight]</a>: All right, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12725.801s">[Knight]</a>: I did, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12726.701s">[Knight]</a>: Is Mr. Moki available?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12728.882s">[Knight]</a>: He's not available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12729.423s">[Knight]</a>: Is the city solicitor available?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12735.746s">[Knight]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12736.466s">[Knight]</a>: So I guess my question's to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12737.927s">[Knight]</a>: Number one, say that a rendering, say the rendering that we looked at tonight was suitable to both commissions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12747.972s">[Knight]</a>: And they said, move forward and do what you got to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12750.773s">[Knight]</a>: The gentleman would still be subject to site plan review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12754.667s">[Knight]</a>: through our office of community development, which is an open notorious process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12758.829s">[Knight]</a>: During that site plan review process, because his parcel is an apartment two zone district, and there's a single family home there right now, or a two family home right there right now, it's being underutilized land use, number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12770.715s">[Knight]</a>: Number two, because it's a site plan review project, he's gonna be responsible to pay linkage, Mr. President, on top of going through the site plan review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12776.838s">[Knight]</a>: He's also gonna have to pay linkage to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12778.818s">[Knight]</a>: So we're looking at a parcel that's being underutilized, all right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12781.2s">[Knight]</a>: If an apartment building gets built there, which is it's zoned use,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12785.211s">[Knight]</a>: The tax revenues are going to increase, we're going to be able to get linkage, and we still have two more processes in the review of the design that the city has the ability to take a bite at the apple on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12796.847s">[Knight]</a>: I think that the gentleman has,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12800.211s">[Knight]</a>: taken a lot of wax in terms of this whole entire process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12804.775s">[Knight]</a>: And he's maintained his cool a lot better than I would have been able to with the level of frustration that I think he's met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12812.501s">[Knight]</a>: But ultimately, Mr. President, I don't think any of us behind this rail got in the business to hurt people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12817.025s">[Knight]</a>: And the gentleman's being hurt by the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12820.25s">[Knight]</a>: The gentleman's being hurt by the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12821.671s">[Knight]</a>: And regardless of whether or not the process is what it is, it's not a good process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12824.812s">[Knight]</a>: It needs to be fixed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12826.112s">[Knight]</a>: All right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12826.373s">[Knight]</a>: We took a bad vote when we changed the demolition delay from six months to 18 months, in my opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12830.694s">[Knight]</a>: I think it was a bad vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12832.155s">[Knight]</a>: I really do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12832.995s">[Knight]</a>: I also think it was a bad vote when we changed it to any building that was built in the last 75 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12836.917s">[Knight]</a>: I think it was a bad vote, Mr. President, because I feel like what we're doing is not really looking at historic preservation, but what we're looking at doing is a board that's trying to flex its muscles right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12846.921s">[Knight]</a>: All right, we see a board that's trying to increase its level of influence and power in the community because the corner office, we don't have the strongest leader right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12854.271s">[Knight]</a>: So I think, Mr. President, looking at this, you know what I mean, and the way that it's going, there's two more opportunities for design review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12860.239s">[Knight]</a>: The parcel's a strange shaped parcel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12862.823s">[Knight]</a>: It's going to have to go before the zoning board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12865.093s">[Knight]</a>: It's already been noted in the meetings and noted in the discussions, and based upon the plan that's been presented, it's been determined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12872.38s">[Knight]</a>: So this is nothing more, I think, than a power play at this point, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12875.323s">[Knight]</a>: And I certainly thank the Council if I'm moving it to a vote, and I'll be happy to vote against it this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12882.43s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13060.571s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13061.012s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, if I could just offer an amendment to that paper, a re-paper to that amendment, that the administration provide us with a list of whether or not these contracts are being negotiated by internal counsel or external counsel, and the amount of money that they've spent on external counsel, if they have to do such.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13138.71s">[Knight]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13138.87s">[Knight]</a>: And that can be in the form of a B paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13140.231s">[Knight]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13140.992s">[Knight]</a>: It can be in the form of a B paper or an amendment based upon the preference of the sponsor or the person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15069.651s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, the snow and ice account is the only account that we can run a deficit in here in the city of Medford and across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15076.472s">[Knight]</a>: We heard Marsha this morning, it feels like this morning, earlier in the evening when we were talking about the Lawrence Mural Hospital and she gave us a figure of 20% of the community residents are senior citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15088.155s">[Knight]</a>: I know, I just realized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15089.435s">[Knight]</a>: I'm maybe a little high, but close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15092.618s">[Knight]</a>: You know, the city in the past has had a practice of removing the snow in our business districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15097.282s">[Knight]</a>: We've had a bombardier that's gone down the street and down the sidewalks and removed the snow in front of St.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15103.228s">[Knight]</a>: Joseph's all the way down into Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15104.949s">[Knight]</a>: And that's a practice that we've<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15107.111s">[Knight]</a>: Had in the past, and it's a practice that should continue, when we look at the Department of Conservation and Recreation and we see the roadways that are under their control, they have a bombardier that comes out and clears their sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15117.314s">[Knight]</a>: The Department of Conservation and Recreation, a state agency, Mr. President, goes out and does all of their property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15124.255s">[Knight]</a>: I see no reason why the city of Medford should take steps to hold their citizens to a higher standard than that of their DPW and the contractors that they're hiring to pave the streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15136.619s">[Knight]</a>: We can either pass an ordinance that's going to require the citizens to perform the DPW's job, or we can focus on the delivery of services here in the community for the residents and the taxpayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15145.448s">[Knight]</a>: And the way that we do that is by investing in our DPW, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15149.272s">[Knight]</a>: And that's an area that we've historically not invested in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15152.435s">[Knight]</a>: We say, buy this piece of equipment because you're not going to have the manpower.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15155.378s">[Knight]</a>: We're getting to the point now, Mr. President, where we've got more pieces of equipment than we do people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15159.162s">[Knight]</a>: All right, so we're not going to be able to get anything done if we don't look at what's going on, reallocate funds, and refocus what our priorities are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15166.129s">[Knight]</a>: Because our DPW is failing right now, and they're failing because of one reason, manpower.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15171.533s">[Knight]</a>: Manpower, Mr. President, manpower.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15174.356s">[Knight]</a>: We can have over 100 police officers, over 100 firefighters, but not even 50% of that is part of our DPW?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15183.1s">[Knight]</a>: That's a problem, Mr. President, and I don't think that penalizing residents and homeowners because we're making poor decisions in terms of how we allocate funds is going to be the answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15191.987s">[Knight]</a>: So moving forward, Mr. President, I think it's very important that we look at the reasoning behind why fines for commercial properties have doubled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15199.413s">[Knight]</a>: When we look at commercial properties, they pay a higher tax rate than residential properties here in the community, as do industrial properties, because we have a bifurcated tax rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15207.621s">[Knight]</a>: And we have that tax rate for a reason, to keep residential property taxes low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15212.065s">[Knight]</a>: But at the same time, snow removal, snow removal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15214.347s">[Knight]</a>: Why are we punishing a commercial property owner double what we'd be punishing a industrial property owner or a residential property owner?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15222.654s">[Knight]</a>: I don't understand what the importance of singling out a commercial property for double fines is, when the commercial properties are the ones that actually bring jobs to this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15234.281s">[Knight]</a>: They actually allow people to go to work, who live in Medford, can work in Medford, can play in Medford, can spend their ancillary money in the circular floor of our local economy, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15243.867s">[Knight]</a>: So I think it's very important we recognize the role that commercial properties play in our community, and we shouldn't be singling them out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15250.331s">[Knight]</a>: Every time we talk about zoning, we talk about the fact that we're losing commercial properties left and right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15255.032s">[Knight]</a>: We're down to 7 or 8% of the total number of parcels in our community is going to be commercial industrial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15261.094s">[Knight]</a>: Well, if we keep doing stuff like this and penalizing properties for being commercial when instances arise, then we're going to be in a situation where we're going to see less and less of that, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15269.976s">[Knight]</a>: So I think that the fine should be uniform and across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15272.517s">[Knight]</a>: It shouldn't matter what type of parcel you own.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15276.67s">[Knight]</a>: The fines should be the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15278.251s">[Knight]</a>: That coupled with the fact that I really feel as though we should be investing our efforts and our energies in delivering services as a city and as a community, in addressing some of the issues that Councilor Marks brought up about prioritizing our sidewalks and our roadways and ensuring connectivity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15294.386s">[Knight]</a>: But at the same time, not doing it in a punitive fashion so that our residents are being penalized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15300.63s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, I do think this needs a lot of work, and the paper remains in the subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15306.093s">[Knight]</a>: So we could take a vote on this, or we could just say call the subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15310.956s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, the paper's in the subcommittee already from last term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15313.237s">[Knight]</a>: It is what it is, but I'd move for approval on the paper and the amendments, and I'd like to ask that they be consolidated so that we can vote once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15329.387s">[Knight]</a>: I don't know if there's one in public works or public safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15332.288s">[Knight]</a>: It was in public works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15336.229s">[Knight]</a>: If this is really a priority, Mr. President, last week we asked the city clerk to post three meetings, second Tuesday in October, November, and December, for the purpose of the city solicitor appearing before us to talk about ordinances in the ordinance subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15349.364s">[Knight]</a>: This is an ordinance, this is also a venue that we could take it up in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15352.067s">[Knight]</a>: I know Councilor Beals wants to maintain control of it, so he probably wants it in the committee that he chairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15355.851s">[Knight]</a>: I don't want to speak for him, but you know what I mean, it is what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15358.594s">[Knight]</a>: So either way is fine with me, Mr. President, but those meetings are already going to be posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15362.939s">[Knight]</a>: The clerk's already been directed to do such.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15364.601s">[Knight]</a>: So if we want to talk about existing ordinances, then that's a committee that can be referred to as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15377.142s">[Knight]</a>: I don't have a horse in the game, Mr. President, one way or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15379.985s">[Knight]</a>: It's going to have to go to a committee of the whole before it comes to the council floor, pursuant to council rules anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15506.372s">[Knight]</a>: Point of information, Mr. President, just before we start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15508.954s">[Knight]</a>: I'm sorry, point of information, Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15510.756s">[Knight]</a>: It's 20 past 11 at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15512.417s">[Knight]</a>: We have about 17, 18 other items left on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15515.56s">[Knight]</a>: This matter is going to subcommittee to be vetted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15517.462s">[Knight]</a>: It's going to go to committee of the whole to be vetted further, and then it's going to come back to the council floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15522.026s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15523.51s">[Knight]</a>: We're all going to vote in favor to send this thing to the subcommittee to be discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15527.553s">[Knight]</a>: We've already all spoke on it, and we've already all said that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15530.995s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, there'll be ample opportunity for individuals to provide public participation on the topic that's before us here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15538.1s">[Knight]</a>: They're going to have a subcommittee meeting or multiple subcommittee meetings, a committee of the whole meeting, and then it's going to come back to the council floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15544.224s">[Knight]</a>: Right now, the vote we're taking is only to send it to subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15546.665s">[Knight]</a>: I know there are individuals in the community that support this piece of legislation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15550.988s">[Knight]</a>: But I think in the interest of time, Mr. President, it might make sense for us to say, OK, we're going to send it to subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15555.469s">[Knight]</a>: The subcommittee is going to be scheduled, and the matter is going to be deliberated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15560.27s">[Knight]</a>: And then it's going to go to the committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15561.771s">[Knight]</a>: It's going to be scheduled, deliberated again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15563.291s">[Knight]</a>: Then it's going to be put on the council agenda, and going to move forward again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15566.272s">[Knight]</a>: So everybody's going to have an ample opportunity to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15568.532s">[Knight]</a>: We would have been done by now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16010.345s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16012.866s">[Knight]</a>: In review of the common practice of the council, it's always been that the special permit for extended hours would be granted to the business and not the property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16024.512s">[Knight]</a>: And the business is changing hands, which would require an application for a second<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16032.02s">[Knight]</a>: An application for a permit for extended hours, if I'm not mistaken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16035.301s">[Knight]</a>: So I guess, can the city clerk clarify or confirm whether or not when this initial permit was issued, it was issued to the property or to the business?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16043.682s">[Knight]</a>: And if it was issued to the business, then I believe they'd be required to come back before us for extended hours permit for any operation before 7 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16050.784s">[Knight]</a>: or after 11 p.m., right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16061.391s">[Knight]</a>: And I don't want to hold it up, Mr. President, so I have no problem moving for approval, provided that the clerk gives us the information that we're requesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16071.818s">[Knight]</a>: And if an extended hours permit is necessary, he contacts the business owner prior to their opening and informs them of the process that they need to go through to obtain an extended hours permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16106.952s">[Knight]</a>: It's an operation of government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16108.093s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, if the permit was issued, what they're asking for right now, they can't get if they're not grandfathered in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16114.695s">[Knight]</a>: If they are grandfathered in, they can get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16120.938s">[Knight]</a>: Yeah, let's confirm what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16123.039s">[Knight]</a>: We'll move for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16124.32s">[Knight]</a>: The license is going to be, I'm under the impression it's going to be 7 to 11, unless otherwise with the restrictions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16130.622s">[Knight]</a>: And if not, then the clerk will notify them and have them come back before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16168.93s">[Knight]</a>: Along with the review, Mr. President, I'd like to ask that the permit go with the business entity and not the address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16174.652s">[Knight]</a>: If in fact we need to address the extended hours permit going forward, whether or not there's a way that we can put a mechanism in place so that it now goes with the business and doesn't stay with the process, whether that requires a rescinding of a vote, previous vote or not, but to protect the neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17045.819s">[Knight]</a>: I am all set, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17050.18s">[Knight]</a>: So does this mean they're not going to change the direction of South Street like they were talking about three years ago?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17054.362s">[Knight]</a>: We're going to get the speed bumps instead?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17056.142s">[Knight]</a>: One phone call, Councilor Marks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17057.302s">[Knight]</a>: Great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17060.663s">[Knight]</a>: No, Mr. President, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17062.904s">[Knight]</a>: I think it's important also that because this is an issue of funding coming from partners in state government that we make sure that Representative Donato's informed every step of the way on what efforts we're making as a council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17075.194s">[Knight]</a>: This money didn't get released or given to us because we're good people and we're a nice community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17080.558s">[Knight]</a>: They got released because we were sending them letters once every two months asking them to look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17085.142s">[Knight]</a>: We were bringing our chief of police down there and we were telling them do something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17087.764s">[Knight]</a>: We were looking at statistics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17090.005s">[Knight]</a>: So I think it's very important, Mr. President, that in order to keep the momentum going, that we have our partners in government at the state level involved in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17097.007s">[Knight]</a>: And Representative Donato's been a champion on this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17101.289s">[Knight]</a>: He's been very outspoken in his support for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17103.149s">[Knight]</a>: So I just ask that any time a correspondence goes out relative to the furtherance of this initiative that Representative Donato's offered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17121.618s">[Knight]</a>: He's in a very powerful position, Mr. President, so I think that it's important that he be involved in these conversations as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17128.299s">[Knight]</a>: As the assistant majority leader, he's going to have the ability to control some purse strings and get us some money, and he's done a great job of that in the past, and I'm sure he'll continue to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17135.801s">[Knight]</a>: So I'd ask that he be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18137.504s">[Knight]</a>: Again, Mr. President, the way that things have gone down with the Historical Commission in the past, oh, eight, nine months would lead me to believe that I don't want them to do anything other than what they were doing before what they were doing the last eight or nine months ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18149.967s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, I'm opposed to Councilor Caraviello's measure this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18153.947s">[Knight]</a>: I feel as though the Historical Commission is exceeding their authority underneath the statute and the efforts and endeavors that they've undertaken in recent months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18161.229s">[Knight]</a>: And for that reason, I will be opposing this this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18238.344s">[Knight]</a>: One more information, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18253.855s">[Knight]</a>: It's problematic, Mr. President, when everybody that you talk to says they're having some sort of problem getting a permit, some sort of problem getting a permit, unless they know somebody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18262.301s">[Knight]</a>: They call a city councilor and then they get, oh yeah, it's no problem, I'll get you in a half an hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18265.764s">[Knight]</a>: If they don't know somebody, though, they're held up for 17 months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18269.369s">[Knight]</a>: All right, that's a problem, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18271.25s">[Knight]</a>: I feel as though that's a very big problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18273.31s">[Knight]</a>: I also think it's a problem that, you know, there's no guidance from the administration as to how this process is supposed to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18279.933s">[Knight]</a>: So now Paul Moky's supposed to notify someone or the building commissioner, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18285.475s">[Knight]</a>: The building department's supposed to notify residents which have had their buildings permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18289.096s">[Knight]</a>: permits reviewed by the historical commission within 72 hours after the review has been completed of the decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18295.259s">[Knight]</a>: Nothing prompts the historical commission to notify the building commissioner within a defined period of time when they get the application or after they make their decision to tell the building commissioner when it is that they can pull the trigger on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18307.284s">[Knight]</a>: This is a flawed process from the start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18308.945s">[Knight]</a>: The changes that have been implemented over the last year, Mr. President, are detrimental to the growth in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18378.952s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, if your application is before a board or a commission and they vote on it, the board of commission should be the one telling you what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18384.256s">[Knight]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18405.247s">[Knight]</a>: There needs to be, someone needs to define who's responsible for issuing a building permit in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18410.928s">[Knight]</a>: I think that's the building commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18412.368s">[Knight]</a>: It always has been in the past, just like he's always been the person responsible for zoning, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18417.369s">[Knight]</a>: So I think that although the council feels as though I'm comparing apples to oranges, I don't think that's necessarily the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18425.331s">[Knight]</a>: I feel as though I'm comparing overstep and overstep based upon the statutory guidelines and the ordinance that's in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18431.826s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18478.149s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, but again, the mechanism is when is the building department getting notified when the determination is being made?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18485.212s">[Knight]</a>: And is there a criteria or a timeline for when that determination needs to be made from the ancillary secondary body?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18491.57s">[Knight]</a>: So can I get a building permit and go give it to Paul Moki and he says, OK, yeah, this has to go to Historic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18497.113s">[Knight]</a>: He gives it to Historic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18498.373s">[Knight]</a>: Historic has a meeting on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18499.734s">[Knight]</a>: Neva tells him about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18500.795s">[Knight]</a>: Or Historic doesn't have a meeting on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18502.115s">[Knight]</a>: It has a meeting on it in 45 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18503.916s">[Knight]</a>: Are there any defined parameters or timelines?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18507.338s">[Knight]</a>: That's the concern, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18509.339s">[Knight]</a>: There's a breakdown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18526.845s">[Knight]</a>: Point of information, Mr. President, I think it's been made clear by the council is that as long as you know a Councilor and pick up the phone, there is no breakdown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18531.686s">[Knight]</a>: But if you don't know a Councilor and you can't pick up the phone, then there is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18610.324s">[Knight]</a>: Motion to receive and place on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18611.365s">[Knight]</a>: It's a move point, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18612.566s">[Knight]</a>: We took the vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18735.355s">[Knight]</a>: Is there a committee report?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18740.457s">[Knight]</a>: Is there one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18744.679s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18814.975s">[Knight]</a>: Motion to take papers in the hands of the clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18816.816s">[Knight]</a>: No, we have two more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=19237.847s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=104.076s">[Knight]</a>: Proposed hours of operation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=105.417s">[Knight]</a>: I'm sorry, what are the proposed hours of operation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=109.6s">[Knight]</a>: Your hours of operation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=134.559s">[Knight]</a>: Will there be any alcohol served on the premises, or is there an application for a license to serve any alcohol?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=141.224s">[Knight]</a>: A license to serve any alcohol?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=144.826s">[Knight]</a>: Is there a dining option, or is this exclusively takeout?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=182.802s">[Knight]</a>: One last item, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=185.624s">[Knight]</a>: 21561 on the suspension item offered by President Caraviello relative to Vernon Street construction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=316.909s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=395.498s">[Knight]</a>: You're offering that in the form of a motion, Councilor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=401.562s">[Knight]</a>: Amendment, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=536.277s">[Knight]</a>: Is there anybody from the public that would like to speak on this issue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=540.319s">[Knight]</a>: Come right up, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=936.851s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. Leary, if I may, can I just ask that you leave your address for the record with the clerk, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=947.015s">[Knight]</a>: He didn't give his address, I'm sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=950.936s">[Knight]</a>: Yeah, 40 Vernon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=977.41s">[Knight]</a>: Not only kids go sledding up there, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=979.831s">[Knight]</a>: Might be guilty of sledding up there in the last snowstorm as well with my children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=985.458s">[Knight]</a>: On the motion by Council car below as amended by Councilor Morell asking how often they switch out design specifications in the contract further amended by Council Mac marks asking for the job specifications versus the final product.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=999.664s">[Knight]</a>: And whether or not this grant will be temporary this concrete will be temporary until granted is installed and what's the difference in price regarding the approved work order versus the current construction materials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=1038.835s">[Knight]</a>: So you're asking the reservicing aspects of the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=1041.537s">[Knight]</a>: Yeah, just the reservicing aspects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=1042.878s">[Knight]</a>: Once we service, you're not going to be able to take those curbs out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=1288.6s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=1290.121s">[Knight]</a>: This was a topic at last week's meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=1292.223s">[Knight]</a>: We certainly discussed it at length.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=1295.822s">[Knight]</a>: resulting in this Council calling for a special emergency meeting on Saturday to discuss the staffing levels in our veteran service office and what's going on down there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=1304.167s">[Knight]</a>: I think we're all well aware of the circumstances and the situation that gave rise to this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=1308.69s">[Knight]</a>: I don't think we need to recreate history or beat a dead horse, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=1311.491s">[Knight]</a>: What we need to do is get Mike Durham back to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=1313.713s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, I offer this resolution this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=1316.074s">[Knight]</a>: I ask my Council colleagues to support it, to reinstate Mike Durham to the position of veteran service officer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=1321.017s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=1322.418s">[Knight]</a>: That's my Council colleagues to support the measure and I move for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=1326.276s">[Knight]</a>: Questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=1793.436s">[Knight]</a>: One information, Vice President Knight, on that point, not only are they doing a disservice to the veterans in this community, they're doing a disservice to Mike Durham, the human being, a husband, a father, someone who served this country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=1806.298s">[Knight]</a>: They're doing a disservice to him too, leaving him hanging out there like this, using him as a political pawn because they don't like the pressure he's putting on him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=1814.08s">[Knight]</a>: Enough's enough with this, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=1815.78s">[Knight]</a>: It's time he gets back to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=1817.82s">[Knight]</a>: They're playing with a man's life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=1820.041s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2686.476s">[Knight]</a>: Has the administration answered the question as to how Mr. Chimaya is getting paid?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3090.081s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much, and I appreciate you co-sponsoring this resolution with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3094.184s">[Knight]</a>: Paul McGillivray.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3095.609s">[Knight]</a>: born and raised on Marion Street in South Medford, son of Harold McGilvery senior, a very, very, very recognized cop that served in the city of Medford on the NBC was injured in the line of duty and actually passed away very recently from the injuries that he sustained on that fateful night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3113.141s">[Knight]</a>: Following in his father's footsteps, Paul became a Metro Police Officer some 25 years ago, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3118.124s">[Knight]</a>: And during that 25 years, Paul was so happy to say when I spoke to him the other day with a smile on his face that he had an unblemished record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3125.428s">[Knight]</a>: In 25 years of service as a Metro Police Officer, he had a perfect record, an unblemished record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3130.33s">[Knight]</a>: And for 25 years, he served his community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3132.592s">[Knight]</a>: But a number of years ago, he moved up to the town of Wilmington, where he and his wife, Andrea, began to raise their wonderful family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3139.295s">[Knight]</a>: And Paul had a great opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3141.158s">[Knight]</a>: to transfer departments and to now work in the town that he lives in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3144.3s">[Knight]</a>: So born and raised in Medford, he had the opportunity to do 25 years here in the city of Medford, protecting the residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3149.585s">[Knight]</a>: And now he's gonna have the opportunity to do that up in Wilmington, the town that he lives in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3152.887s">[Knight]</a>: So I wish Paul the best of luck to his health, to his safety, and most importantly, to his happiness, to have the opportunity to be close to his family, to be in his neighborhood and to work in his hometown is something that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3163.175s">[Knight]</a>: It's something that we all relish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3164.616s">[Knight]</a>: So I congratulate him and I wish him the best of luck moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3167.819s">[Knight]</a>: He's a great individual, just a great person to be around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3170.481s">[Knight]</a>: A lot of fun, a lot of knowledge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3172.342s">[Knight]</a>: A cop's cop, as they like to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3175.685s">[Knight]</a>: He gets out of the car, he does his job, he does the work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3178.366s">[Knight]</a>: He's someone that's gonna be sadly missed, and they're gonna have a big pair of boots to fill down there at Medford Police Department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3183.069s">[Knight]</a>: With Paul McGilvray leaving, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3184.891s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6296.957s">[Knight]</a>: because it's obviously I certainly disagree with that, but Diane McLeod did yeoman's work on this when it came to diversity and disability issues, especially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6307.047s">[Knight]</a>: Um, I mean, she would, she'd be in her office with blueprints on restaurants being made and making sure that there were accessible pathways for individuals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6313.473s">[Knight]</a>: Um, and it was a diversity and disability office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6315.675s">[Knight]</a>: Um, we've seen the focus of the office change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6317.978s">[Knight]</a>: Um, we've seen the office actually be proposed to be eliminated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6322.225s">[Knight]</a>: And that was the priority that this council made, to keep the diversity office alive, because that office was going to be gone entirely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6328.511s">[Knight]</a>: Entirely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6328.951s">[Knight]</a>: It was just going to be the office of human resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6331.553s">[Knight]</a>: There was not going to be an office of diversity inclusion anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6334.096s">[Knight]</a>: It was going to be gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6334.776s">[Knight]</a>: And that was the stand this council took.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6336.998s">[Knight]</a>: We said, there's going to be a circumstance or a situation that comes up where the director of human resources is sitting on an interview panel, say, and an individual that's interviewed feels as though<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6349.994s">[Knight]</a>: There was some miss miss malfeasance or what we're giving a fair shake the civil rights of violate whatever it was, who do they go to the human resource officer to just sat on the panel just told them they don't get the job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6361.297s">[Knight]</a>: That was the conflict that we were talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6362.838s">[Knight]</a>: That was the first sign that we really saw that we need to make a commitment to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6368.082s">[Knight]</a>: We can talk all we want to talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6369.683s">[Knight]</a>: But at the end of the day, where do we put the money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6371.444s">[Knight]</a>: We put the money into the diversity office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6372.885s">[Knight]</a>: We made it a council priority to keep that diversity office alive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6375.767s">[Knight]</a>: And that's what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6376.848s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, I think when we look at the steps the administration's taken, we're seeing a lot of press releases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6382.452s">[Knight]</a>: We're seeing a lot of press releases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6383.553s">[Knight]</a>: We're seeing a lot of Facebook posts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6384.694s">[Knight]</a>: But we're seeing a lack of communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6386.775s">[Knight]</a>: We're seeing a lack of communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6387.816s">[Knight]</a>: We have a communications director that does a great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6390.017s">[Knight]</a>: She has a great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6390.818s">[Knight]</a>: She puts a great press.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6392.539s">[Knight]</a>: But we need to get in the same room and sit down and talk about some of these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6395.901s">[Knight]</a>: And it's not just related to issues of race and equity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6399.103s">[Knight]</a>: It's related to fiscal responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6400.784s">[Knight]</a>: It's related to service delivery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6402.305s">[Knight]</a>: There's a real breakdown in communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6405.947s">[Knight]</a>: My father was a great athlete.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6407.068s">[Knight]</a>: He was the athletic director over at the city of Somerville for, I can't tell you, 25 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6411.651s">[Knight]</a>: He always talked about athletes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6413.012s">[Knight]</a>: And he said that an athlete's number one ability is their availability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6416.556s">[Knight]</a>: If they're not available they can't play, right, if the mayor is not available to take these conversations with us and to come to our meetings when we ask her to be here to address issues of inequity, then how are we supposed to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6432.401s">[Knight]</a>: How are we supposed to move forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6433.362s">[Knight]</a>: We can all stand behind the rail, and we can bang the table, and we can give the good speeches, and we can talk for 20 and 30 and 40 minutes at a time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6438.646s">[Knight]</a>: Listen, everybody behind this rail can talk, and we can talk the dog off a meat wagon, every single one of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6442.789s">[Knight]</a>: You've seen it before, and you'll see it again, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6445.031s">[Knight]</a>: But at the end of the day, it's all smoke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6447.593s">[Knight]</a>: It's all smoke, unless, like Councilor Falco says, someone takes that document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6452.356s">[Knight]</a>: That's the mayor's roadmap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6454.118s">[Knight]</a>: That's what it says right on the top of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6455.599s">[Knight]</a>: That's who's in charge of that document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6457.04s">[Knight]</a>: The mayor's in charge of that document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6458.221s">[Knight]</a>: That's the mayor's roadmap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6460.117s">[Knight]</a>: The mayor's roadmap, not the council's, not Neil Osborne's, not anybody else's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6464.199s">[Knight]</a>: That's the mayor's roadmap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6465.26s">[Knight]</a>: And that's who should be owning this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6469.542s">[Knight]</a>: In terms of the implementation of public policy and implementation of public policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8397.578s">[Knight]</a>: We're not going to talk about all the service to the community, the housing authority, the city council, United States of America as a veteran, 75 years in this wonderful city, a West Medford guy over here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8407.761s">[Knight]</a>: Come on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8408.441s">[Knight]</a>: We got to give him a little bit of kudos on his birthday, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8454.546s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8455.887s">[Knight]</a>: Both Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8457.367s">[Knight]</a>: General Lasky and Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8458.928s">[Knight]</a>: Murray have served on the Board of Registrars for an extended period of time, as long as I can remember.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8464.212s">[Knight]</a>: They've both served this city diligently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8466.253s">[Knight]</a>: They've done a great job working with our election staff to ensure that our elections roll out smoothly, to ensure that our elections policy is fair and equitable, and to be sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8476.94s">[Knight]</a>: We get the job done when it comes down to one of the most important functions of city government, which is conducting municipal and state elections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8485.807s">[Knight]</a>: So both members of the board have sought retirement after this recent primary election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8491.252s">[Knight]</a>: And I think that it's only warranted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8497.096s">[Knight]</a>: So I bring forward this resolution, Mr. President, congratulating them for their service and dedication to the community and ask them to council colleagues support the resolve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8506.164s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=474.163s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=477.346s">[Knight]</a>: Marianne, it sure sounds like there's a lot going on in your office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=479.408s">[Knight]</a>: You're pretty busy, isn't that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=480.649s">[Knight]</a>: A little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=488.412s">[Knight]</a>: So how many I guess you're putting in on average, you and your staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=508.898s">[Knight]</a>: So 12 hours a day, seven days a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=513.479s">[Knight]</a>: And then how many how many members do you have in your staff up there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=549.526s">[Knight]</a>: Plus this new permitting thing, huh?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=552.928s">[Knight]</a>: With LaConti and home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=570.079s">[Knight]</a>: So you think your office has the capacity based upon the number of hours that everybody's putting in right now to do these?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=574.98s">[Knight]</a>: pre-screenings of applications for people that are looking to rent the Hormel Stadium on the Coffey Rink?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=580.121s">[Knight]</a>: We've been doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=581.441s">[Knight]</a>: We've been doing that since the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=584.822s">[Knight]</a>: No, it was never a pre-screening before you could apply or get placement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=589.283s">[Knight]</a>: It should have been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=589.783s">[Knight]</a>: It should have been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=603.877s">[Knight]</a>: So so how's this going to work now can you just explain to me based upon you know the fact that your office is going to be handling the majority of these requests how this permitting is going to work for home Ellen my look on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=626.564s">[Knight]</a>: The fact that we got an email this morning saying that they've made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=629.232s">[Knight]</a>: a number of changes to the way that two of our revenue-generating properties that we have here in the community are gonna be conducted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=635.997s">[Knight]</a>: Now, previously the way it worked would be that the applicant would seek placement at La Conte O'Hamel, they'd be provided placement, they'd be put in the schedule, they'd then have to go through a screening process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=647.805s">[Knight]</a>: And now it looks like that process is backwards or different, it seems like, from what I understood from this email that I got from Mayor Ungo, that she's taking control of some of the authority that the O'Hamel Commission has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=658.925s">[Knight]</a>: relative to how they're supposed to be, you know, scheduling and booking events.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=663.969s">[Knight]</a>: And where these are two revenue generating facilities that we have here in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=669.733s">[Knight]</a>: And quite frankly, they're very successful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=672.074s">[Knight]</a>: If it ain't broken, don't try to fix it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=726.707s">[Knight]</a>: Is that what happened with Ellington Catholic?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=728.709s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=730.03s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=731.751s">[Knight]</a>: It makes sense, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=733.012s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, if they have a plan that's in place, I mean, the CDC guidelines are going to be controlling it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=737.575s">[Knight]</a>: You know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=739.676s">[Knight]</a>: we're really... They weren't following the guidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=742.557s">[Knight]</a>: That was the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=746.199s">[Knight]</a>: Let me tell you what, every single event that took place down there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=748.44s">[Knight]</a>: So I'm pretty sure, you know, they may or may not have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=751.322s">[Knight]</a>: I think that that's a blood accusation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=753.083s">[Knight]</a>: In any organization that hasn't followed the CDC guidelines, I'm sure that your office has taken the appropriate steps to find them and document such, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=787.128s">[Knight]</a>: Wouldn't it make it more sense from a number one, a consistency of government standpoint, number two, an operational standpoint that- No, not in a pandemic, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=798.392s">[Knight]</a>: I'm done talking, Rick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=799.592s">[Knight]</a>: I'm done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=801.906s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not going to be able to finish, Mr. President, so I'll just stop right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=805.127s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1941.695s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I'm just taking a look at the zoning use chart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1945.215s">[Knight]</a>: And I certainly don't have any issue with Millett Automotive taking over this Fantasia Automotive location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1950.796s">[Knight]</a>: I live in West Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1951.817s">[Knight]</a>: I know Mr. Millett, I see the type of business he's done down there for a number of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1955.997s">[Knight]</a>: He's done a great job over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1957.138s">[Knight]</a>: He keeps his lot clean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1959.138s">[Knight]</a>: He is a good neighbor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1960.678s">[Knight]</a>: So I have no issue or concern whatsoever about his ability or whether or not he'll be a good neighbor at the Fantasia site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1966.381s">[Knight]</a>: But in looking at the zoning use chart, it says that under use 27, the accessory storage conducted entirely with an enclosed structure, the sale of rental motor vehicles, exclusive abuse car sales in a C1 district would be required for a special permit of the council, but it would also be required to be referred to the community development board first for review, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1988.339s">[Knight]</a>: I certainly don't have any issue approving this license this evening,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1992.549s">[Knight]</a>: However, if there is a requirement that it has to go before the CD board for hearing of some sort, I do want to make sure that the council is in compliance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1999.511s">[Knight]</a>: So I guess the question would lie as to whether or not Mr. Moki designates this application as a use 27 on the principal use chart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2008.273s">[Knight]</a>: So we'll refer it to, if there's an issue, we'll refer it over to Mike and step out and call him even Mr. President, because I don't want to hold Mr. Mullet up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2015.975s">[Knight]</a>: This is more of a technicality and formality than anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2104.875s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2106.296s">[Knight]</a>: Yes, the Lawrence Memorial Hospital was kind enough to forward all the correspondence this morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2111.279s">[Knight]</a>: The correspondence would provide us with an update as to the status of the ongoing construction of the ambulatory care center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2117.403s">[Knight]</a>: This email goes on to read that beginning on Monday, March 22nd, we will begin planting trees and plants in the parking lot, islands, and surrounding buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2125.288s">[Knight]</a>: This work should be completed by Friday, March 26th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2127.909s">[Knight]</a>: So that looks like that was last week, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2130.231s">[Knight]</a>: Landscaping work will be taking place on the corner of Governor's Avenue and Lawrence Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2134.266s">[Knight]</a>: and crews will be placing loom to prep for seating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2138.127s">[Knight]</a>: Following the completion of the landscaping work, the repaving of the parking lot is scheduled to take place during the week of April 5th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2144.209s">[Knight]</a>: All work is weather dependent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2146.37s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, also in their correspondence, if you bear with me for one moment where I can find the other section of it, I will tell you that at 5.30 PM, the caffeine inside lobby lights will be reduced to 30%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2159.775s">[Knight]</a>: At 7 PM daily, the exterior bulbs and canopy lights will shut off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2163.886s">[Knight]</a>: And at 8 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2164.987s">[Knight]</a>: the ambulatory surgical care centers lights will shut off as well as the PACU, which faces the lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2172.353s">[Knight]</a>: Also the landscaping work was what the major activity was on the corner of Governor's Avenue, Winthrop Street, that was such a concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2178.678s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not Winthrop by Governor's Avenue and Lawrence Road, which was such a concern, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2183.281s">[Knight]</a>: So that's the latest update from the Lawrence Memorial Hospital based upon the correspondence that they were so kind to forward to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2386.571s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, that'd be 90 days after it opens, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2737.563s">[Knight]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2740.845s">[Knight]</a>: Vice President Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2741.865s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2744.026s">[Knight]</a>: I remember this bus line is how all the kids from the Heights got the public skating when we were kids growing up and Kenny Phillips would be driving the bus and bringing everybody up and down the hill and putting up with kids to watch around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2755.792s">[Knight]</a>: But no, in all seriousness, it's not just kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2758.873s">[Knight]</a>: It's not just seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2759.653s">[Knight]</a>: It's not just commuters that are using this bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2762.034s">[Knight]</a>: This is really one of the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2764.341s">[Knight]</a>: only bus lines that we have here in the community that connects certain portions of Fulton Heights to the rest of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2771.005s">[Knight]</a>: You know, the MBTA talks about how they wanna restore service to pre-pandemic levels, but they're not gonna.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2777.249s">[Knight]</a>: The MBTA talks about how they want to see increases in ridership as the Metropolitan Area Planning Council has all the communities surrounding us stop more and more people into high rise luxury condominiums.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2789.657s">[Knight]</a>: The MBTA continues to cut service, cut lines,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2792.84s">[Knight]</a>: You know, with the 326, the 325, the 710 commuter rail hours are being cut back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2797.742s">[Knight]</a>: The service that's being provided to this community, Mr. President, in my opinion, does not add up to the amount of money that we're paying on our assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2804.944s">[Knight]</a>: And quite frankly, I feel like Medford is somewhat always the heel because of where we are geographically located between that crux of rail service and bus service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2814.087s">[Knight]</a>: We get beat up on both ends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2815.247s">[Knight]</a>: You know, we look at the issues that we've had over time with the Salem Street car bond,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2821.175s">[Knight]</a>: and other facilities here in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2823.096s">[Knight]</a>: And when we raise concern, they fall on deaf ears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2826.179s">[Knight]</a>: But when the MBTA wants to come in and cut service, it's pat on the back and, you know, take your lumps kid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2833.263s">[Knight]</a>: It's getting kind of old, Mr. President, quite frankly, and I'm tired of the attacks that we're seeing the MBTA take on our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2839.648s">[Knight]</a>: The MBTA raises that green flag, the Green Line extension, and they say, well, we're giving you the Green Line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2844.551s">[Knight]</a>: Well, I'm going to tell you right now, I know a lot of people in the Fulton Heights that are never going to see that Green Line extension, they're never going to step foot on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2850.097s">[Knight]</a>: But I'll tell you what, the 710 bus does a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2852.82s">[Knight]</a>: So I thank you and I thank Councilor Falco for putting this resolution forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2856.084s">[Knight]</a>: It does bring back some great memories of taking that bus as a child being from West Metro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2859.768s">[Knight]</a>: And there was no other way to get up to the heights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2862.211s">[Knight]</a>: I certainly wasn't walking that hill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2863.813s">[Knight]</a>: That's for sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2864.714s">[Knight]</a>: And as a child, Cow Park was one of the most active parks in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2869.532s">[Knight]</a>: There was no other park where you could find a better pickup basketball game besides Carr Park and Duggar Park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2874.233s">[Knight]</a>: Two parks that always had kids playing, Harris Park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2876.214s">[Knight]</a>: The three parks that always had kids playing, all geographically located in the community that are real far apart from each other, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2881.575s">[Knight]</a>: So this connectivity is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2883.536s">[Knight]</a>: We talk about wanting to take cars off the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2885.356s">[Knight]</a>: We're putting bike lanes in, bus lanes in, and everything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2887.777s">[Knight]</a>: How can we put bus lanes on Mystic Avenue and then take away a bus in the community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2891.098s">[Knight]</a>: Don't we want to promote bus use?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2893.334s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, I thank you both for putting this resolution on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2896.376s">[Knight]</a>: I just ask that it also be sent copies to our state delegation so that they're aware of this correspondence going out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4653.758s">[Knight]</a>: I do think it's important to point out, Mr. President, that when this matter came before the council,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4657.622s">[Knight]</a>: The vote that the council was asked to take was to whether or not they were going to allow the administration to enter into a contract that exceeds 36 months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4664.865s">[Knight]</a>: Pursuant to state law, a municipality can only enter into a contract with a maximum term of 36 months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4669.948s">[Knight]</a>: So the issue that was before the council wasn't whether or not we wanted to have pocket meters or no pocket meters, have pocket enforcement officers, but not have pocket enforcement officers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4677.011s">[Knight]</a>: The issue before the council at the time was whether or not we wanted to authorize the administration the opportunity to negotiate a contract that exceeded three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4684.115s">[Knight]</a>: So that was the matter that was before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4685.455s">[Knight]</a>: I certainly have the same concerns that I had<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4687.654s">[Knight]</a>: Um, for previously when it comes to Republic packing and the accounting methodology that's being used with the president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4693.079s">[Knight]</a>: Um, but that's neither here nor there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4694.4s">[Knight]</a>: The administration is the entity that's responsible for the chief negotiation of the contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4698.564s">[Knight]</a>: And these three air extensions are going to be incumbent upon her purview, not us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1405.226s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, you're the chair you can pick what you want so it doesn't matter to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1451.244s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1453.664s">[Knight]</a>: So Tim, as I understand the project that's before us this evening, the only matter that the council really has the purview to vote on this evening would be whether or not we authorize the land taking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1464.266s">[Knight]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1480.841s">[Knight]</a>: And I did hear in your presentation that a hundred percent of the property owners that are impacted by this have signed off on the project There's there's no actual sign off Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1549.565s">[Knight]</a>: So, but you've, so have you had, has their personal contact been made with 100% of the people that are going to be impacted by this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1556.09s">[Knight]</a>: Yes, that is correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1557.831s">[Knight]</a>: I just, you know, I don't want to see this thing, say we vote on it tonight and then tomorrow someone saying, what the hell are they doing on my front lawn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1564.716s">[Knight]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1565.456s">[Knight]</a>: I want to make sure that everybody's well aware.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1568.218s">[Knight]</a>: Communications have been a strong suit in the city of Medford when it comes to certain aspects of construction projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1648.946s">[Knight]</a>: So based on the current financial state at the federal and state level, is that commitment for those funds still there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1661.658s">[Knight]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1662.458s">[Knight]</a>: And the last question that I have, and I promise it's my last question, would be, what's the estimated cost to the taxpayer for the completion of this project?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1672.063s">[Knight]</a>: You said it's about $83,000 in Chapter 90 funds that we're going to be using from our budget that would go to roadway repairs for this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1679.026s">[Knight]</a>: Is there any other expenditure that would have to come out of the city's coffers in order for us to complete the project?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1719.18s">[Knight]</a>: You know if there's any water valves that need to be replaced we replace them things like that In terms of just the scope of the grant, you know, I mean, I'm not worried about other structure projects that might come along with it I mean if we're planning smartly, I would hope that that's what we do I would hope that if we're gonna up the street that we go on the ground and we fix the underground infrastructure to Yeah, but in terms of the funds Yeah, okay<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1742.782s">[Knight]</a>: All right, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1743.702s">[Knight]</a>: But it wouldn't exceed $100,000 is what you're telling me based upon the 83,000 from the Chapter 90 funds and then any ancillary costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1764.509s">[Knight]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1765.75s">[Knight]</a>: It's already been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1767.213s">[Knight]</a>: That money's out the window already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1774.079s">[Knight]</a>: Right, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1775.04s">[Knight]</a>: All right, so in terms of the overall investment that the city's made in the return on the investment, we're looking at making an investment of maybe somewhere around $150,000 for the total cost to the community, and we're getting a million point two back?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1788.572s">[Knight]</a>: Yeah, that's a good way to put it, yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1790.453s">[Knight]</a>: Okay, excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1791.194s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you, Mr. McGiven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1791.995s">[Knight]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1792.555s">[Knight]</a>: You always do come prepared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1793.876s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3522.196s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I think based upon what I'm hearing from my colleagues that this thing's ready for a vote and I'd move for approval of the paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3530.422s">[Knight]</a>: Second Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4644.653s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4658.338s">[Knight]</a>: I'm getting an unstable connection right now, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4667.631s">[Knight]</a>: Motion to receive and place on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4940.337s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4941.878s">[Knight]</a>: And I thank you for going through that very long history that was outlined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4947.523s">[Knight]</a>: in the resolution that Councilor Caraviello and I have put together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4951.744s">[Knight]</a>: Ultimately, it was a long resolution because there's a longstanding history of the allowance of a use variance here in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4958.526s">[Knight]</a>: And if you look at the history, Mr. President, you'll see that in 2016, an opinion was asked of the solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4965.249s">[Knight]</a>: The solicitor produced an opinion that said use variances were authorized in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4970.73s">[Knight]</a>: In 2017, we had a proposal<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4973.513s">[Knight]</a>: that was made by a Councilor to deauthorize use variances in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4978.296s">[Knight]</a>: If, in fact, use variances weren't authorized in the city of Medford, there would be no need for a Councilor to file a paper requesting that they be deauthorized in 2017.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4988.702s">[Knight]</a>: In 2018, Mr. President, another paper was offered before the council by a Councilor to deauthorize the use variance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4996.107s">[Knight]</a>: Again, this paper failed to pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4999.136s">[Knight]</a>: If use variances did not exist in the city of Medford, there would be no need for the legislative body to bring a proposal forward to deauthorize the use variance in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5008.962s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, then we have a roll call vote that passed by super majority, adopting the city solicitor's opinion of August 12th, 2016, which states that use variances are allowed and authorized in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5026.567s">[Knight]</a>: The solicitor's opinion went on to say that the codified ordinances in the city of Medford do not reflect such.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5033.412s">[Knight]</a>: There was a Scribner's error that has been made and that we can correct this Scribner's error by passage of resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5041.918s">[Knight]</a>: The council passed paper 18376, which called for adoption of the city solicitor's opinion and amendment to the codified ordinance to reflect such.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5053.413s">[Knight]</a>: Allowing the use variance has been a longstanding policy in the city of Medford, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5058.895s">[Knight]</a>: It is the public policy established by the council, the legislative arm of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5065.417s">[Knight]</a>: It is the job of the boards and commissions in this community not to establish public policy, but to execute it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5071.919s">[Knight]</a>: When applicants before the Zoning Board of Appeals are being told inaccurate information that use variances are prohibited, when they clearly are allowed,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5080.089s">[Knight]</a>: as supported by the opinion of the solicitor, the lack of a legal challenge, and the action of the legislative body in the community, this irresponsible action opens up the city to vulnerabilities and liabilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5093.513s">[Knight]</a>: Applicants before the Zoning Board of Appeals have the right to be heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5097.034s">[Knight]</a>: The Zoning Board of Appeals has applicants before it that are requesting use variances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5105.616s">[Knight]</a>: The Zoning Board of Appeals is raising the question,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5108.186s">[Knight]</a>: Do use variances exist in the city of Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5111.348s">[Knight]</a>: That question has been answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5112.669s">[Knight]</a>: It's been answered and it's been time-tested, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5116.512s">[Knight]</a>: The Zoning Board of Appeals is in a position right now to take a look at this issue, to reaffirm the opinion of the city solicitor or to challenge it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5124.637s">[Knight]</a>: But applicants that come before the Zoning Board shouldn't be turned around, turned away when someone makes a statement saying, I don't have the authority to issue use variances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5133.743s">[Knight]</a>: They're not authorized in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5135.796s">[Knight]</a>: when the legislative history clearly indicates that they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5138.94s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my council colleagues to support this resolution as before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5436.044s">[Knight]</a>: Yes, Mr. President, ultimately,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5438.114s">[Knight]</a>: The city solicitor came up with an opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5439.935s">[Knight]</a>: The opinion has gone unchallenged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5442.497s">[Knight]</a>: In 2018, this council by a super majority vote adopted that solicitor's opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5447.48s">[Knight]</a>: If we look back at the lawsuit from 2016, one thing I think that we're failing to talk about is the fact that we got thrown out of court by the judge by having no standing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5458.568s">[Knight]</a>: The issue has never been decided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5459.989s">[Knight]</a>: It was never challenged because it was never decided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5462.531s">[Knight]</a>: Ultimately, the question before this council is, have we adopted<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5467.349s">[Knight]</a>: The city solicited his opinion based upon the research that he performed, which would be the law of the community that says use variances are allowed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5475.852s">[Knight]</a>: This council has adopted that opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5477.892s">[Knight]</a>: That is the legislative history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5479.913s">[Knight]</a>: The Zoning Board of Appeals is authorized to move forward on the...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5500.743s">[Knight]</a>: To change that, there's a process to go about changing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5503.645s">[Knight]</a>: When Papers 17007 and Papers 18354 came before the council, they failed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5510.71s">[Knight]</a>: In 2016, we challenged the local street development, and there was a discussion about use variances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5518.535s">[Knight]</a>: In 2016, the solicitor also put an opinion, and it said use variances are authorized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5523.012s">[Knight]</a>: In 2017, a paper was filed to deauthorize use variances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5528.214s">[Knight]</a>: In 2018, a paper was filed to deauthorize use variances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5531.336s">[Knight]</a>: If use variances didn't exist, there'd be no need to file the papers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5535.077s">[Knight]</a>: In 2018, the council then went on to say, look it, use variances do exist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5539.859s">[Knight]</a>: It is the legislative intent of this body, the legislative body responsible for the implementation of the Zoning Act to clarify that this does exist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5549.683s">[Knight]</a>: And we want to pass this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5551.84s">[Knight]</a>: clarification on to the Zoning Board of Appeals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5554.341s">[Knight]</a>: That's what this paper is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5555.921s">[Knight]</a>: You know, use variances are allowed because that's been determined by the city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5561.103s">[Knight]</a>: And that's the law of the land.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5625.505s">[Knight]</a>: You're the point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5707.127s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I do believe that I've presented quite a bit of documentation relative to the fact, and that documentation was produced by the administration and produced by the city's lawyer, the city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5716.293s">[Knight]</a>: Ultimately, I think we need to keep the facts straight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5719.115s">[Knight]</a>: What the council appealed,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5721.707s">[Knight]</a>: was whether or not we had standing, not whether or not use variances exist in the city of Medford or anything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5727.688s">[Knight]</a>: What we appealed was whether or not we had standing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5730.169s">[Knight]</a>: And then we went through that appeal and we negotiated a settlement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5733.39s">[Knight]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5734.11s">[Knight]</a>: So ultimately the history is there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5736.651s">[Knight]</a>: The legislative history clearly shows what the intent is of this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5740.612s">[Knight]</a>: And we have a solicitor's opinion that comes well before the council took these votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5745.593s">[Knight]</a>: So I leave it up to my council colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5748.634s">[Knight]</a>: I move for approval of the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5750.543s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I don't think that, you know, presenting facts to the Zoning Board of Appeals based upon the legislative history of this body and the opinion of the city solicitor does anything other than reaffirm our position on use variances and let them know where we stand so that moving forward, we're all working in concert with the intent of the Zoning Act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5802.877s">[Knight]</a>: Actually, to clarify, Mr. President, I'm referring to the council vote that was taken on paper 18376 by roll call, which passed with supermajority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5810.595s">[Knight]</a>: You know, um, the legislation passed, this body passed a resolution, that resolution reaffirmed the solicitor's opinion and corrected the scriveners that were in the codified version of our ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5822.246s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, I don't know how much simpler it has to get than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5825.729s">[Knight]</a>: Um, that action took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5827.251s">[Knight]</a>: It hasn't been undone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5829.073s">[Knight]</a>: That action hasn't been undone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5830.454s">[Knight]</a>: So just because there's been turnover on the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5833.123s">[Knight]</a>: doesn't mean that the action's undone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5834.745s">[Knight]</a>: That's like saying, because we passed an ordinance five years ago and the body's changed, the ordinance doesn't count anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5839.952s">[Knight]</a>: That's not the way it works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5841.334s">[Knight]</a>: The body acted, the body passed it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5843.056s">[Knight]</a>: That was the legislative intent at the time, and that should carry through until it's changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5872.185s">[Knight]</a>: Because the Zoning Board of Appeals doesn't create public policy, they execute it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5875.81s">[Knight]</a>: The Medford City Council creates and establishes public policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5878.914s">[Knight]</a>: That policy's been established and the Zoning Board of Appeals is using their discretion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5882.625s">[Knight]</a>: to say, no, you can't bring an application before us when they can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5888.467s">[Knight]</a>: Are they a violation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5890.788s">[Knight]</a>: I think that the Zoning Board of Appeals made an error, an error in judgment that's opened the city up to liabilities by refusing to hear an application for an individual that's applied for a use variance based upon the legislative history and the solicitor's opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5902.353s">[Knight]</a>: Yes, I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5903.153s">[Knight]</a>: I feel as though they made an error.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5904.493s">[Knight]</a>: And that's why I put this resolution forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5906.074s">[Knight]</a>: And that's why I took the time to research the legislative history so that we'd all understand that this is how it went down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5948.515s">[Knight]</a>: Yes, it clarified the situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5950.556s">[Knight]</a>: The solicitor gave us an opinion that said that there was a scrivener's error in the codification of the ordinances that happened in 2001.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5956.559s">[Knight]</a>: The city solicitor has produced a document from August 12, 2016 that includes history of his research.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5964.79s">[Knight]</a>: Part of that history is an email exchange between the solicitor and the MuniCode company that we use to codify our ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5973.173s">[Knight]</a>: And if you go through that email, you can see the history and the back and forth, MuniCode even saying that it's an error, that use variances are allowed and never should have been changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5983.116s">[Knight]</a>: So there's plenty of documentation backing up the fact that the codified ordinances that were done in 2001 contained a Scribner's error relative to use variances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5992.819s">[Knight]</a>: We asked for clarification, we got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5995.802s">[Knight]</a>: We've adopted the clarification as law in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6026.014s">[Knight]</a>: I just want to make sure, Mr. Not taken that way at all, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6104.15s">[Knight]</a>: No, it's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6105.751s">[Knight]</a>: We've actually moved to correct the language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6108.652s">[Knight]</a>: However, the codification last occurred in 2001.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6112.974s">[Knight]</a>: Based upon the meeting that we had just an hour or two ago, the next step that this council is going to take going forward with our zoning reform would be a recodification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6122.099s">[Knight]</a>: At that time, I think that this error would be addressed anyhow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6125.736s">[Knight]</a>: However, in the meantime, we have applicants that are applying for use variances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6129.8s">[Knight]</a>: They're not given their day in court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6131.341s">[Knight]</a>: They deserve the right to a hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6132.602s">[Knight]</a>: Whether they get denied or not, they shouldn't be told they can't apply and that they can't present their case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6136.565s">[Knight]</a>: They should be given the opportunity to present their case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6142.37s">[Knight]</a>: Well, it's up to the Zoning Board of Appeals insofar as whether or not they have the authority to issue the use variance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6147.805s">[Knight]</a>: With the zoning board saying we don't have the authority to issue the use variance if we had the legislative body is saying no you do Because our legislative history and the intent of the acts they should do there's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6165.189s">[Knight]</a>: By way of the vote on paper 1 8 3 7 6 we addressed it those we addressed those two conflicting sections We adopted the list of his opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6173.13s">[Knight]</a>: There's no longer two conflicting sections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6291.378s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, based upon the conversations that we had last Wednesday evening, the financial picture in this community is grim.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6299.22s">[Knight]</a>: I think it's incumbent upon us as city councilors to make sure that we are informed as best we can be when it comes down to the current financial circumstances that are facing this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6310.182s">[Knight]</a>: We've seen our private outside<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6312.981s">[Knight]</a>: can help you get revenue forecasts of what to expect for the next fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6317.523s">[Knight]</a>: One of those things is an $8 million budget shortfall at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6321.865s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, I put several resolutions on this evening on similar subject matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6326.847s">[Knight]</a>: And what they are is to get information to this council so that we can sit back and begin to craft an informed decision that we need to make on whether or not we're going to pass a budget this year and what that budget is going to include.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6339.063s">[Knight]</a>: On top of that, Mr. President, we need to take a look at certain aspects of our service delivery and identify what's important and essential to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6345.931s">[Knight]</a>: And I think that based upon the circumstances that we've all faced, no one can shake a stick at the fact that our public safety personnel are going above and beyond during these trying times right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6355.503s">[Knight]</a>: They're essential workers that have been out there on the front lines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6358.833s">[Knight]</a>: So, I'd just like to see what it is our current staffing levels are, our budgeted staffing levels are, and our minimum staffing levels are to ensure that as we move forward and we face these trying fiscal times, that we do our best to secure as many positions as we can in the public safety realm so that moving forward, we know that the residents in this community are protected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6377.758s">[Knight]</a>: I think that, you know, we've all said it before, the number one priority and the number one goal and objective as an elected official in this community is making sure our streets are safe and our community is safe, and we can't do that without<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6387.441s">[Knight]</a>: public safety personnel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6389.322s">[Knight]</a>: I ask my council colleagues to support the results.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6397.647s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I would say paper 20345, paper 20346, paper 20350, and paper 20351 are all of similar subject matter and can be consolidated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6414.608s">[Knight]</a>: I'd ask that you wait for read paper 20350 last Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6489.084s">[Knight]</a>: When we go back to last Wednesday evening's meeting and we met with our private outside consultant responsible for auditing here in the city of Medford, he also provided us with some revenue forecasts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6501.933s">[Knight]</a>: And I was very impressed with the presentation and the level of preparedness that Mr. Roselli brought to the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6508.978s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, one of the things that he said that I took away that evening was that he is confident that we can start a budget discussion by<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6517.688s">[Knight]</a>: June 1st and have a budget by June 30th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6521.409s">[Knight]</a>: He's given us revenue forecasts that are very conservative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6524.95s">[Knight]</a>: And moving forward, I think it's important that we work as hard as we can to put together an annual fiscal year budget, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6534.713s">[Knight]</a>: I know there's been a lot of talk about a one-twelfths budget or a quarterly budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6539.815s">[Knight]</a>: And I don't think that that's the way to go, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6542.516s">[Knight]</a>: In these discussions that we had on Wednesday evening, we talked about what approach we were going to take.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6548.258s">[Knight]</a>: And there's a question as to whether or not we want to take a wait-and-see approach Wait and see if we're going to get bailed out by the federal government wait and see if we're going to get bailed out by the state government We have revenue projections from private outside consultants that we're paying money to to give us revenue projections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6562.527s">[Knight]</a>: We have them I feel as though it's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6564.888s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President that we take the bull by the horns That we move forward and we control our own destiny and don't wait for a bailout<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6573.314s">[Knight]</a>: If, in fact, we're going to be facing trying fiscal times, then we need to take the bull by the horns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6579.298s">[Knight]</a>: We need to do things the Medford way, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6581.9s">[Knight]</a>: And sitting back and playing the wait and see who's going to bail us out approach is not the Medford way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6588.404s">[Knight]</a>: If that were the Medford way, Mr. President, we wouldn't have been the first community in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to have a transit-oriented smock growth development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6598.353s">[Knight]</a>: If waiting to be bailed out was the method way, Mr. President, then we certainly wouldn't have been able to purchase the grounds where Homel Stadium is for $1 and a land transfer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6608.857s">[Knight]</a>: If waiting to be bailed out was the method way, Mr. President, then we wouldn't have been able to get our applications in early enough to get a 90% reimbursement on the construction of our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6618.342s">[Knight]</a>: If waiting to be bailed out was the method way, Mr. President, then we wouldn't have been the first community in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to establish a linkage fee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6627.273s">[Knight]</a>: So I think, Mr. President, as we move forward, what we need to do is put together a budget, a 12-month annual budget, where we make hard decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6635.997s">[Knight]</a>: God forbid we have to go forward with those projections that have been presented to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6641.139s">[Knight]</a>: God forbid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6642.179s">[Knight]</a>: Because there's going to be a lot of cuts, and those cuts are going to cut deep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6645.761s">[Knight]</a>: But we have revenue forecasts right now that give us a worst-case scenario.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6650.643s">[Knight]</a>: So we should be putting together an annual budget based upon the worst-case scenario.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6654.733s">[Knight]</a>: If, in fact, our funding comes back from the feds or the states better than we anticipated, then we have an influx of cash and we'll be able to fill the gaps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6662.418s">[Knight]</a>: On Wednesday night, we did have a significant discussion relative to where the administration is in the preparation of their budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6669.963s">[Knight]</a>: COVID-19 caused the government shutdown beginning on the 13th of March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6675.888s">[Knight]</a>: We were scheduled to meet the first week in April on the budget, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6679.77s">[Knight]</a>: That was two weeks before the government shutdown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6683.136s">[Knight]</a>: I doubt the administration was going to be able to put together an entire budget in two weeks, which would lead us all to believe that there was some work being done in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6690.318s">[Knight]</a>: The city administration has actually confirmed that every single department in the city has presented the administration with their working fiscal year 21 budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6701.582s">[Knight]</a>: These documents have not been consolidated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6704.683s">[Knight]</a>: There is going to be a need for trimming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6707.144s">[Knight]</a>: Obviously, there are many competing needs in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6710.427s">[Knight]</a>: But we're at the spot right now where we have worst case scenario revenue forecasts, and we have a budget based upon the projections prior to COVID-19.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6719.61s">[Knight]</a>: I think we all want to deliver services at or better than the level that we're at today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6726.772s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, we have a budget that will allow us to do that, that hasn't been consolidated, but East Montgomery has presented that to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6733.894s">[Knight]</a>: And we have forecasts, what the money is going to be from our private outside consultants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6738.442s">[Knight]</a>: So I think, Mr. President, we're in a position where we can put together a 12-month annual budget for the upcoming fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6744.15s">[Knight]</a>: It might not be a pretty budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6745.652s">[Knight]</a>: It's going to be something that might require some tough decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6750.018s">[Knight]</a>: But at the end of the day, like Councilor Mack said, a budget's made up of 85% salaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6755.563s">[Knight]</a>: So cutting a couple of water coolers isn't going to cut the mustard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6758.244s">[Knight]</a>: We have $8 million to fill, and we've got to start doing it now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6761.905s">[Knight]</a>: And sitting back and waiting to be bailed out by the Feds is not the measured way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6765.426s">[Knight]</a>: If it were, we wouldn't have seen the successes that we've seen in the past, and we wouldn't have been able to weather the terrible fiscal times that we've seen in the past, like back in 2008.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6773.137s">[Knight]</a>: Quite frankly, here we are 12 years later, we really haven't recovered from the 2008 cuts that have been made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6778.241s">[Knight]</a>: Look at our DPW and the staffing levels there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6780.643s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, we need a 12 month budget moving forward for fiscal year 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6786.148s">[Knight]</a>: And I asked my council colleagues to support this consolidated amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6790.451s">[Knight]</a>: And moving forward, I look forward to working with them to solve some of these fiscal concerns that we have here in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7149.201s">[Knight]</a>: I certainly agree with certain aspects of what Councilor Marks said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7152.722s">[Knight]</a>: One of them being we need to see what the administration's working on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7155.865s">[Knight]</a>: And at Wednesday night's meeting, that's why I requested that the administration provide us with the copies of those departmental budgets that they've received thus far, so that we can see how far along in the process they are in establishing a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7169.87s">[Knight]</a>: Ultimately, Mr. President, general law would say that the administration is required to present the council with a budget by the 170th day after the organization of government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7180.194s">[Knight]</a>: So if you see that we have an inauguration,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7185.799s">[Knight]</a>: Administration, 170 days, budget to the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7188.92s">[Knight]</a>: That's what the division of local services, state law says surrounding this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7193.021s">[Knight]</a>: So, you know, while the council doesn't necessarily get involved in producing a budget, if in fact we don't receive a budget by the 170th day, by law, we have the right to establish our own budget and put our own budget together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7204.325s">[Knight]</a>: We've never done that before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7205.826s">[Knight]</a>: We've never done that before in the history of the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7208.646s">[Knight]</a>: Never done it before, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7211.479s">[Knight]</a>: Difficult times call for difficult measures and drastic times call for drastic measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7215.022s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not recommending that the council put forward its own budget and send it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7218.686s">[Knight]</a>: What I am saying is that we need to be on the same page moving forward and then we have to have an expectation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7223.99s">[Knight]</a>: And that expectation should be that we have an annual budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7667.788s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, I understand where council of business is coming from because ultimately taxpayers in this community deserve to have services and service delivery is what we're here to perform.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7677.632s">[Knight]</a>: But at the same time, borrowing our way out of a financial situation and creating a structural deficit, not only for this upcoming fiscal year, but for fiscal years in the future and establishing a bonded debt for us to pay down for operating costs is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7695.08s">[Knight]</a>: That's scary to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7696.941s">[Knight]</a>: That's really creating a structural deficit and relying on reserves or borrowing in order for us to operate our government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7703.125s">[Knight]</a>: Granted, like you said, 100 years, Great Depression, one out of every five people is unemployed in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7710.129s">[Knight]</a>: Actually, in the nation right now, one in every five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7713.031s">[Knight]</a>: When you look at it, you can't close the door, but we also have to be very cautious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7718.154s">[Knight]</a>: We can't borrow and spend out, borrow and deplete our reserves in order for us to get<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7723.257s">[Knight]</a>: the situation, the financial situations, the financial situation, the numbers of the numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7728.439s">[Knight]</a>: So I commend the Council of thinking of outside the box solutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7733.581s">[Knight]</a>: However, borrowing our way out of a structural deficit, I think is something that's scary to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7739.924s">[Knight]</a>: But I rest with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8208.567s">[Knight]</a>: No one's asking for a wish list budget from the department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8211.968s">[Knight]</a>: What was represented at Wednesday night's meeting last week was that, I believe the quote from the chief of staff was that we have a fiscal year 21 working budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8224.667s">[Knight]</a>: It's not a wishlist budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8225.928s">[Knight]</a>: It's a fiscal year 21 working budget based upon the revenue forecast at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8234.711s">[Knight]</a>: So, you know, it's not a wishlist budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8238.513s">[Knight]</a>: Now, this coupled with the fact that, I mean, I can go back now, I've done several budgets and going back to Councilor Penta asking for wishlist budgets every single year is a resolution for a time that I was on the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8252.019s">[Knight]</a>: I recall these requests have been made in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8254.967s">[Knight]</a>: Um, but I'm not asking for a wishlist budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8257.092s">[Knight]</a>: I'm asking for the budget that was prepared for the working budget that was prepared for FY 15 based upon the government shutdown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8265.184s">[Knight]</a>: So just to clarify that point, I apologize for the family interference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8312.757s">[Knight]</a>: that he said, I don't think this information will be helpful to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8317.218s">[Knight]</a>: And as the person that has to make the decision, I think it would be very helpful to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8321.499s">[Knight]</a>: But again, we never requested a wishlist budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8324.539s">[Knight]</a>: The question was asked to the mayor, where are you in the process right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8327.68s">[Knight]</a>: Government shutdown happened on or around 3-13.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8330.401s">[Knight]</a>: Two weeks, we've been April 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8332.941s">[Knight]</a>: We were scheduled to start our meetings on April 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8334.881s">[Knight]</a>: So where are we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8335.982s">[Knight]</a>: And she said, all the departments have submitted their budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8339.962s">[Knight]</a>: I haven't had a chance to review them and consolidate them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8343.01s">[Knight]</a>: Okay, fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8344.771s">[Knight]</a>: I said, so we have a wishlist budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8347.292s">[Knight]</a>: That was a quote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8348.073s">[Knight]</a>: So we have a wishlist budget for each department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8350.074s">[Knight]</a>: At which time the chief of staff said, no, we do not have a wishlist budget for each department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8354.776s">[Knight]</a>: We have a fiscal year 21 working budget for those departments based upon the forecast prior to COVID-19.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8363.56s">[Knight]</a>: So this isn't a request for wishlist budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8365.301s">[Knight]</a>: This is a request for the budget, the budget that was prepared by the department heads and should COVID-19 not have happened,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8371.26s">[Knight]</a>: we would see where we are absent the crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8373.221s">[Knight]</a>: Now we have the, so we'll have a budget here that says, you know, in a perfect world without COVID-19, this is what we needed to meet our goals and objectives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8380.526s">[Knight]</a>: Here we are with the revenue forecast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8383.208s">[Knight]</a>: Here's the budget based upon these revenue forecasts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8385.61s">[Knight]</a>: These are the gaps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8386.91s">[Knight]</a>: How are we going to fill them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8431.229s">[Knight]</a>: I can read it, but I can't move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8433.411s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, there was a motion made to consolidate the papers to one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8437.994s">[Knight]</a>: With paper 350 controlling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8441.517s">[Knight]</a>: So it would be paper 20-350, and then the other papers underneath it, all financial matters, all requesting information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8714.213s">[Knight]</a>: Um, I do believe in recent weeks, Mr. President, the council also put forward a paper requesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8745.771s">[Knight]</a>: Yeah, just a few weeks ago we requested an update relative to the runoff issues in front of Citizens Bank as it related to that project as well and I'd just like to reiterate that request as part of this result.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8759.315s">[Knight]</a>: It doesn't have to be an amendment I just think that you know it's a request that's been made so if we can just send them the previous document that was approved by the council again because we haven't gotten an update that would be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8960.147s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8962.189s">[Knight]</a>: First and foremost, I'd like to commend Kevin Bailey and Danny Folk on the work they're doing during these trying times in the recreation department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8970.694s">[Knight]</a>: It's very difficult to establish recreational programming when you can't have anybody in the same place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8976.711s">[Knight]</a>: And they've been doing a great job pursuing various aspects of socially distance and online recreational opportunities for individuals in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8985.935s">[Knight]</a>: And I'm hoping that we can make a few suggestions to the gentlemen in the recreation department moving forward to implement for the betterment of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8994.8s">[Knight]</a>: I think that, you know, here we are approaching day 60.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8998.534s">[Knight]</a>: Many of us are getting stir-crazy with, you know, being trapped in the house and in the backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9003.438s">[Knight]</a>: There's not much opportunity for us to go out and pursue recreational opportunities that aren't passive in nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9010.764s">[Knight]</a>: And we've seen a lot of work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9014.307s">[Knight]</a>: take place to bring some of these services online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9018.209s">[Knight]</a>: And it's been met with a measure of success.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9020.811s">[Knight]</a>: It's been met with certainly some enthusiasm in the community, and I'm hoping that we can take this momentum and build upon it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9028.535s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, I commend<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9031.056s">[Knight]</a>: the efforts of the recreation department and the work that they're doing and thinking out of the box to bring services to the residents in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9038.359s">[Knight]</a>: And because they're doing it in a virtual setting, they're able to do it in a way that's at a significantly low cost to the taxpayer and the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9063.268s">[Knight]</a>: Celebrate a birthday party, birthday but can't have a party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9066.31s">[Knight]</a>: Stuff like that, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9067.651s">[Knight]</a>: So I'm hoping that my council colleagues will support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9072.294s">[Knight]</a>: Once again, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9072.895s">[Knight]</a>: Once again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9073.415s">[Knight]</a>: I got to call the governor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9074.696s">[Knight]</a>: I want to see if he can lend me his guy, just in case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9666.49s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I also raise the question, if in fact, you know, we had a 10-year trash contract that was extended for the period of time, when was it that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9678.342s">[Knight]</a>: The other condo associations in this community have been contacted relative to whether or not these bulk pickup and recycling services are available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9686.525s">[Knight]</a>: If they refused these services 15 years ago and they haven't been asked again, I think that will be problematic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9693.088s">[Knight]</a>: The taxpaying residents in this community, they should have access to the services that are provided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9697.85s">[Knight]</a>: So just because they've opted out at one point in time, I guess the question is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9702.278s">[Knight]</a>: To what frequency is the city requesting or monitoring this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9705.523s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, the contract's a 10-year contract, so would it be, you know, they don't come back and ask for 10 years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9715.416s">[Knight]</a>: It's all by request?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9719.995s">[Knight]</a>: So it might make sense then for the DPW to do an outreach if in fact I'm gonna get a Maple Park, which I support wholeheartedly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9728.382s">[Knight]</a>: The question is, you know, do we make sure that everybody understands that they have the option to do this and extend to them the same olive branch that we're extending Maple Park or the same courtesy that we're extending Maple Park to be sure that they're aware that they have access to these services if they've in fact denied them previously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=10301.098s">[Knight]</a>: Also, Mr. President, yesterday, there was a tragic fire on Canal Street in West Medford, and a number of families have been displaced from this fire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=10313.302s">[Knight]</a>: So I'd ask that the city administration and the school department<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=10317.439s">[Knight]</a>: report back to the council as to what steps are being taken to help these families out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=10321.622s">[Knight]</a>: It's my understanding that we've seen GoFundMe pages that have been created and stuff like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=10329.327s">[Knight]</a>: But in times like this, the community needs to come together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=10332.889s">[Knight]</a>: So I'm hoping that if there's an action plan or if there's any resources available to these families that we'd be provided with notice so that we can take the appropriate steps to help out in any way that we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=77.0s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much and I know that you and I was supposed to be co sponsors on this I apologize for leaving you off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=82.988s">[Knight]</a>: I know that you and I spoke about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=86.751s">[Knight]</a>: But it's the Sobato family are owners and operators of Expressos pizzeria on Boston Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=90.854s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, but just that just closed very recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=94.336s">[Knight]</a>: And for 40 years they operated at that corner and they were one of the first businesses in this community to get an extended hours license.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=101.661s">[Knight]</a>: And they really set a trend up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=102.962s">[Knight]</a>: They serviced my neighborhood that I grew up in, as well as I'm sure Councilor Collins will tell us, Tufts University population for a great deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=109.868s">[Knight]</a>: But they've always been a great neighbor and a great partner in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=112.57s">[Knight]</a>: And after 40 years, they're hanging up the aprons and the pizza wheel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=115.892s">[Knight]</a>: So I think it goes without saying that they deserve some recognition for the community building that they did here in this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=121.756s">[Knight]</a>: And they've offered this community, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=124.118s">[Knight]</a>: They're great people, a great family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=125.519s">[Knight]</a>: I had the opportunity to grow up with some nephews, some of our nephews in the Davises as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=130.042s">[Knight]</a>: great kids, great people, all giving to this community now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=133.363s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to support this resolution and send it to the administration for the request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=174.104s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=267.997s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=268.778s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=270.139s">[Knight]</a>: I've gotten a number of complaints recently from members of the community seeking copies of minutes or copies of meetings related to especially the Cannabis Advisory Commission as well as the Historic Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=281.589s">[Knight]</a>: And these documents or records are not available readily on the website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=284.972s">[Knight]</a>: So after multiple calls, I thought it might make sense for us to reach out to the administration and ask them to take the appropriate steps to ensure that this material gets posted publicly and transparently, and that the council take the appropriate steps to ensure that this is a standard and a norm, not an anomaly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=357.152s">[Knight]</a>: We certainly have no problem with that, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=414.758s">[Knight]</a>: Council night, Mister President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=417.299s">[Knight]</a>: Yes, yet again, a nice personnel issue has made its way to the newspaper that's identified a number of issues that are going on here at City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=424.862s">[Knight]</a>: One of those issues, I believe, would be an IP vulnerability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=427.883s">[Knight]</a>: It's my understanding that our IT director, after 24 years of employment in the city of Medford with an exemplary record, was removed from his position based upon some certain IT vulnerabilities that the council has not been made aware of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=440.287s">[Knight]</a>: This is very concerning to me, Mr. President, because of their IT vulnerabilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=445.272s">[Knight]</a>: Similar to what we saw in the past, the administration wouldn't disclose to us when the number of personal information was taken from the city website maybe nine or 10 months ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=453.919s">[Knight]</a>: It just raises cause for concern, number one, and it also raises cause for liability for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=461.805s">[Knight]</a>: And if there's going to be a liability that's placed upon the city, it's going to end up costing the city money, and the council should know about it, because we're the steward of the taxpayer dollar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=469.193s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd ask that this motion to move forward that we set up an executive session with the city administration for us to discuss these it vulnerabilities to see what steps we need to take to ensure that the personal information and data of the taxpayers in this community is protected appropriately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=483.662s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=563.501s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=565.001s">[Knight]</a>: Litigation and representation has been the topic of discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=568.962s">[Knight]</a>: Most of those terms so far, Mr. President, for the last four or five weeks, that's all we've been talking about is litigation and representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=575.425s">[Knight]</a>: And recently, this council passed a money bill to amend the fiscal year budget to allow the mayor's private legal counsel to really have an open checkbook for litigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=590.023s">[Knight]</a>: And when we look at what's going on here in the community and you think about the litigation that's pending,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=594.426s">[Knight]</a>: and the amount of money that's been appropriated, and whether or not that amount of money is going to be able to stretch to cover the issues that are in dispute right now, it raises some concern for me financially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=604.951s">[Knight]</a>: So when you think about the more than 25 labor charges that are against the city right now, when you think about the 340 developments that the city's fighting right now, that doesn't look like we're fighting a winning battle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=616.936s">[Knight]</a>: When you look at the potential<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=619.552s">[Knight]</a>: issue with the cannabis advisory commission in the conflict of interest concerning one of the members of the selection committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=626.135s">[Knight]</a>: It just puts me in a position as the president to sit here and think about what we're doing with our money and whether or not we should be planning appropriately for future spending.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=636.38s">[Knight]</a>: You know since this term started I think we've spent a lot of dough in 4 or 5 weeks and I'm hoping that you know we can kind of responsibly manage<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=649.048s">[Knight]</a>: our budgets, our plans, our finances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=651.829s">[Knight]</a>: And I think that by establishing a subcommittee on litigation, that will give the council a better idea going forward as to what steps we need to take to fund the law department in an appropriate fashion to ensure that we secure our legal representation moving forward, to be sure that we secure our zoning consultant moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=668.675s">[Knight]</a>: So I think that this will help us address a number of the concerns and issues that we've raised, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=672.276s">[Knight]</a>: May I ask for my council colleagues' support?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=707.612s">[Knight]</a>: If I'm with me, I know that the president's strong pencil also has the power to strike and create the subcommittees as we discussed at the beginning of the session, but I personally have no objections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=719.156s">[Knight]</a>: What direction this council chooses to go with that direction, I want to go for transparency purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=723.578s">[Knight]</a>: So be it, I have no problem with that whatsoever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=808.971s">[Knight]</a>: Paper 22054 offered by Councilor Caraviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=812.793s">[Knight]</a>: Be it resolved the Medford City Council will have the mayor start looking into purchasing vehicles for the Medford Police Department, most patrol cars are now four plus years old with high mileage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=820.656s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Caraviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1357.898s">[Knight]</a>: seven the affirmative zero and the negative the motion passes Council paper to to 055 offered by Councilor Caraviello be resolved the city council request the administration please provide the council with the findings of its review of the clerk's office along with all legal costs associated Councilor caveat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1570.95s">[Knight]</a>: Oh, this is an appropriation request that I support wholeheartedly I certainly have no problem with the appropriations that are requested here by the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1579.253s">[Knight]</a>: In particular, the walking clock project, I think we're very lucky to have Jeffrey Driscoll running the Metro Housing Authority, the premier housing authority director in the state of Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1587.956s">[Knight]</a>: He's the housing authority director that trains the other housing authority directors across the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1592.737s">[Knight]</a>: He's done an excellent job he's really.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1595.936s">[Knight]</a>: moved our housing authority forward, very similar to the way that Mike Durham has moved that veterans office forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1600.937s">[Knight]</a>: He's done a great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1602.197s">[Knight]</a>: And I've been looking at this request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1603.918s">[Knight]</a>: I think this is what the CPA is really intended for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1607.738s">[Knight]</a>: It's a perfect use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1609.119s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, I support it wholeheartedly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1611.339s">[Knight]</a>: In terms of the Riverbed Park project and the accessibility improvements to Chevallier Auditorium, again, two items that we've been talking about for a long time, two things that I think are important to this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1622.501s">[Knight]</a>: So without being said, I'd move for approval on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=354.395s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=356.217s">[Knight]</a>: As we're all aware, I think that it's safe to say the streets in the city of Medford are in some pretty bad condition, probably the worst we've seen in a bit of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=363.741s">[Knight]</a>: And with that being said, we have to start somewhere, Mr. President, to determine how we're going to address the road surfaces in this community, the streets, the roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=372.948s">[Knight]</a>: And in looking at certain areas in the community, I feel as though there are thoroughfares that are labeled emergency thoroughfares.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=380.754s">[Knight]</a>: I think the meeting before this, they talked a lot about priority sidewalks and emergency roadways and connectivity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=386.918s">[Knight]</a>: And I think it's very important, Mr. President, that we look at our emergency arteries as the main roadways here in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=393.001s">[Knight]</a>: The stretch of Boston Avenue being one of those emergency arteries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=397.143s">[Knight]</a>: And looking at what it's going to cost and what we need to do to begin to get a roadway resurfacing plan in place, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=403.366s">[Knight]</a>: So I bring this paper forward to start a discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=406.768s">[Knight]</a>: about what it's going to take and what it's going to cost for us to start providing services in the form of local services, like sidewalks, streets, stumps, tree removal, and the like, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=417.315s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, I offer this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=418.896s">[Knight]</a>: I ask my council colleagues to support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=822.224s">[Knight]</a>: Motion to adopt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=824.195s">[Knight]</a>: the provisions of general law chapter 64 and section three and impose a local excise tax on the sale or transfer of marijuana products for adult use to anyone other than a marijuana establishment at a rate of 3%, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=835.783s">[Knight]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1007.529s">[Knight]</a>: I did, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1009.781s">[Knight]</a>: I do believe that this council during budget time requested that we'd have a quarterly meeting relative to where we were with forecasts and receipts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1018.523s">[Knight]</a>: And then the council did vote on a resolution asking that this meeting take place relative to the state of the city's finances for the second Tuesday in October.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1029.385s">[Knight]</a>: That never happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1031.465s">[Knight]</a>: And here we are this evening with a request for appropriation before us, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1035.727s">[Knight]</a>: So, you know, I know that these funds are through the surcharges around those Uber and Lyft rides that originate in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1042.377s">[Knight]</a>: And looking at the appendix that's attached, I certainly see no issue with the appropriations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1048.605s">[Knight]</a>: I'd like to see them maybe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1050.256s">[Knight]</a>: distributed a little bit more equitably across the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1054.379s">[Knight]</a>: However, I feel as though it's important, Mr. President, that we sit down and schedule a time for us to talk about the state of our finances here in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1063.145s">[Knight]</a>: During the budget, we were talking about a fiscal crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1067.188s">[Knight]</a>: We took $5.5 million from our reserves and we appropriated that much money from our reserves to balance the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1073.673s">[Knight]</a>: The question is, are we doing better now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1076.698s">[Knight]</a>: Do we have the ability to restore some of those funds back to our reserves if our forecasts are showing that our receipts are up well above anticipated returns?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1085.635s">[Knight]</a>: So Mr. President, it was very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1088.191s">[Knight]</a>: discussion that took place during the budget, and this was one of the items that came out of that, was that we'd meet quarterly to determine what the current and ongoing state of fiscal affairs is in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1098.358s">[Knight]</a>: And that needs to happen, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1100.44s">[Knight]</a>: And we have a paper before us asking us to appropriate $136,000, but we still haven't had that meeting to recap the last quarter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1108.425s">[Knight]</a>: So that's concerning to me, Mr. President, and I'm hoping that the finance director would be able to coordinate with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1115.87s">[Knight]</a>: to determine a time where we'll be able to do that before the next quarter is over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1119.994s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, here we are almost one month into the next quarter, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1125.098s">[Knight]</a>: So we're going to get a skewed perspective of what's going on if we don't meet as close to the close of the quarter as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1133.444s">[Knight]</a>: So I'd ask that that meeting be scheduled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1141.951s">[Knight]</a>: I did want it during the regular session, yes, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1146.636s">[Knight]</a>: If this was a free cash appropriation, I'd be much more concerned about taking a vote this evening on it, but where it's coming from a dedicated accountant that has a dedicated purpose, that's another thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1158.383s">[Knight]</a>: So that being said, Mr. President, this will be the last money paper I vote on until we have that quarterly meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1165.688s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, I rest my case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3306.166s">[Knight]</a>: Move approval, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3440.982s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3442.824s">[Knight]</a>: It's with a heavy heart that I offer this resolution this evening, offering condolences to the family of William J. Gay on his recent passing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3450.808s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. Gay was a long time resident down on Elmhurst Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3454.05s">[Knight]</a>: World War II veteran and a proud father, grandfather, and husband, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3458.793s">[Knight]</a>: And he was recently called to his maker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3462.015s">[Knight]</a>: And I'd like to extend my deep and sincere condolences to the Gay family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3465.817s">[Knight]</a>: And I'd like to ask my council colleagues to join me in offering such.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3656.912s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3658.012s">[Knight]</a>: Yes, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3659.513s">[Knight]</a>: Noah started this, and you gotta keep in mind now, Noah's what, 20 years old?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3665.375s">[Knight]</a>: Three, four years ago, he started this mission where he began collecting World War II artifacts, World War II uniforms and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3675.859s">[Knight]</a>: And that morphed into this veteran's preservation project where Noah goes,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3681.241s">[Knight]</a>: all across Massachusetts, all across New England, showing off his wares at various town hall meetings, veterans meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3689.529s">[Knight]</a>: Along with the artifacts that he has, he also has many stories that go along with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3695.634s">[Knight]</a>: And it's just very impressive, Mr. President, that a kid at such a young age has shown such a commitment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3701.9s">[Knight]</a>: to furthering the memory of veterans here in Massachusetts, in Medford, and beyond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3708.866s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, I do think it might make sense for us to invite Noah down and honor him with a citation based upon the success of the Veterans Preservation Project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3720.155s">[Knight]</a>: And I'd offer that in full of a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=99.433s">[Knight]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=133.539s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I move to take paper 2013 out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=137.261s">[Knight]</a>: This was a paper that was before the council previously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=139.383s">[Knight]</a>: We sent it back to the mayor with a request for amendment and it has come back as<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=144.315s">[Knight]</a>: The council amended it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=145.075s">[Knight]</a>: I'd like to ask a representative from the administration to come up and just give us a brief synopsis of the paper that's before us, and then hopefully move for a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=180.035s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I do believe, Mr. President, that the special revenue fund was a recommendation that was made by the Division of Local Services from the Department of Revenue to establish generally accepted accounting practices on how to spend the funds that come with these host community agreements and community impact agreements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=195.918s">[Knight]</a>: Based upon the language that's been provided to us and the review of the language that's been provided to us previously, it seems as though everything's in order and the recommendations of the council have been adopted by the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=204.839s">[Knight]</a>: As such, I'd move for approval of the paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=209.284s">[Knight]</a>: On the motion of- No, no, it's actually a home rule petition, it's going to the legislature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=214.386s">[Knight]</a>: It's a home rule petition, so it will go to the legislature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=266.21s">[Knight]</a>: Yes, we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=267.091s">[Knight]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1516.658s">[Knight]</a>: restricted available funds used to supplement the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1520.641s">[Knight]</a>: By definition that's what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1524.663s">[Knight]</a>: Motion to receive and place on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2010.135s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2011.476s">[Knight]</a>: Last term when this council did adopt the increase from $20,000 to $40,000, which passed unanimously before the body, we raised a question to the city assessor asking her to conduct a cost analysis and feasibility study of adopting the state maximum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2028.242s">[Knight]</a>: She reported back to us, I believe, right around the time we were setting the tax rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2033.517s">[Knight]</a>: that she was still working on that document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2036.1s">[Knight]</a>: So I'd just like to add the paper that the council had adopted back in March of 2019, I'm sorry, May of 2019, I believe it was either the 20th or the 28th in that meeting, making that request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2048.192s">[Knight]</a>: And add that to the agenda as part of the discussion, Mr. President, because if we're going to make a decision about this type of issue that's going to have a certain impact on our finances here in the community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2058.48s">[Knight]</a>: then at the very least we need to have a feasibility study or a cost impact analysis done so that we have an understanding of what impact it's going to have on the bottom line in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2069.164s">[Knight]</a>: So my motion would be to join that paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2074.086s">[Knight]</a>: To include it as part of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2075.386s">[Knight]</a>: It doesn't necessarily have to be joined to this paper tonight, but when the meeting is conducted, that it's conducted when we have the cost analysis and feasibility study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4193.481s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I believe it was early in December that we were up here singing Rosemary praises for her recent achievement being named Medford's 2019 Citizen of the Year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4202.814s">[Knight]</a>: And as such, just recently, at the end of this month, earlier this month, she celebrated a very momentous birthday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4209.661s">[Knight]</a>: So it's been quite a year for Rosemary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4211.623s">[Knight]</a>: She became a citizen of the year and an octogenarian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4214.487s">[Knight]</a>: I'd like to wish her a very happy 80th birthday and ask my council colleagues to join her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4429.646s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4431.808s">[Knight]</a>: Paper 17321 was introduced in 2017 before the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4436.312s">[Knight]</a>: It had gone through a subcommittee process and was a paper that was reported out favorably by the subcommittee on ordinances, I do believe, and then was never scheduled for a committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4446.241s">[Knight]</a>: And that was a paper that was also designed to regulate drop boxes here in the community of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4451.665s">[Knight]</a>: During the deliberations and discussions of this issue, one thing came up that was very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4457.43s">[Knight]</a>: We have a textile recycling fundraising program at our elementary schools and our middle schools and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4467.352s">[Knight]</a>: facilities exemption was something that was very important at the time, and I'm sure that still holds true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4472.934s">[Knight]</a>: So moving forward, if we're going to regulate donation drop boxes by way of ordinance, I'd just like to request that school and city facilities be excluded from the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4489.701s">[Knight]</a>: That would be an amendment to the main paper, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5380.06s">[Knight]</a>: Point of information, Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5382.502s">[Knight]</a>: I think it's important to point out that this council sued the Board of Appeals relative to that decision that they made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5387.086s">[Knight]</a>: We took this case to court and we lost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5388.608s">[Knight]</a>: We were found to not have standing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5409.175s">[Knight]</a>: The Medford City Council filed suit and was thrown out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5412.638s">[Knight]</a>: And the land court judge had found the city legislative body had zero standing to appeal the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5428.791s">[Knight]</a>: We got thrown out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5432.153s">[Knight]</a>: We spent $60,000 to be told we didn't have standing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5437.601s">[Knight]</a>: Then the question was, are we going to spend another 60 grand to be told that again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5441.667s">[Knight]</a>: But I rest my case, but I just wanted to point out the factual history of the process and what went down with Locust Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5447.449s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you, Councilman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5448.35s">[Knight]</a>: We weren't sitting back on our hands saying, oh, Locust Street's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5451.191s">[Knight]</a>: That's not what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5451.891s">[Knight]</a>: We sued the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5452.631s">[Knight]</a>: We sued the zoning board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5477.739s">[Knight]</a>: I believe it was 40, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5479.14s">[Knight]</a>: And we weren't, we weren't, we weren't, uh, you know, co-defendants or co-appellants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5483.962s">[Knight]</a>: We were an individual entity that moved forward as a, in a silo, not with the neighborhood, not with anybody else, but we're in the best interest of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5828.88s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I support the resolution wholeheartedly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5830.921s">[Knight]</a>: I do think it's important to point out that if the council does have in fact legal counsel to provide it with legal opinions, the legal opinions relative to ethics and the like would have to come from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5842.648s">[Knight]</a>: Statutorily, the city solicitor's office, we can't have our own council giving us opinions related to that, but we can use this person for the very important job of drafting framework ordinances, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5852.63s">[Knight]</a>: That's something we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5853.971s">[Knight]</a>: It's something, you know, just in the very short time that we've been meeting as a council, we've taken, you know, several resolutions that have been filed that we've been asking for draft ordinances to be put together on that have been two and three and four years in the making, not because the city solicitor wasn't able to do it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5872.152s">[Knight]</a>: Capability-wise, it was because he has to run the everyday operations of an entire city, as well as, you know, that he had the requests that this body makes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5881.957s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, I think that this is a step in the right direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5884.458s">[Knight]</a>: It was my number two priority, Mr. President, when we talked about council priorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5888.219s">[Knight]</a>: Number one, improving the way we deliver services here in this community, making sure that when you pick up the phone and call because your trash barrel wasn't picked up, that someone comes and picks it up for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5896.023s">[Knight]</a>: When you say there's a pothole in front of your house, it gets fixed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5898.344s">[Knight]</a>: When your sidewalk needs to be repaired, it gets done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5900.445s">[Knight]</a>: Number one priority, service delivery and improving the way we do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5902.927s">[Knight]</a>: Number two priority, getting counsel for the Medford City Council so that we can put out a better work product at a faster pace, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5930.94s">[Knight]</a>: Do need this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5932.32s">[Knight]</a>: We do really need this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5933.761s">[Knight]</a>: It's not something that we don't really need, Mr. Strehler, it's something that we do really need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5937.523s">[Knight]</a>: You know, when you're looking at the number of draft ordinances that we've requested just since this body's met this term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5942.793s">[Knight]</a>: We're looking at nine, nine draft ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5944.895s">[Knight]</a>: That's more, nine ordinances is more of a work product than we put out in a term, and I can't tell you in how long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5950.78s">[Knight]</a>: If we get those draft ordinances produced to us, I guarantee you we're gonna put out a stronger work product than we have in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5955.284s">[Knight]</a>: If we have some council that's working for us, dedicated X amount of hours a week, putting those work products out, I guarantee you we're gonna do more work than we've done in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5999.715s">[Knight]</a>: I think if you look at the ordinances before you, it says that the issue of funding for the City Council to hire an additional legal services line item be discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6007.379s">[Knight]</a>: Now, I think it's also important to point out, Mr. President, that Mayor Burke<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6010.407s">[Knight]</a>: during this fiscal year has already committed to us $40,000 for professional and legal services in the form of a zoning consultant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6016.63s">[Knight]</a>: That money's never actually been transferred into our line item for professional legal services in the city council's budget and the budget of the legislative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6024.133s">[Knight]</a>: It sits in a revolving fund for special services that lays in the auditor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6029.654s">[Knight]</a>: So, with that being said, you know, we already have funds that are available to us that have been committed to us and have been budgeted to us for the purposes of legal or professional technical services, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6037.702s">[Knight]</a>: I think what we're looking at doing is figuring out a way that we can best capture these funds and start utilizing them so that we can put out a stronger work product.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6109.758s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6111.683s">[Knight]</a>: Everybody that knows me knows I love my amichis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6114.812s">[Knight]</a>: Probably once a week at least, I go down to amichis and get.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6118.496s">[Knight]</a>: couple slices of pizza before I make my way up here to the city council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6121.937s">[Knight]</a>: I'll get two slices of cheese with that great, you know, sauce-cheese ratio and the great flop that they have down there at Amici's, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6129.039s">[Knight]</a>: But a couple weeks ago when I was getting out of my car to pick up my dinner before I came to the council meeting, I noticed that the drainage issue right in front of Amici's, recently they had a complete streets program down there and they did a bump out in the curb right where Amici's and Paul Revere's is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6144.924s">[Knight]</a>: And that bumped out, but the gradient isn't conducive to proper drainage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6149.573s">[Knight]</a>: So what's going on, Mr. President, is the water's pooling and it's becoming at least five, six, seven inches deep at some point, which renders that parking spot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6159.451s">[Knight]</a>: And that's the parking spot that sits right out in front of, you know, four businesses that specialize in takeout food, Hong Kong Village, CB Scoops, Amici's, and Paul Revere's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6170.278s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, it's having a negative impact on the businesses that worked on, that are operating down in West Bedford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6176.602s">[Knight]</a>: Also, when they did this complete streets project and they did put the bump out in, they took away a parking spot and a half.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6181.866s">[Knight]</a>: So to add, you know, insult to injury, on top of losing a parking spot, now there's another parking spot there that is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6188.73s">[Knight]</a>: virtually useless to the business district in times of inclement weather.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6192.391s">[Knight]</a>: So I'm asking that the engineering department take the appropriate steps to hold the contractor accountable that did the work and get them back out there to fix it so that the fine people that are trying to get a nice slice of pizza down there in West Medford Square are able to do so, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=116.409s">[Knight]</a>: Anytime that a motion's been made on the floor, communication with the city staff should come directly to the council until the individual constantly constantly made the motion right so ultimately, last week I raised the question as to whether or not this is a use that would have to go to our community development boards outline the chapter 94 of our zoning act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=132.621s">[Knight]</a>: And I asked the question as to whether or not this is one of those uses because the paper before us didn't say what the use was that we were voting on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=140.527s">[Knight]</a>: So the question would then come from this council to the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=144.129s">[Knight]</a>: The administration would assign it to a council, to a staff member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=147.21s">[Knight]</a>: The staff member would report back to this council via the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=150.091s">[Knight]</a>: I haven't received any correspondence or communication relative to this subject matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=153.772s">[Knight]</a>: I don't know if my colleagues have or if the clerk has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=174.145s">[Knight]</a>: Right, the question was whether or not it wasn't whether it wasn't allowed to use because a special permit right, it was allowed to use special permits before us the question was whether or not to go to the CD board before the council voted on it pursuant to 94.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=185.69s">[Knight]</a>: 9481B of the Zoning Act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=361.992s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=363.272s">[Knight]</a>: Although I did not know Mr. Palmisano.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=364.793s">[Knight]</a>: Well, he was a neighbor of mine grew up around the corner from him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=367.273s">[Knight]</a>: And he was always a gentleman that was well respected in the neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=370.274s">[Knight]</a>: If he's anything like his son Carmen, then we know that he's a great man.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=373.318s">[Knight]</a>: His son Carmen and I have become friends over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=375.621s">[Knight]</a>: Carmen carries himself as such a gentleman that it's only fitting to say it's a reflection of his father.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=381.108s">[Knight]</a>: And recently the city of Medford lost Mr. Parmesano, and I'd like to ask my council colleagues to join me in extending our deep and sincere condolences to the family of a lifelong Metro resident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1255.733s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1256.993s">[Knight]</a>: And looking at section two of this paper that's before us this evening, this proposal, it says the charter commission shall be composed of one commissioner elected from each of the eight wards and one elected at large.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1267.818s">[Knight]</a>: This paper also says that this charter review is being brought forward underneath chapter 43B of the general laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1274.72s">[Knight]</a>: If we look at section six of chapter 43B of the general laws, it says the charter commission shall consist of nine registered voters of the city or town elected at large.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1285.461s">[Knight]</a>: So it sounds to me like we have a conflict of language here right now, Mr. President, with the paper that's before us versus the plain language of the state law that governs charter review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1779.755s">[Knight]</a>: With all due respect, this council for three years has been beating our chest, screaming and yelling for legal representation, and now we're getting asked to schedule our meetings around the lawyers at KP Law that we haven't been able to meet with for two and a half years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2753.459s">[Knight]</a>: It's not about the license, it's about the process that we need to take as a body to be sure that we're compliant with the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3002.612s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3003.934s">[Knight]</a>: Not one of my normal resolutions that I put on, but I did get a call from a number of concerned citizens who were out walking their little pups and they had questions and concern as to whether or not the salt mix that the city was using was pet environmentally friendly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3017.024s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, I said I'll get an answer for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3019.366s">[Knight]</a>: This is the approach that I'm taking to get such.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3020.967s">[Knight]</a>: So I'd ask my council colleagues to support this measure and hopefully the answer is yes, but thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3027.733s">[Knight]</a>: Very pessimistic about that being the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3128.49s">[Knight]</a>: Relatively self explanatory Mr. President, this is a resolution that was put forward and passed by the previous council unanimously seven to nothing in April of 2021.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3137.233s">[Knight]</a>: I'm at that time this council struggling with the effects of the pandemic, we provided a draft resolution to solicitors office and we asked them to craft a resolution that would fit Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3146.817s">[Knight]</a>: The reason we asked for this was because of the impacts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3149.418s">[Knight]</a>: that the pandemic was having on the youth in our community, their ability to interact, the mental health pressures that they're facing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3154.701s">[Knight]</a>: Today, we still have not seen a draft ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3156.782s">[Knight]</a>: I'm hoping this is something that we can get in short order, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3160.643s">[Knight]</a>: April, May, June, we're getting there, you know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3163.305s">[Knight]</a>: It's almost the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3164.325s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, I ask my council colleagues to support the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3168.727s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3847.283s">[Knight]</a>: Any further discussion, if I may, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3849.504s">[Knight]</a>: Yes, I'd like to make a public service announcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3852.717s">[Knight]</a>: There's gonna be two feet of snow, there's gonna be a snow emergency, all right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3856.178s">[Knight]</a>: So, temporary signs, we don't need them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3858.699s">[Knight]</a>: If two feet of snow is coming, we're gonna be in a snow emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3863.3s">[Knight]</a>: That goes without saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3873.103s">[Knight]</a>: Yeah, winter starts in December, man.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3875.164s">[Knight]</a>: Don't you live here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3880.987s">[Knight]</a>: But ultimately, there's one thing I think that a lot of people don't do anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3885.93s">[Knight]</a>: And it's this crazy thing, they pick up the phone and they call somebody and they ask a question, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3890.053s">[Knight]</a>: Like call the police department and say, is it a snow emergency?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3892.935s">[Knight]</a>: And what side of the street am I supposed to park on, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3894.997s">[Knight]</a>: A lot of people are afraid to pick up the phone these days and call, but we have great resources here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3899.54s">[Knight]</a>: The police department staff 24 hours a day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3901.401s">[Knight]</a>: We have somebody at the police department that's in dispatch that could always answer a question if anybody has a question about where I went to park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3906.565s">[Knight]</a>: And we also have the night watch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3908.246s">[Knight]</a>: The night watchman in the DPW is also available to address questions and concerns like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3912.93s">[Knight]</a>: So there are resources out there for individuals in this community that have questions about where to park during snow emergencies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3920.317s">[Knight]</a>: The DPWs during snow emergencies is operating 24 hours a day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3923.88s">[Knight]</a>: So there's always someone that's available to answer a call and answer a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3927.163s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, I hope that the individuals out there in the community that are having such difficulty<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3932.088s">[Knight]</a>: figuring out where to park, also take advantage of some of these old fashioned resources, like not signing up for alerts, but picking up the phone and asking the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3939.152s">[Knight]</a>: Does that get you the same answer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4498.354s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I think, if my memory serves me correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4503.697s">[Knight]</a>: This paper was put on in the council voted to request that the mayor write a letter to the Gaming Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4510.882s">[Knight]</a>: The mayor wrote a letter to the Gaming Commission reported back to the council that you wrote a letter to the Gaming Commission and suggested that we do so as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4519.011s">[Knight]</a>: If we're going to send a letter to the Gaming Commission, after we just directed the mayor to send a letter to the Gaming Commission, I think we need to be sure that we're consistent in our message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4526.476s">[Knight]</a>: If we look at our agenda this evening, we want to send letters to every member of the State House, the Speaker, the Senate President, every member of our state delegation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4535.562s">[Knight]</a>: We want to send letters to the Mass Gaming Commission over here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4538.044s">[Knight]</a>: We're like letter-writing nuts right now, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4540.746s">[Knight]</a>: At the end of the day, we need to have a concise and consistent message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4543.91s">[Knight]</a>: It should be delivered as a city, not as one body in the city, this body in the city, we need to take a look at what the mayor wrote and craft a letter that shows some consistency, so that we're not asking for two different things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4555.885s">[Knight]</a>: I think that's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4557.326s">[Knight]</a>: All right, if we're going to be sending letters to places, we need to be sure that our game is tight, and that what we're asking for is what we're asking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4563.828s">[Knight]</a>: It's not for the cameras, it's for the policy, it's not for the politics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4567.669s">[Knight]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4568.129s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, ultimately, that's what it comes down to, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4570.63s">[Knight]</a>: I think that, you know, if we're going to be asking the Gaming Commission to take a stand, the stand that we're asking them to take can't be a stand of the city council, it can't be a stand of the administration, it has to be a stand of the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4582.586s">[Knight]</a>: stand all of us together unified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4584.767s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, I have no problem sending a letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4586.888s">[Knight]</a>: I just wish that we could probably work with the administration a little bit more cooperatively in addressing large issues like this that are impacting our community, especially when the mayor's action came at the directive of the council in the first place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4599.593s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, I support the intent of the paper, but I just want to be sure that what we're sending is a message of consistency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4609.394s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4610.416s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Caraviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5115.219s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I certainly support the theory of the measure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5118.982s">[Knight]</a>: I certainly support the measure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5120.003s">[Knight]</a>: It's something that's very interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5121.704s">[Knight]</a>: I question whether or not it needs to be reviewed by the solicitor or whether this came from legal counsel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5126.888s">[Knight]</a>: Maybe the other sponsor of the resolution can offer that this has been worked on through legal counsel of some shape or form, maybe with UFCW.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5312.592s">[Knight]</a>: Any further questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5313.552s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, that highlights some of the questions that I had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5315.993s">[Knight]</a>: It's certainly an interesting theory that the council can tie licensure requirements to union membership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5324.414s">[Knight]</a>: It's very interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5370.515s">[Knight]</a>: I was referring to wasn't the peace agreement, but rather the requirement that a project labor agreement be in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5379.028s">[Knight]</a>: Yeah, so I mean, Mr. Camacho I know you don't know me from a hole in the wall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5382.449s">[Knight]</a>: I came from the unions I worked at SIU for a number of years I negotiated over 40 contracts I represented close to 12,000 employees between Worcester and Essex County and Suffolk County and Middlesex County so I've certainly been familiar with the union world and it's something that I certainly want to support but like Councilor Behr said if we're going to do it let's do it right and if you like what you said if we're going to do it let's do it right so I just want to make sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5406.736s">[Knight]</a>: We don't get challenged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5407.637s">[Knight]</a>: We're in a process right now where it's taken probably, we're probably the slowest community in all the world to license the marijuana facility in Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5417.347s">[Knight]</a>: And we've gotten this far, and I'd hate to see the process stalled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5421.912s">[Knight]</a>: The administration's done a great job of doing that already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5424.435s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, I certainly support this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5426.237s">[Knight]</a>: I support working families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5427.771s">[Knight]</a>: And I always will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5428.671s">[Knight]</a>: If you don't know what you stand for, then you can't stand for anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5431.273s">[Knight]</a>: This is certainly something that I stand for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5433.073s">[Knight]</a>: I stand for good wages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5434.134s">[Knight]</a>: I stand for health benefits, retirement benefits for workers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5436.475s">[Knight]</a>: I stand for a living wage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5438.295s">[Knight]</a>: I think that these are things that bring our community up, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5441.177s">[Knight]</a>: If we have good wages in the community, then people can spend their ancillary money in the circular flow of our economy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5446.039s">[Knight]</a>: The discretionary funds go back into our economy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5448.119s">[Knight]</a>: It's a good thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5449.3s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, I support this wholeheartedly and I have no problem seconding the motion by the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5453.882s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5533.069s">[Knight]</a>: Because it's a zoning paper, Mr. President, and we have a zoning codification issue that's coming up, it doesn't have to be part of the codification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5539.25s">[Knight]</a>: It can go through as an amendment to the existing zoning ordinance for the cannabis licensure, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5546.592s">[Knight]</a>: And it can go through the process itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5548.153s">[Knight]</a>: In fact, we have to do it that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5549.813s">[Knight]</a>: We don't have to tie it to the recodification and blow that thing up, you know what I mean, as we're going through the process, because we're at the Penn Yard line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5736.408s">[Knight]</a>: We're gonna have a motion to join it right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5741.598s">[Knight]</a>: And then we vote on the motion to join it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5743.679s">[Knight]</a>: And then the motion goes down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5745.721s">[Knight]</a>: You really can't bring it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5780.125s">[Knight]</a>: We'll have the opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5781.166s">[Knight]</a>: Well, why don't we amend the paper to ask for a legal opinion on this language right here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5784.768s">[Knight]</a>: The senator has a solicitor now, she'll get that back to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5786.949s">[Knight]</a>: That's fine, yeah, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5833.785s">[Knight]</a>: One major question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5844.458s">[Knight]</a>: If we want the solicitor to give us a legal opinion we need to ask the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5884.873s">[Knight]</a>: That's not a legal question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5885.854s">[Knight]</a>: That's an operational question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6090.131s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, this gentleman works for the UFCW as a representative of a labor organization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6094.394s">[Knight]</a>: He's not an entity with the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6098.517s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not sure- I assume.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6124.001s">[Knight]</a>: The gentleman is a representative of a labor organization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6126.342s">[Knight]</a>: He's not a representative of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6127.923s">[Knight]</a>: He probably doesn't even know who is applied here in the city of Medford because he doesn't work for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6168.3s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6747.002s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6747.843s">[Knight]</a>: I would just like to reiterate my concern that this council's focus should be on the items that fall within its purview and control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6754.807s">[Knight]</a>: We have a very, very responsible, receptive, and capable state delegation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6760.21s">[Knight]</a>: A very, very capable state delegation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6763.231s">[Knight]</a>: We're not the House of Representatives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6765.292s">[Knight]</a>: We're not the Massachusetts Senate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6767.173s">[Knight]</a>: Thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of bills are introduced every day in both parties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6772.506s">[Knight]</a>: This council is gonna sit here and spend our time weeding through those bills and not doing the job that we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6778.009s">[Knight]</a>: We're doing something wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6779.77s">[Knight]</a>: We're elected to do the city's business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6782.451s">[Knight]</a>: This is State House talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6783.872s">[Knight]</a>: For this reason and this reason alone, I'm not gonna support this measure tonight, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6787.654s">[Knight]</a>: Week in and week out, send a letter to Karen Spilka, send a letter to Ron Mariano, send a letter to Karen Spilka, send a letter to Ron Mariano.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6794.157s">[Knight]</a>: Enough's enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6795.478s">[Knight]</a>: They're gonna think we're lunatics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6797.583s">[Knight]</a>: Every other week, they're getting a letter from the Medford City Council saying, Medford wants this now, Medford wants that now, Medford wants this now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6802.504s">[Knight]</a>: This guy in Medford, you know what I want?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6803.864s">[Knight]</a>: More money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6804.844s">[Knight]</a>: There's one paper on this agenda this evening that I will support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6809.065s">[Knight]</a>: A paper asking for an increase in House Fund funds to this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6812.086s">[Knight]</a>: I will support that paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6813.706s">[Knight]</a>: But as for us, continuously, week in and week out, supporting this piece of legislation, that piece of legislation, this piece of legislation at the State House, it's not moving this council forward, it's not moving this city forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6824.608s">[Knight]</a>: It's moving an agenda forward,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6826.513s">[Knight]</a>: but it's not moving us forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7514.039s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, from a procedural standpoint, there is a paper that's pending.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7519.98s">[Knight]</a>: We'll kind of put the cap before the horse, this is why I raised the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7632.996s">[Knight]</a>: I don't necessarily agree with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7635.418s">[Knight]</a>: It's our point of information is our point of personal privilege.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7638.139s">[Knight]</a>: Ultimately, the paper that they have before me is asking whether or not the papers that we're going to be voting on that we just taken from the table are in compliance with the general laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7647.321s">[Knight]</a>: So if this paper wouldn't be moved, and we take a vote, and then the vote says that we're not in compliance with the general laws, I think it was a situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7656.17s">[Knight]</a>: And that's just my understanding of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7658.573s">[Knight]</a>: And looking at the way that positions have been created and the way positions have been funded, I think we have a significant financial transparency issue, and I think we have a significant financial compliance issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7669.028s">[Knight]</a>: especially with chapter 44 section 33a related to the human resource directors position and potentially these as well that are outlined in this paper and that's why I raised the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7677.676s">[Knight]</a>: Everybody behind this rail took an oath.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7679.497s">[Knight]</a>: Part of that oath was to uphold the rules of the constitution, the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the ordinances of the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7686.403s">[Knight]</a>: I don't think anybody behind this rail can answer the question as to whether or not the city of Medford is in compliance with chapter 44 section 33a.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7693.356s">[Knight]</a>: Quite frankly, I don't think our CFO can answer that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7696.418s">[Knight]</a>: But I do raise the question because if I'm going to be taking a vote and putting my name on it, I want that vote to be in line with the oath I took.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7702.722s">[Knight]</a>: That's why I've asked for this paper to come first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7705.123s">[Knight]</a>: I won't be supporting the three papers that are before me this evening because this paper, I think, addresses a lot of the questions that have been raised over duration relative to the compensation adjustment factor system and the approach that the administration is taking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7745.622s">[Knight]</a>: This is an ordinance for third reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7747.503s">[Knight]</a>: It will need five votes for passage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7749.024s">[Knight]</a>: Failure to pass will result in the paper being tabled for a period of 90 days and not being able to be reintroduced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7756.886s">[Knight]</a>: What role is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7757.967s">[Knight]</a>: It's an ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7759.187s">[Knight]</a>: An ordinance is required five votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7760.727s">[Knight]</a>: So if this doesn't pass, then it fails.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7762.448s">[Knight]</a>: And if the paper fails, it's been disposed of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7764.089s">[Knight]</a>: And if it's disposed of, the paper can't be reintroduced to the council for a period of 90 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7773.272s">[Knight]</a>: It's 44.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7775.009s">[Knight]</a>: Look at this chapter 44.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7780.576s">[Knight]</a>: If we had legal counsel, it'd be like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7789.188s">[Knight]</a>: You need four to take off effectively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7818.323s">[Knight]</a>: It's chapter 44.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7819.423s">[Knight]</a>: It'd be around section 18 or 20.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7824.366s">[Knight]</a>: I think section 22 has to do with the financial paper being tabled initially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7831.529s">[Knight]</a>: Section 134, administration of government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7833.57s">[Knight]</a>: Chapter 43 is for finance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7835.031s">[Knight]</a>: Off hand, no. But I know I'm right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7849.667s">[Knight]</a>: Would somebody like to call President Demeritus, Robert Mayorko?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7884.311s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not challenging the ruling of the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8169.229s">[Knight]</a>: To permit a member voting present when the motion order resolution under consideration by the council forbid his or her participation as the conflict interest of law directs such members should do so should should so address the council in the chair and for me as to why the Councilor is voting president present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8187.321s">[Knight]</a>: I don't think there's anything in here that says you can vote present unless I think you have to vote unless you have a conflict of interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8192.569s">[Knight]</a>: There's a rule in there and I think that that's not it, as I look at it, but from what I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8207.925s">[Knight]</a>: It happened again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8350.833s">[Knight]</a>: I'll be happy to move for reconsideration should the paper come back requiring five votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8358.018s">[Knight]</a>: I will for reconsideration put it back on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8359.639s">[Knight]</a>: I have no problem with that, but you're saying that I lost the vote, so I can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8363.2s">[Knight]</a>: I can only move for reconsideration if I won the vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8379.487s">[Knight]</a>: Move for reconsideration on the paper and then ask that it be tabled and then we'd say yes and yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8384.448s">[Knight]</a>: We move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8549.341s">[Knight]</a>: It's a public information paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8551.782s">[Knight]</a>: It's a public participation paper that has no number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8554.082s">[Knight]</a>: So the clerk has the authority to include it on the agenda next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8558.044s">[Knight]</a>: The council doesn't take action on those papers anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8560.104s">[Knight]</a>: We just sit there and listen, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8561.064s">[Knight]</a>: And then it's up to us to take an action on it the next week, the following week to comply with OML.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8564.945s">[Knight]</a>: So the clerk can just reissue that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=44.707s">[Knight]</a>: Madam President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=46.408s">[Knight]</a>: Jerry DeCristofaro, who passed away February 26th, he was a lifelong resident, lived in Summit Road, the father of Barbara DeCristofaro from Metro Police Department and Dr. DeCristofaro Registrar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=59.215s">[Knight]</a>: Jerry spent 45 years in public service for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=63.038s">[Knight]</a>: He served as Chief Investigator for the Licensing Board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=67.7s">[Knight]</a>: He was responsible for establishing the rules and regulations there and enforcing standards for our licensees in the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=74.324s">[Knight]</a>: known for his classic resemblance to Luciano Pavarotti.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=79.747s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. De Cristofaro was someone that was loved by many.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=82.669s">[Knight]</a>: He had failing health in his later years, but I remember him fondly growing up in metropolitics as someone who's always been there to lend an ear and lend wisdom and lend advice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=91.674s">[Knight]</a>: He's certainly someone that did a great deal for this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=94.356s">[Knight]</a>: He raised two wonderful children who<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=96.53s">[Knight]</a>: believe in service, as evidenced by their work, and he will be sadly missed Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=101.912s">[Knight]</a>: So, Jerry to Christopher our dear friend who served this community in this Commonwealth of Massachusetts for the better part of 50 years, I'd ask that this council joins me in extending condolences to his family on their recent loss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=275.74s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. Brennan, I wish you the best of luck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=277.101s">[Knight]</a>: I certainly have no problem with this application that's before us this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=280.622s">[Knight]</a>: I'm looking forward to seeing the Cummings Center come to completion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=283.303s">[Knight]</a>: I think this will be a nice, what they call, anchor store to bring some foot traffic through the neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=290.165s">[Knight]</a>: There's a couple with the opening of the Green Line Extension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=293.166s">[Knight]</a>: Hopefully in a few short months, we'll transform that neighborhood to make it a little bit more vibrant and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=297.868s">[Knight]</a>: We all know if there's a Starbucks, people go there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=300.831s">[Knight]</a>: So it'd be nice to see us put traffic down there and another opportunity and an option for an amenity for some of the college students and neighborhood residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=307.516s">[Knight]</a>: So thank you for your application, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=339.57s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=515.798s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=543.865s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1837.486s">[Knight]</a>: I'm on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1838.506s">[Knight]</a>: I'm on now, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1839.427s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1840.487s">[Knight]</a>: I do know we have representatives from the administration here as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1843.308s">[Knight]</a>: In my conversation with the mayor earlier this afternoon, it's my understanding that these two amendments would create classifications that are more in line with the functions and responsibilities that these individuals are performing in their office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1854.411s">[Knight]</a>: The first amendment, amendment A, for director of communications, it's my understanding, would be a reflective title of the position that was held by Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1860.573s">[Knight]</a>: Devaney.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1861.435s">[Knight]</a>: under the previous administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1862.976s">[Knight]</a>: And it's also my understanding that the Director of Community Affairs position under Amendment B would be reflective of the position that Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1868.961s">[Knight]</a>: Fisk held under the previous administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1870.763s">[Knight]</a>: So what this is, Mr. President, is actually bringing their functional titles to be in line with the duties and responsibilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1876.727s">[Knight]</a>: But I won't steal Dave's thunder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1878.929s">[Knight]</a>: Let him give us a brief synopsis of what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1881.631s">[Knight]</a>: I'd appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1905.863s">[Knight]</a>: Yeah, Mr. President, if I may, I spoke with the mayor last Thursday or Friday about the same issue, requested job descriptions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1912.748s">[Knight]</a>: I know she forwarded them to the city clerk's office, and the city clerk had distributed them to the members of the body as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1918.032s">[Knight]</a>: I, for one, Councilor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1919.224s">[Knight]</a>: I don't see any issue with this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1920.545s">[Knight]</a>: I think that the mayor deserves the right to be able to surround herself with her own team for what she feels is going to make her time in the corner office successful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1928.248s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, I move for approval of the paper, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1930.849s">[Knight]</a>: It is an ordinance, so it's going to have to go through three readings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3302.403s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3303.624s">[Knight]</a>: And Mr. Bernal, thank you for being here this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3306.464s">[Knight]</a>: So what I'm hearing is that ultimately you're coming before us this evening to ask for the tools that you need to necessarily comply with state mandates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3315.867s">[Knight]</a>: And meet the objectives of the office that have been put forth by the Board of Assessors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3320.368s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, move for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3650.435s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3651.677s">[Knight]</a>: I'd like to make a suggestion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3653.721s">[Knight]</a>: This is a PACS project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3655.664s">[Knight]</a>: We are well aware that the PACS department does have a revolving account that's open with modern hardware, I do believe, with a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3663.001s">[Knight]</a>: do purchase a lot of their paint supplies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3664.862s">[Knight]</a>: So it might make sense to coordinate with IDPW because I believe we do get some bulk purchasing rates versus regular retail rates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3672.586s">[Knight]</a>: So this $3,000 might actually end up being $4,500 if we spend it the right way with some of our in-house contacts that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3679.449s">[Knight]</a>: So I'd suggest that you meet with the PACS Commissioner, Mike Nestor, and speak with him a little bit about whether or not you guys can utilize the account that they have available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3689.054s">[Knight]</a>: And use their bulk purchasing to get some of the supplies that you need to get this done But congratulations, wish you the best of luck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4024.517s">[Knight]</a>: Retabling the public hearing or retabling the vote on the petition?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4032.022s">[Knight]</a>: He left, no he's not, so that's why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4033.782s">[Knight]</a>: Okay, sounds good to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4312.675s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4313.897s">[Knight]</a>: I bring this paper forward in response to the 223-2020 legal opinion of the acting city solicitor, which responded to a question asked by the President that was prompted from an inquiry from a citizen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4328.412s">[Knight]</a>: And the question was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4331.519s">[Knight]</a>: Is a paper offered under suspension, is a resolution offered under suspension a violation of the council rules because it's not on the agenda?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4338.123s">[Knight]</a>: And the question was asked in the broadest of terms and the solicitor answered it in the broadest of terms and the response came back yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4344.586s">[Knight]</a>: Papers that do not show up on the agenda that are brought up under suspension are violations of the open meeting law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4349.669s">[Knight]</a>: Then the solicitor's response went on to go into specific detail about matters that could be reasonably foreseen and matters that could not be reasonably foreseen and emergency matters, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4360.552s">[Knight]</a>: So in an effort to allow us to still raise certain issues under suspension and in review of some open meeting law,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4367.714s">[Knight]</a>: determinations that I was able to put my hands on, one of them being the Oxbridge decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4371.897s">[Knight]</a>: I came up with some language that would allow us hopefully to have the ability to still offer papers under suspension, but still comply with the open meeting law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4379.703s">[Knight]</a>: Because based upon the 310-2020 committee of the whole that we just had, there was a lot of discussion surrounding the solicitor's opinion and what could or could not be offered under suspension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4389.961s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, this is an attempt to address the solicitor's opinion and still provide us with the flexibility that's necessary based upon some open meeting law determinations that have been issued by the Office of the Attorney General.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4401.444s">[Knight]</a>: As we are all aware, the Office of the Attorney General is the authority that's responsible for compliance with the open meeting law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4407.965s">[Knight]</a>: Any complaints that would be filed against this public body deliberating in violation of the open meeting law would be handled by the Office of the Attorney General, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4415.686s">[Knight]</a>: What I'd like to do is ask that this paper be sent to the city solicitor for a legal review to see if it complies with her legal opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4423.573s">[Knight]</a>: and get a response back, and then potentially take a look at the way that we do business internally to ensure that we have more transparency, but we still also have the ability and availability to bring papers under suspension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4433.502s">[Knight]</a>: The first meeting of this term, Mr. President, I did put a paper forward requesting that we change the night of our meetings from Tuesdays to Wednesdays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4439.286s">[Knight]</a>: And the reason I brought that proposal forward was because, based upon the open meeting law, you need to have 48 hours before your meeting to have the notice posted with the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4448.854s">[Knight]</a>: Because our meetings are on Tuesday, weekends and holidays don't count.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4452.157s">[Knight]</a>: So we need to have to get our agenda out on Friday morning or Thursday afternoon, dependent on whether or not we had a Monday holiday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4458.12s">[Knight]</a>: So that would only allow us a very limited amount of time to put items on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4462.863s">[Knight]</a>: Upon review of items that have been filed on the agenda, it was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4468.08s">[Knight]</a>: pretty one in every four, every five matters that this council discussed by way of resolution that was getting put on the agenda, was getting put on under suspension and never being actually placed on the agenda and seen by the general public when the notice was posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4481.289s">[Knight]</a>: So this prompts me to bring forward another proposal for rule changes to allow us to be a little bit more transparent, to allow us to have some items on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4489.815s">[Knight]</a>: for discussion and deliberation or to put items on the agenda at a future date for discussion and deliberation that come up under suspension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4496.879s">[Knight]</a>: So I'd ask my council colleagues to support this measure in moving this matter to the city solicitor's office for a legal review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4502.062s">[Knight]</a>: And that's about it, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4503.883s">[Knight]</a>: That's the presentation in a box and bow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4526.834s">[Knight]</a>: This has no impact whatsoever at all on the public participation portion of our meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4532.16s">[Knight]</a>: This is really just related to council action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4534.202s">[Knight]</a>: Only a councilor can bring forward a resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4535.924s">[Knight]</a>: Only a councilor can make a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4537.846s">[Knight]</a>: So this only affects the actual conduct of councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4709.233s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I do believe that pursuant to the council rules, every 90 days you can introduce a paper that's been deliberated on and addressed and deliberated to conclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4717.436s">[Knight]</a>: So I'm really not too sure what he's getting at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4720.237s">[Knight]</a>: Ultimately, the city solicitor issued an opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4721.878s">[Knight]</a>: That opinion came out on February 23rd, 2020.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5101.321s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5103.586s">[Knight]</a>: This is an attempt to establish an extended illness leave bank by ordinance for all city and school department employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5109.837s">[Knight]</a>: An extended illness leave bank is a bank where existing employees can donate one of their leave days to a pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5117.642s">[Knight]</a>: And if one of their co-workers suffers a catastrophic injury or illness, they're able to draw down upon those leave days if they've exhausted all of their own.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5125.887s">[Knight]</a>: And there are certain parameters and requirements that are in place to be sure the people that become eligible to draw down these extended illness leave days aren't sick leave abusers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5135.185s">[Knight]</a>: The state has a very similar program, and when I say very similar, I copied the language from Massachusetts General Law Chapter 4, Section 7P.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5143.646s">[Knight]</a>: I'm sorry, Chapter 7, Section 4P, to create this ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5147.407s">[Knight]</a>: And then just put in that advisory council language, Mr. President, how we're going to administer this sick leave bank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5155.148s">[Knight]</a>: So what I'd ask is that we obviously have a committee of the whole on a piece of legislation that's this wordy with the city solicitor and the director of personnel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5164.509s">[Knight]</a>: to determine what steps we can take to establish an extended illness leave bank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5169.112s">[Knight]</a>: I said that we should first make a 75 day investment in the bank to get it up and running to allow existing employees that are out on extended leave to begin to draw down on the bank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5178.857s">[Knight]</a>: And then we can establish an extended illness leave bank advisory council that will be able to come up with rules, regulations, monitor the program and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5189.142s">[Knight]</a>: The Director of Personnel is the Program Administrator, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5192.644s">[Knight]</a>: So this is really an attempt to try to put something in place to do something good for the residents, for the workers here in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5198.686s">[Knight]</a>: When you sit back and you think about people that have suffered from catastrophic injury and catastrophic illness here in the city of Medford, you think of people like Richard Lee,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5208.77s">[Knight]</a>: fought a very, very public battle with pancreatic cancer and wasn't able to beat it, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5213.456s">[Knight]</a>: But had 40 years of service here in this building, but was still out for an extended period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5219.723s">[Knight]</a>: And we talk about someone like Joe Conway or Brian Rabbit, who we all<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5227.22s">[Knight]</a>: stood beside and wished him well wishes when he's going through a very public battle with pancreatic cancer right now, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5233.683s">[Knight]</a>: This is something that'll help employees that have been good public servants here in the community, that have given their all to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5239.825s">[Knight]</a>: I'm hoping that we can put something in place that provides a protection and a safeguard for these employees, so that if something unforeseen and catastrophic does happen related to their health or their physical well-being, that there's a safety net that's there for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5251.17s">[Knight]</a>: We value our employees, and I think that we should make steps to show it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5377.902s">[Knight]</a>: Based upon the language of the ordinance that is proposed, it gives discretionary authority to the extended on this lead bank advisory committee to come up with the regulations to determine what will work for both the workers in the community, what will work for the city in the school department, because we don't want to obviously also have a financial situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5397.97s">[Knight]</a>: It's pretty much, aside from the 75 days that first get dumped into the pool by the government, after that, it's all donated days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5405.738s">[Knight]</a>: And the parameters would be established by the extended illness leave bank advisory committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5409.042s">[Knight]</a>: So no parameters has been established on how many days people can put in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5413.667s">[Knight]</a>: No, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5415.188s">[Knight]</a>: I believe the language says, and it's right in the second paragraph, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5424.628s">[Knight]</a>: Any employees completed one day of service may participate by donating to said bank any earned, sick, personal, or vacation leave time in such an amount and with such frequency as said regulations shall permit to maintain a sufficient balance in the bank, but not less frequently than annually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5567.167s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5568.828s">[Knight]</a>: This is a companion paper to the one relative to the rules that we discussed earlier, 20089.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5576.868s">[Knight]</a>: What this paper does is it defines what an order is, what a resolution is, what a petition is, and establishes a process, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5583.03s">[Knight]</a>: Now, we've seen, especially around election time, the inordinate number of petitions that get filed at the rail to discuss issues that aren't necessarily something that requires a council vote, a special permit, a signed reversal, grant a location, and the like, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5597.934s">[Knight]</a>: So only a Councilor can file a resolution pursuant to our laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5601.195s">[Knight]</a>: Only a Councilor can file an order or an ordinance pursuant to council resolutions in the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5606.737s">[Knight]</a>: So what this does is it just defines what a petition is, it defines who's an appropriate petitioner and who isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5611.623s">[Knight]</a>: And someone that's not an appropriate petitioner would still have the ability to come up to the council and discuss anything that they want to discuss with the council and appear before the council when the time is right at the meeting, during the public participation portion of the meeting, wherever that may be, because it seems like there's an appetite to move that based upon the discussion that we've had surrounding the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5627.761s">[Knight]</a>: in recent days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5629.102s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, this is nothing more than an attempt to provide a little bit more order, a little bit more transparency, and streamlining the process for the way that we do things so that we don't run into a situation that we discussed earlier in our committee of the whole meeting, violations of the open meeting law and circus-like atmospheres coming up here at the council meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5647.068s">[Knight]</a>: So that's the intent of the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5649.388s">[Knight]</a>: That's why I'm bringing it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5650.529s">[Knight]</a>: You know, every order and resolution must be endorsed by a Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5654.47s">[Knight]</a>: Because the council rules also say that any paper that's on the agenda has to be disposed up to a conclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5660.055s">[Knight]</a>: If someone files a petition, but they don't have official business before the council that requires the council to vote statutorily, it's in essence the filing of a resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5668.242s">[Knight]</a>: So that should be placed in the public participation portion of the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5671.204s">[Knight]</a>: Very similar to the matter that we have on the agenda here this evening, I do believe, under 20099.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5680.352s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my council colleagues to support the paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5805.893s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5806.874s">[Knight]</a>: Council night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5808.44s">[Knight]</a>: I do believe the term is referred to as bully pulpit, Mr. President, and when you become an elected councilor, you have the right to file any resolution or order that you'd like, and it comes up to the rest of your colleagues to determine whether or not they feel as though that's something that they want to pass on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5821.244s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, I thank the gentleman for coming up here and agreeing with me, and I hope we can move forward on the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6005.071s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6006.092s">[Knight]</a>: I do believe if the gentleman reads down to the next sentence, all of the petitions filed shall be placed on the public participation portion of the agenda and not assigned to council paper number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6014.599s">[Knight]</a>: So anybody that does file a petition that doesn't comply with the statutory mandates that require council action would then be placed on public participation and still have the opportunity to show up on the agenda under public participation, still have the opportunity to appear before this body and speak just like they have in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6030.0s">[Knight]</a>: just whether or not they get assigned a council paper number because it's really filing of a resolution if you're getting assigned a paper number because our council rules require us to dispose of all items on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6043.067s">[Knight]</a>: So that's what my intent was, Mr. President, to clarify and streamline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6319.759s">[Knight]</a>: If the paper doesn't fall within the parameters of what a petition is defined as, then it would be pushed into public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6326.764s">[Knight]</a>: I didn't propose any order of business changes to the council rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6330.947s">[Knight]</a>: I'd be happy to put something together and offer that next week if you guys want me to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6334.409s">[Knight]</a>: It seems like I'm on fire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6339.072s">[Knight]</a>: But you know it's the plain language reads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6342.235s">[Knight]</a>: You know if it's not something that the council is required to act on by law It's not if we if it's something that you know if we don't act on it's going to be constructively accepted Then it will go to public participation presentations and all of that can go right to public participation unless they're requested by a council of a council at sponsoring someone to come and do a presentation and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6363.772s">[Knight]</a>: So Mr. President, I think if the council takes a vote to say we want INSTA to come and do a presentation on the pipeline project, that's one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6371.537s">[Knight]</a>: But if someone shows up and says, I want to talk about the Red Sox middle relievers, you know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6377.16s">[Knight]</a>: That goes to public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6379.542s">[Knight]</a>: We're asking someone to come and give us a presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6381.283s">[Knight]</a>: That's one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6381.723s">[Knight]</a>: If someone wants to discuss with us what's going on, that should happen in public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6391.795s">[Knight]</a>: In just in looking at the rules when I was reviewing the suspension of the rule stuff and then I saw the petition as well and you know no order or resolution should be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6401.809s">[Knight]</a>: It can be filed by anybody but a councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6403.531s">[Knight]</a>: So once that paper gets filed and it gets a number on it, that's a resolution number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6407.675s">[Knight]</a>: That's a council paper number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6409.097s">[Knight]</a>: That's someone filing an ordinance that's not a member of the board or the body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6412.52s">[Knight]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6413.181s">[Knight]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6415.303s">[Knight]</a>: Because we have to dispose of all items on the agenda that are given a board number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6422.898s">[Knight]</a>: But you have to dispose of all items on the agenda, regardless.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6432.546s">[Knight]</a>: That's one way to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6494.836s">[Knight]</a>: It streamlines our internal operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6564.741s">[Knight]</a>: Just as I stated in my presentation, Mr. President, this is more about defining the parameters of what it is that we're trying to do and streamlining the way that we do it so that our meetings don't turn into a circus-like atmosphere and environment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6576.176s">[Knight]</a>: You know, the more that we know, the more that we have it defined, the better off we are, in my opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6580.338s">[Knight]</a>: You know, that's where I'm coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6582.239s">[Knight]</a>: There's no nefarious intent here, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6584.639s">[Knight]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6585.26s">[Knight]</a>: I'm just trying to make sure that we do things properly and that we streamline things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6588.221s">[Knight]</a>: We've gotten an opinion from the city solicitor that I think should be given a little bit of attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6592.743s">[Knight]</a>: I think it's, you know, a little bit serious when the solicitor gives us an opinion that says that any time you take something up that's not on the agenda or under suspension, that it's a violation of the open meeting law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6601.446s">[Knight]</a>: then all the talk that surrounded that suspension talk was whether or not people were going to have the opportunity to come up to the podium and speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6607.672s">[Knight]</a>: We have a dedicated section in our agenda for people to come up to speak on any topic they want, whenever they want, however they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6614.799s">[Knight]</a>: So I'm not seeing how this is having any impact on anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6618.622s">[Knight]</a>: All it is is internal controls for the council and how the council operates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6626.797s">[Knight]</a>: And I don't think, and I'm not taking that away Councilor at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6736.06s">[Knight]</a>: Point of information, Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6737.421s">[Knight]</a>: The proposal says that all the petitions filed shall be placed on the public participation portion of the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6742.465s">[Knight]</a>: So I don't understand why we wouldn't be able to deliberate on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6744.887s">[Knight]</a>: It's still on the council agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6754.974s">[Knight]</a>: It doesn't matter if it has a number or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6756.675s">[Knight]</a>: If it's on the agenda, it's on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6757.956s">[Knight]</a>: What I'm saying is that it shouldn't be assigned a number because all papers on the agenda need to be disposed of in one fashion or another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6764.619s">[Knight]</a>: Only a consulate can file an order of resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6767.641s">[Knight]</a>: So at the end of the day, if someone files a petition that doesn't comply with the proposed rule change, they get put on the agenda under public participation, the section that it's appropriate for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6780.558s">[Knight]</a>: But as long as it shows up on the agenda, based on the solicitor's opinion, I see no reason why we wouldn't be able to deliberate, discern, or take any further action as a body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6789.512s">[Knight]</a>: Because it's on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6827.979s">[Knight]</a>: The city clerk is well aware of the fact that, you know, if someone applies for a grant of location, we're an administrative authority, we're a tribunal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6834.881s">[Knight]</a>: So there's an application that's necessary to be filed in the clerk's office for any of these actions to take place, whether it's a grant of location, a conviction was licensed, a sign reversal, there has to be some sort of application action that takes place in the clerk's office to prompt that to come here from an administrative standpoint in government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6979.917s">[Knight]</a>: Official business matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6982.848s">[Knight]</a>: For example, we had a Kino license that sat on the table for a number of days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6987.031s">[Knight]</a>: The Kino license was in our Zoning Act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6989.532s">[Knight]</a>: Because it's in our Zoning Act and we're the special permit granting authority, it falls under Chapter 48, Section 5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6994.455s">[Knight]</a>: There are actions that we need to take and we need to act in a certain amount of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6997.597s">[Knight]</a>: I believe the amount of time was 90 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6999.698s">[Knight]</a>: Failure to act within that 90-day period results in a constructive acceptance of the Kino license at that location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7006.322s">[Knight]</a>: If we don't take a vote on it, it's a constructive acceptance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7010.025s">[Knight]</a>: It also opens us up to legal<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7012.879s">[Knight]</a>: action because it's within our zoning act and we failed to act as a special permit granting authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7017.465s">[Knight]</a>: So what I'm trying to do, Mr. President, is delineate items that are under council purview and require council action and items that aren't under council purview and that council can't effectuate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7028.382s">[Knight]</a>: in terms of taking a vote and it's happening tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7030.545s">[Knight]</a>: You're approved, it's done, expect to have it tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7033.408s">[Knight]</a>: There are certain items that come before this body that we can't do that on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7037.132s">[Knight]</a>: A lot of items we're asking people across the hall to do stuff for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7040.216s">[Knight]</a>: What I'm saying is if in fact we're going to have a petition that gets filed, the petition should be for something that requires council action by law so that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7047.284s">[Knight]</a>: We're aware that this is something that's serious business, that's part of our job, that we're required to take action on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7052.527s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not saying that public participation is something that shouldn't happen, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7056.77s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not saying that that section should be eliminated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7059.092s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not saying that people should not be allowed to participate in public at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7063.314s">[Knight]</a>: What I'm saying is let's streamline the processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7065.116s">[Knight]</a>: Let's define what a petition is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7066.657s">[Knight]</a>: Let's say this is what a petition is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7068.057s">[Knight]</a>: It's something that requires council action because if we let the ball drop on a petition,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7072.16s">[Knight]</a>: we open ourselves up to certain legal ramifications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7074.341s">[Knight]</a>: We have certain obligations based upon the oath that we took, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7077.582s">[Knight]</a>: Some of those things are duties and responsibilities that were required to execute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7081.723s">[Knight]</a>: The majority of those duties and responsibilities that come before this council that were required to execute by statute of law comes in the form of a petition by way of an application for action by the council pursuant to some sort of established and enabled legislation, whether it be the granting of locations, the reversal of signs, the issuance of convictual licenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7100.939s">[Knight]</a>: Right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7101.72s">[Knight]</a>: So all I'm saying is a petition is reserved for those matters that require council action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7106.943s">[Knight]</a>: And if we don't take it, then we're in violation and everything else can go into public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7111.145s">[Knight]</a>: If someone wants to come before the council and speak, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7113.347s">[Knight]</a>: Come before the council and speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7114.788s">[Knight]</a>: Just do it at the right spot of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7174.394s">[Knight]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7174.695s">[Knight]</a>: Point of information, Council Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7176.336s">[Knight]</a>: Rule 33, order of business, item 10, public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7180.578s">[Knight]</a>: It's outlined in the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7181.599s">[Knight]</a>: It didn't show up on the agenda because there is no public participation paper on the agenda this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7186.38s">[Knight]</a>: but it is outlined in the order of business under rule 33.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7252.11s">[Knight]</a>: And I'm not gonna suggest any, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7258.215s">[Knight]</a>: The filing of petitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7261.28s">[Knight]</a>: shall be reserved for these matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7262.761s">[Knight]</a>: All other petitions filed shall be placed in this portion of the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7271.066s">[Knight]</a>: Right, and how many times do you think people fill out a petition that don't actually have the requirement for council action by law that still file the petition?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7280.332s">[Knight]</a>: So someone's going to file a petition, right, and the clerk's going to have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7283.274s">[Knight]</a>: The clerk's going to look at it and go, yeah, this isn't something that's required by law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7287.316s">[Knight]</a>: Put that on public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7461.279s">[Knight]</a>: The way that I envision this, Mr. President, would be Mr. Krause gets up and he's, you know, filed for to be on the agenda during the public participation portion of the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7470.301s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. Krause gets up and he speaks about something that he cares a lot about, which would be a scoreboard at Playstead Park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7475.743s">[Knight]</a>: All right, let's say, you know, we're trying to push for a scoreboard at Playstead Park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7479.564s">[Knight]</a>: These are the steps we've taken to get the scoreboard at Playstead Park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7482.164s">[Knight]</a>: We're looking for the council help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7484.665s">[Knight]</a>: What can the council do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7486.525s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, motion to, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7489.434s">[Knight]</a>: make an amendment relative to motion to make a resolution on behalf of Mr. Crouch's speech that the city of Medford take the following steps to affirmatively secure the school board a place to park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7500.7s">[Knight]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7501.04s">[Knight]</a>: You made a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7501.9s">[Knight]</a>: Everybody agree with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7502.801s">[Knight]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7503.041s">[Knight]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7503.381s">[Knight]</a>: It's assigned a paper number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7504.301s">[Knight]</a>: There you go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7504.922s">[Knight]</a>: Follow up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7506.943s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor just took the council just took ownership of that issue, put their name on it, said, this is mine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7511.725s">[Knight]</a>: I'm making this motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7512.706s">[Knight]</a>: I'm owning this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7513.266s">[Knight]</a>: I'm putting ownership on this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7592.499s">[Knight]</a>: I just wanted to say that I prefaced my comments with Mr. Krause, and I said, say that he had put the paper on for public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7601.781s">[Knight]</a>: We did it in advance, because we all- What if he didn't?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7604.862s">[Knight]</a>: Then we can't talk about it, because the city solicitor gave us the opinion already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7608.563s">[Knight]</a>: Regardless of whether or not we change petition or don't change petition, we can't talk about it, because the solicitor already said it'd be a violation of the open meeting law the minute the body deliberates on a matter that's not on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7619.411s">[Knight]</a>: It would still be on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7620.832s">[Knight]</a>: That's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7621.372s">[Knight]</a>: It's on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7622.072s">[Knight]</a>: It's going to be in public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7623.813s">[Knight]</a>: What's the difference?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7624.313s">[Knight]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7625.294s">[Knight]</a>: It's just a different section of the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7627.035s">[Knight]</a>: So if he's on the agenda under public participation, he has the right to come up and talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7631.056s">[Knight]</a>: Then a councillor can say, this is my issue and adopt it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7633.438s">[Knight]</a>: And then they can take ownership of the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7635.218s">[Knight]</a>: You know, instead of having someone comes up to the podium and we're going to have the seven competing people step over each other to see who's going to do the most with this person when we're all here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7642.782s">[Knight]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7643.863s">[Knight]</a>: At the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7644.663s">[Knight]</a>: And then it dies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7645.564s">[Knight]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7646.584s">[Knight]</a>: We can take ownership of the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7647.705s">[Knight]</a>: We can say, hey, look.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7648.725s">[Knight]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7649.606s">[Knight]</a>: I put this proposal forward on behalf of Mr. Krause to get $15,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7653.188s">[Knight]</a>: I'm going to get him the answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7654.649s">[Knight]</a>: As opposed to, oh, that's a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7655.93s">[Knight]</a>: This person was up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7656.61s">[Knight]</a>: I agree with this person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7657.37s">[Knight]</a>: I agree with that person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7658.291s">[Knight]</a>: Send it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7658.911s">[Knight]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7659.432s">[Knight]</a>: Send it to the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7660.732s">[Knight]</a>: I just think it streamlines the process a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7671.62s">[Knight]</a>: I think independently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7672.481s">[Knight]</a>: We're a body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7676.885s">[Knight]</a>: I think I'm an individual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7678.446s">[Knight]</a>: I'm a member of this body, but I think as an individual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7896.417s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7897.758s">[Knight]</a>: I echo Councilor Caraviello's sentiments regarding Mrs. Moss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7902.62s">[Knight]</a>: I have the good fortune of being very close friends with Hank and Dennis, and they're two of the finest individuals you'll ever meet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7909.223s">[Knight]</a>: And their mom did a great job raising them as a father of two sons, I hope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7914.077s">[Knight]</a>: and pray that when my kids reach adulthood that they are of the same character and integrity that Hank and Dennis have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7920.379s">[Knight]</a>: They're two great individuals and they're a certain and absolute reflection of the work that their parents put in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7926.68s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, I just want to join Councilor Caraviello and hopefully my council colleagues in extending a deep and sincere condolence to the Morse family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7935.863s">[Knight]</a>: Priscilla will be sadly missed and she did a lot of good for this community and that good carries on in her children and grandchildren.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7942.955s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd ask that my council colleagues join me in supporting this measure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8104.449s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8105.83s">[Knight]</a>: This is a relatively self-explanatory proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8109.072s">[Knight]</a>: I'd like to refer this to the city solicitor for validation of form and codification, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8113.794s">[Knight]</a>: Where we're going to put it in the ordinance isn't to be sure that it's in proper form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8117.356s">[Knight]</a>: However, in looking at it, ultimately, there's been a fight for 15 across the country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8122.719s">[Knight]</a>: To live in the city of Medford and make less than $15, you're not going to be able to make it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8127.199s">[Knight]</a>: to live in the city of Medford and make $15.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8128.7s">[Knight]</a>: You're going to have $15 now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8130.001s">[Knight]</a>: You're going to have a very difficult time trying to make it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8132.783s">[Knight]</a>: This is an opportunity for us to show that we value our employees, that we believe in the work that they do, that we feel as though our public servants provide a high-quality level of service to the community, and they should be compensated accordingly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8145.651s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, I raise this measure and bring it forward for further debate and discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8150.695s">[Knight]</a>: I'd like to ask that the city solicitor put this in proper form and codification, and then we can, again, reconvene on it upon conclusion of legal review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8211.743s">[Knight]</a>: Lifeguards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8213.905s">[Knight]</a>: Camp Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8215.526s">[Knight]</a>: Park police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8216.907s">[Knight]</a>: Substitute teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8218.268s">[Knight]</a>: These are the people that will be impacted and affected by this, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8221.05s">[Knight]</a>: People that provide a very valuable service to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8225.173s">[Knight]</a>: We talk about lifeguards, it writes point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8229.158s">[Knight]</a>: pretty happy to say that I haven't heard about any type of situation up at Wright's Pond in a very long time, because we do a great job training our lifeguards up there, and we have full complement to staff, and we want to keep it that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8241.769s">[Knight]</a>: We talk about the parks police, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8244.171s">[Knight]</a>: You know, I can remember a time when I was a child where the parks were crazy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8249.596s">[Knight]</a>: When the sun went down, the parks turned into war zones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8252.499s">[Knight]</a>: And now, as you drive through the city and you see the parks in the summertime and the park police are on board,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8258.311s">[Knight]</a>: We're not seeing those same problems that we used to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8260.873s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, I just think it's very important to point out who would be impacted and affected by this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8265.275s">[Knight]</a>: It's only city and school department employees, and it's only ones that make less than $15 an hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8271.218s">[Knight]</a>: During budget deliberations and over the course of the past term, all of the collective bargaining agreements in both the school department and the city side, at one point or another, reached a conclusion and got wrapped up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8282.21s">[Knight]</a>: all contractual employees were receiving a wage that was above $15 an hour, with the exception of those few that I've just mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8289.334s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, I don't think this is gonna be something that's gonna have a major impact on the bottom line, but it will certainly have a major impact on the lives of those individuals that are working here and the employee of the city of Medford, and they're gonna be benefits of a fair wage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8325.324s">[Knight]</a>: If the Massachusetts minimum wage exceeds $15 an hour, then the employee shall receive the Massachusetts minimum hourly wage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8331.629s">[Knight]</a>: So as the state sets it is how our employees will get it based upon this proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8346.7s">[Knight]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8347.2s">[Knight]</a>: We're going to let the state dictate and we're going to follow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8375.154s">[Knight]</a>: Referral to the solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8466.15s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8467.391s">[Knight]</a>: I find this to be a rather self-explanatory resolution, ordinance change rather.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8471.854s">[Knight]</a>: In looking at it for my council colleagues, the language in bold would be the new language being added to the existing section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8479.24s">[Knight]</a>: The remaining language in the section would continue to remain in full force and effect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8485.044s">[Knight]</a>: A few weeks back, we had some discussion about the removal of a number of parking spots along High Street and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8491.929s">[Knight]</a>: discussing the issue with residents in the neighborhood that were impacted by it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8495.434s">[Knight]</a>: I thought this might be an interesting compromise, a way that we could address some of the neighborhood concerns, but also move forward with the project, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8502.645s">[Knight]</a>: Now with that being said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8504.591s">[Knight]</a>: I would request that this paper be sent to the building commissioner as well as the code enforcement officer for review and recommendation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8511.394s">[Knight]</a>: Where it's a zoning ordinance, it does have further ramifications than just this 94-151 section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8518.757s">[Knight]</a>: I know that there's another section on zoning code that talks about what a suitable parking spot would be and what the parameters of that parking spot would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8526.42s">[Knight]</a>: had conversation with John Bovuso from the building commissioner's office and he's asked for the opportunity to take a look at this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8533.365s">[Knight]</a>: So I'm requesting that my council colleagues join me in moving forward with sending this to the building commissioner's office for review from the building commissioner and the code enforcement officer for recommendations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8542.431s">[Knight]</a>: And then we can have a future discussion on it after those come back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8773.802s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8774.782s">[Knight]</a>: May I be so bold, Mr. President, to amend the paper to request that in the discernment, the building department also look at the green space requirements associated with intercourt parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8785.99s">[Knight]</a>: And I offer that in the form of an amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8789.832s">[Knight]</a>: That the Building Commissioner's Office also review during the discernment the green space requirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9231.803s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9232.983s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9234.804s">[Knight]</a>: This has been something that we've been kicking around now for what seems like four and a half, maybe five years, where the mayor's taken a public position that she's going to be recusing herself from the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9245.306s">[Knight]</a>: We have a zoning subcommittee that's ready, willing, and able to finish up the draft and bring it forward to the committee of the whole for future deliberations and discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9254.429s">[Knight]</a>: So I'd ask that the council colleagues support this resolution in moving forward with the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9879.215s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. Cruz, Mr. President, I'd like to call the meeting to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=11135.231s">[Knight]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=11137.092s">[Knight]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=11137.272s">[Knight]</a>: In favor of the paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=11149.275s">[Knight]</a>: It seems like the gentleman's causing quite a disruption to our citizens.<br><br>
