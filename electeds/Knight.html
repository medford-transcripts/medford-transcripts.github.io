    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=511.069s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=511.99s">[Knight]</a>: Um, Mr. President, uh, this is the first I've heard of the city receiving a grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=515.052s">[Knight]</a>: Could the councilor tell us a little bit about what this grant is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=518.594s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Locren.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=609.467s">[Knight]</a>: Yes, and the vote is to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=687.104s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Dela Rousseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=689.886s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=691.312s">[Knight]</a>: 7 in the affirmative, none in the negative motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=6125.202s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, on page 223, there is item 17689, amendment B, Councilor Locksmith and Councilor Scott-Bell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=6127.483s">[Knight]</a>: I do not change the record as amended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1194.829s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1195.77s">[Knight]</a>: Um, Mr. President, uh, this is the first I've heard of the city receiving a grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1198.812s">[Knight]</a>: Could the councilor tell us a little bit about what this grant is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1202.354s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Locren.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1203.355s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=436.301s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=438.362s">[Knight]</a>: Looking back in the newspaper over the summer, I think if we all recall a police standoff up in Saugus along Route 1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=446.348s">[Knight]</a>: And what happened was the gentleman had made his way into a Dick's Sporting Goods up in Route 1 and got his hands on some firearms, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=453.152s">[Knight]</a>: And this resulted in a police standoff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=454.973s">[Knight]</a>: They closed down Route 1 for a number of hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=457.535s">[Knight]</a>: Recently in our community, we were very lucky to open up a Dick's Sporting Goods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=461.187s">[Knight]</a>: And this Dick's Sporting Goods is a great, great facility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=464.771s">[Knight]</a>: However, they do sell some questionable material that I don't personally support, which would be firearms, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=470.276s">[Knight]</a>: But this is in no way, shape, or form an attempt to push back on people's Second Amendment rights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=475.521s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, what it is is an effort to regulate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=480.168s">[Knight]</a>: The safe storage and sale and display of firearms, ammunition, and firearm accessories in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=486.709s">[Knight]</a>: You know, the cat's out of the barn, the horse is out of the barn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=489.05s">[Knight]</a>: We have a facility here in the community that's selling firearms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=491.731s">[Knight]</a>: I think it's incumbent upon us as a council to take all the steps that are necessary to ensure that we maintain that the community remains safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=498.172s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, I bring this forward as a conversation starter, a spot for us to jump off from a launching pad, if you want to call it that, for us to start this discussion and have this conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=508.317s">[Knight]</a>: Um, so with that being said, Mr. President asked my council colleagues to support the measure and move for approvals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=582.915s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=584.516s">[Knight]</a>: This paper here is paper 17752, which reads, be it resolved the city administration refund taxpayers all convenience fees incurred during the current fiscal year as a result of the online payment of tax bills issued by the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=597.704s">[Knight]</a>: And be it further resolved that the city administration take the necessary steps to eliminate or assume such fees going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=604.108s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I've run into several situations, gotten several phone calls, bumped into people that have attempted to pay their property tax bills online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=611.738s">[Knight]</a>: And when they go in there to pay their property tax bill, they are assessed a convenience fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=617.325s">[Knight]</a>: The last one that I heard was upwards of close to $50, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=620.849s">[Knight]</a>: And that doesn't sound too convenient to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=622.43s">[Knight]</a>: We're sitting here in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=623.731s">[Knight]</a>: We're asking robocalls to go out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=625.112s">[Knight]</a>: We're asking things to get posted on the website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=626.734s">[Knight]</a>: We're asking people to utilize technology more and more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=629.956s">[Knight]</a>: We shouldn't be charging them to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=631.357s">[Knight]</a>: We should be encouraging it, not discouraging it, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=633.859s">[Knight]</a>: So I'm asking that the administration look into this and to take the appropriate steps to either waive the fee, assume the fee, or eliminate the fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=713.109s">[Knight]</a>: I certainly have no problem with that, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=714.91s">[Knight]</a>: If we're going to take a vote, I want it to be an informed vote, and I want everybody behind the rail to be comfortable with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=719.894s">[Knight]</a>: With that being said, I'd be happy to even withhold the request until we have the presentation from the treasurer or the financial director, whatever the council feels comfortable with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=729.802s">[Knight]</a>: Again, I just think this is an opportunity for us to get... They can be simultaneous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=742.285s">[Knight]</a>: We can do that too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=749.567s">[Knight]</a>: That's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=750.307s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, my motion is to have it passed, but, um, you know, go to the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=754.508s">[Knight]</a>: But if the council has questions, then I have no problem, um, going along with whatever it is that it will take to make sure that this comes to fruition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=767.264s">[Knight]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=769.525s">[Knight]</a>: Did you amend it, Councilor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2576.523s">[Knight]</a>: report due here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2578.124s">[Knight]</a>: It looks like the next report for the university accountability ordinance would be due November, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2584.026s">[Knight]</a>: If we could mark that up for a... It's come and gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2590.529s">[Knight]</a>: So maybe we can mark that up to make sure that we get a report back from our code enforcement officer to make sure that there have been no complaints filed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2596.991s">[Knight]</a>: We can, Mr. Clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=861.345s">[Knight]</a>: Councillor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=862.325s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=863.606s">[Knight]</a>: I think we're all in agreement that we understand and value the importance of a bus shelter, especially at this location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=868.849s">[Knight]</a>: And the task that's before us here is how are we going to get it put there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=872.601s">[Knight]</a>: And Councilman Scott Pelley made a great recommendation to send it to the MBTA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=876.124s">[Knight]</a>: I'd like to amend the paper and also have it sent to the administration, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=879.747s">[Knight]</a>: And I'd like to ask the administration to discuss mitigation strategies in relation to the number of mass DOT projects that are going on in the community to help fund this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=888.792s">[Knight]</a>: some impact going on with the erection of the cell phone towers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=892.195s">[Knight]</a>: We have some impact going on with the extension of the Green Line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=895.158s">[Knight]</a>: We have some impact going on with the development of the Craddock Bridge that are all under MassDOT control, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=900.623s">[Knight]</a>: And it's not unusual when projects are going on in communities that mitigation of this sort is extended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=905.487s">[Knight]</a>: So I'd also like to ask that the paper be sent to the administration with the request that they discuss mitigation with the MassDOT to provide funding or construction of such.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1137.982s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1138.523s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1138.783s">[Knight]</a>: Also where the MBTA is a quasi public agency underneath the mass dot umbrella.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1142.765s">[Knight]</a>: I think it will be appropriate to amend the paper further and ask that this also be sent to a state delegation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1147.008s">[Knight]</a>: So they're aware of the request that the council's making.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1570.726s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1571.727s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1573.948s">[Knight]</a>: When it comes to municipal aggregation, this is a topic that I think we've been discussing now for over a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1578.671s">[Knight]</a>: And quite frankly, the ball's in the council's court to determine whether or not this is something that we're going to allow the city to explore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1585.596s">[Knight]</a>: And again, I think the time to move forward on it is now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1589.238s">[Knight]</a>: Ultimately, the question is, do we want<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1591.209s">[Knight]</a>: to request the department head to dedicate resources to something that hasn't been approved yet by this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1597.394s">[Knight]</a>: We're asking a department head to say, start creating a list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1600.057s">[Knight]</a>: We may or may not adopt municipal aggregation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1603.66s">[Knight]</a>: And I think we're putting the cart before the horse, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1605.522s">[Knight]</a>: If we want to explore municipal aggregation, let's explore municipal aggregation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1608.284s">[Knight]</a>: Let's take the vote and let's allow it to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1611.647s">[Knight]</a>: But to dedicate resources to something that may or may not happen, I don't feel comfortable doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1618.003s">[Knight]</a>: the Director of Energy and Environment to start to begin to create an opt-out list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1622.204s">[Knight]</a>: So she's going to dedicate resources in her office towards something that we may not adopt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1628.226s">[Knight]</a>: So I think that this might be a little bit counterintuitive at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1631.547s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I'll have a difficult time supporting it this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2732.927s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Neistat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2733.848s">[Knight]</a>: So this is, Mr. President, when we met with Evisuos, one of the things that Councilor Marks brought up was that there's a memorandum of understanding that was negotiated for mitigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2743.814s">[Knight]</a>: And that this isn't related to that meeting then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2745.555s">[Knight]</a>: Because one of the requests that Councilor Marks made was that the items that were brought to the table and denied, we wanted to know what those were as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2751.919s">[Knight]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2752.279s">[Knight]</a>: So this is for the previous meeting, not the meeting that we just had the other day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2755.461s">[Knight]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2755.561s">[Knight]</a>: Sounds good to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2820.42s">[Knight]</a>: If I may, Mr. President, I think the best approach would be to send it to Mr. Zamparelli from Eversource, who's the government relations person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2835.101s">[Knight]</a>: I believe I still have the floor, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2837.263s">[Knight]</a>: I'm sorry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2837.764s">[Knight]</a>: I believe I still have the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2838.845s">[Knight]</a>: I'm sorry, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2840.186s">[Knight]</a>: So we negotiated a memorandum of understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2841.888s">[Knight]</a>: And as I understand the process, based upon my discussions, is that the Department of Public Utilities has approved the project's specifications in terms of the cost, the route.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2853.876s">[Knight]</a>: the stretch that it's going to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2855.477s">[Knight]</a>: And the MOU was negotiated between the chief negotiator and the utility company for mitigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2861.842s">[Knight]</a>: And what comes before us is the grant for access for right away to put the vaults in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2866.385s">[Knight]</a>: If we fail to approve those vaults, then the next step in the process would be that Eversource would appeal to the Department of Public Utilities because they're the ones that approved the project plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2875.992s">[Knight]</a>: And then the question comes as to whether or not DPU agrees to allow them to proceed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2882.063s">[Knight]</a>: And if they do, then the terms of the MOU, I believe, become null and void.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2886.088s">[Knight]</a>: So that's a concern that we have as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2887.55s">[Knight]</a>: So I think that that's something that we need to ask the city solicitor at the next meeting is whether or not the terms of the MOU become null and void if the grants right away aren't approved and DPU has to step in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4306.174s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4307.45s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4308.871s">[Knight]</a>: I can certainly agree with my colleagues that there are many needs in this community, and prioritizing these needs are vital.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4315.795s">[Knight]</a>: And that's why we get elected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4319.817s">[Knight]</a>: The redevelopment of the Carriage House and the creation of the Shepard Brooks Estates to be a full-fledged function hall was part of the chart the course plan that was presented by Mayor McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4331.623s">[Knight]</a>: It was the last item that came before this council as part of the chart the course plan, and the council voted it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4338.604s">[Knight]</a>: After the council voted the plan down, Mr. President, about a year passed and the members of the Medford Brooks Estate Land Trust came to the council and said, the carriage house is the key focal piece of our master plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4349.329s">[Knight]</a>: Regardless of whether or not the council supports the master plan, the carriage house is the key focus of their master plan and what direction they want to go in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4355.532s">[Knight]</a>: They want to utilize the carriage house in the area that the carriage house is on to make an economic catalyst for the Sheppard Brooks Estates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4363.326s">[Knight]</a>: And they came before us and they asked for this money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4365.087s">[Knight]</a>: And we had a committee of the whole with Paul Mulkey and they had people come in and they had people do an assessment of this carriage house and tell us what it was gonna cost to tie it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4373.19s">[Knight]</a>: And we had a committee of the whole on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4375.471s">[Knight]</a>: And that was all we had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4377.492s">[Knight]</a>: And now here we are, a winter's past, another winter's coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4381.054s">[Knight]</a>: And the individuals at Shepherd Brooks Estates are here before us again this evening asking us for $200,000 to shore up the key piece and the key component of their master plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4393.467s">[Knight]</a>: Regardless of whether or not we support the master plan, Mr. President, the carriage house is an essential part of the redevelopment of that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4401.176s">[Knight]</a>: The carriage house is the catalyst.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4403.959s">[Knight]</a>: The carriage house is also falling apart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4405.882s">[Knight]</a>: It's a disgrace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4406.683s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, any one of us could go up there and if we look at it, it's not a carriage house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4409.786s">[Knight]</a>: It's a shell of a building that's falling apart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4412.497s">[Knight]</a>: But that shell of a building does have historic significance, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4415.579s">[Knight]</a>: Week in, week out, we talk about historic preservation, demolition delay, historic significance, historic districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4422.723s">[Knight]</a>: This is one of the most historic homes, I should say, because we do have the Royal House, we do have the Peter Tufts House, we do have some very historic properties in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4429.066s">[Knight]</a>: But this is by far the most beautiful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4430.847s">[Knight]</a>: It's got 50 acres of land that surround it, and there are many opportunities and options up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4434.91s">[Knight]</a>: And I think one thing that we need to do is preserve the carriage house, because maybe, although we don't agree with the master plan,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4439.775s">[Knight]</a>: I think we can all agree that the Carriage House is a vital component to what's going on up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4444.176s">[Knight]</a>: There are many options and many opportunities for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4446.017s">[Knight]</a>: And we might have to go back to the drawing board on this master plan because the council hasn't funded it in the past and they may not fund it again in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4451.099s">[Knight]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4452.219s">[Knight]</a>: But what I do know is this, the Carriage House is vital to the economic success at that location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4456.861s">[Knight]</a>: And this evening I'm comfortable supporting a $200,000 free cash appropriation based upon the history and based upon the presentation that was given to us in the past, the presentation that was given to us last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4468.445s">[Knight]</a>: And quite frankly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4469.741s">[Knight]</a>: the vital need that we have in Sheppard Brooks Estates if we're going to turn it into an economic catalyst to maintain the carriage house, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4474.982s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, um, I'm supportive of the paper this evening and I move for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=200.716s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=202.097s">[Knight]</a>: I think Councilor Scott Pelli has got great timing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=206.359s">[Knight]</a>: Just a couple of weeks ago, our zoning subcommittee met under the direction of Chairman Falco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=210.42s">[Knight]</a>: And one of the topics that we discussed in that meeting was inclusionary housing and inclusionary zoning ordinance, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=216.143s">[Knight]</a>: And I think it's the time right now is to really address the issue that we have here in the city of Medford or affordable housing or the lack thereof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=222.998s">[Knight]</a>: And one of the focuses that we've had is obviously meeting the threshold that's established by the state of 10%, but also retaining and replacing the expiring new stock of affordable housing units in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=233.705s">[Knight]</a>: This is something that I wholeheartedly support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=235.226s">[Knight]</a>: I thank Councilor Scott Pelly for bringing it forward, and I look forward to working with him towards a finished product.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=371.118s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=372.419s">[Knight]</a>: I'd like to amend the paper with a B paper and request that the administration report back to the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=378.25s">[Knight]</a>: What the process is for permitting fields at this point in time, Mr. President, usually it goes before the parks board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=383.415s">[Knight]</a>: The parks board meets once a month when they have a quorum, and then permits are issued.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=387.078s">[Knight]</a>: And I don't think it's the most effective or efficient process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=389.78s">[Knight]</a>: Here we have a recreation department with a budget of $315,000 annually that hopefully will be up and running sometime soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=396.966s">[Knight]</a>: And the way that we're permitting our fields I don't think is going to be conducive to the best use and the best possible practices that we can do at the municipal level, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=403.561s">[Knight]</a>: So I'm asking that the administration conduct a review of the permitting process for their fields and provide recommendations as to how we can improve that to maybe a weekly permitting process as opposed to a monthly permitting process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=412.743s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=569.626s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=570.607s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Nice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=571.54s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=572.88s">[Knight]</a>: I just want to congratulate Justin on taking over the family business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=576.501s">[Knight]</a>: We've seen his father in there and grandfather Paul before that, one of the great basketball players of Carpark history and Carpark folklore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=584.622s">[Knight]</a>: Justin, same type of business, same type of, just a new name?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=588.803s">[Knight]</a>: Just a new name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=589.663s">[Knight]</a>: All right, excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=590.183s">[Knight]</a>: Well, I wish you the best of luck and congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=704.742s">[Knight]</a>: President, I move for adoption of the committee report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=751.369s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=752.749s">[Knight]</a>: With a recent school place shooting taking place, Councillor Scott Pelley and I were having a conversation about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=758.049s">[Knight]</a>: the tragic situations that's happened in America here when it comes to gun control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=761.314s">[Knight]</a>: And one of the questions that came up was, are we doing enough in our public buildings to keep our employees safe?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=767.283s">[Knight]</a>: Then this evening when we got here, it's been brought to my attention, Mr. President, that there was a little bit of a situation in our public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=774.322s">[Knight]</a>: over the past week or so, month or so, I should say, that's been brought to our attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=779.725s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, I move for approval on the underlying resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=783.307s">[Knight]</a>: I'm sure there are many individuals in the audience and they would like to come up and speak on the topic of what happened at our schools today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=788.649s">[Knight]</a>: We can keep them as separate issues and open that up to public participation and move for approval on the paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=793.651s">[Knight]</a>: And let me-.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3546.87s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much, and Mr. Belson, thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3549.692s">[Knight]</a>: I appreciate your being so candid with the situation and accepting responsibility for what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3557.078s">[Knight]</a>: With that being said, when will the investigation be complete?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3611.353s">[Knight]</a>: Superintendent Belson, now we have the STARS program, and what would the normal reporting process be in the STARS program if a situation like this occurred?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3748.448s">[Knight]</a>: I was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3749.588s">[Knight]</a>: I was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3793.568s">[Knight]</a>: And Mr. Belson, if this incident had occurred when school was in session, what would the response have been?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3808.577s">[Knight]</a>: In terms of identifying failures in the reporting system, I think that this has been opened up as a failure in the reporting structure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3815.581s">[Knight]</a>: And where's the biggest failure that you've identified thus far in terms of the reporting structure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3819.683s">[Knight]</a>: Is it between the cleaning contact crack to giving it to the senior custodian, the senior custodian not reporting it to the principal appropriately?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3837.805s">[Knight]</a>: And I guess the next question is, what are the next steps that we can hear from so that we can be assured that this isn't going to happen again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3884.684s">[Knight]</a>: Do you have any knowledge as to whether or not the school committee is going to continue to allow rental opportunities to outside organizations in our schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3890.508s">[Knight]</a>: Is this something they're going to be looking at from a policy standpoint?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3929.337s">[Knight]</a>: No, and I'm not asking for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3931.178s">[Knight]</a>: I don't want to see a knee-jerk reaction to address an issue in the community that I think needs a long hard look.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3939.402s">[Knight]</a>: And I can certainly appreciate how candid you are this evening, and thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3943.145s">[Knight]</a>: That does it for my questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3944.626s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5396.078s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5396.858s">[Knight]</a>: Counselor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5397.859s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I just ask that we request, um, upon the conclusion of the investigation, a copy of the investigative report, uh, the findings thereof and any remedial action that may or may not be taken, um, after the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5411.109s">[Knight]</a>: investigation is completed for our review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5413.59s">[Knight]</a>: If that material is not available to us for privacy reasons or whatever, I would ask that a presentation be made to a committee of the whole so that we can go over that and hear what happens at the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5424.732s">[Knight]</a>: We're at the beginning right now, Mr. President, but I'd like to come full circle on this and see some type of closure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5429.233s">[Knight]</a>: So I'd like to get a better understanding as to what happens once the investigation is over and what steps going forward are going to be taken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5435.994s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5436.857s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor DelaRusso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8831.816s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, this evening the Subcommittee on Ordinances met to discuss an ordinance regulating short-term rentals, also more familiarly known as Airbnb or vacation rental by owner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8843.879s">[Knight]</a>: The subcommittee has put together a group of key priorities that we'd like to see drafted into an ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8850.761s">[Knight]</a>: Copies of these key priorities have been distributed to the membership as well as the city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8857.123s">[Knight]</a>: Subcommittee had voted to move this paper forward favorably to a committee of the whole With the request that the city solicitor put a draft ordinance together for us to further deliberate and discuss move for approval the committee report Paper 17 542 16<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8881.832s">[Knight]</a>: Oh, we, we, we, yeah, the 2016.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8893.4s">[Knight]</a>: We did that already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8948.217s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8948.657s">[Knight]</a>: Counselor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8949.697s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I'd like the record to reflect that I recuse myself from voting on this subject matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9267.432s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, the question that I asked the city solicitor was because we had an existing ordinance in place that exempted private clubs from the public smoking ban, how could the board of health pass a regulation that would be contrary to the ordinance that the legislative body had passed in 2007?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9285.525s">[Knight]</a>: So my question was whether or not the process and procedure was appropriate and whether or not the board of health had the authority to make the unilateral heavy handed action that they made and they do not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9294.861s">[Knight]</a>: This issue has to come back to the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9296.844s">[Knight]</a>: If we want to allow smoking in private clubs right now, it is authorized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9301.03s">[Knight]</a>: If we want to ban that, that is a matter that has to come before the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9303.834s">[Knight]</a>: It's a legislative affair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9304.996s">[Knight]</a>: It's not something that can be done regulatory, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9307.579s">[Knight]</a>: So my concern was that when this was implemented, it was implemented inappropriately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9312.529s">[Knight]</a>: And I think that the city solicitor concurs with my opinion, and I also think that his opinion wasn't requested when the Board of Health went forward and made this action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9321.651s">[Knight]</a>: So, in an effort to make sure that everything was done above bar, Mr. President, to be sure that we were in compliance with the law, I asked the question to the solicitor as to whether or not this process was handled appropriately, and whether or not the Board of Health had the authority to do it, because there was an existing statute in place already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9533.638s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I think it's also important to point out nothing in our ordinance requires private clubs to allow smoking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9539.842s">[Knight]</a>: And the exemption only exempts private clubs from the public smoking ban, but it doesn't say that they don't have the ability to police themselves either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9548.688s">[Knight]</a>: So I certainly understand Firefighter Brennan's, Captain Brennan's position on the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9553.411s">[Knight]</a>: I don't particularly care for smoking in places either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9556.353s">[Knight]</a>: However, my concern when I brought the question forward was whether or not it was handled appropriately and whether or not it was done within a fashion that was in the scope of their authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4562.069s">[Knight]</a>: No, I'd like to know why we still haven't received one copy of one Warren article since January of 2020, 2021 now, 2021.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4574.838s">[Knight]</a>: We have not received one copy of one Warren article.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4577.099s">[Knight]</a>: You sat here before this body and put a budget presentation on and we made it pretty darn clear<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4583.814s">[Knight]</a>: that we want this document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4585.475s">[Knight]</a>: This council has passed countless resolutions saying we want this document, yet your office has failed to provide it time and time again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4594.261s">[Knight]</a>: Now, Bob, I know you're new to the city and, you know, at some point you got to say, I'm not blaming you, but now I am blaming you because you sat here before us in June when we asked for this document, we still haven't received it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4606.949s">[Knight]</a>: The council has taken numerous votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4608.61s">[Knight]</a>: The mayor's office has said, refer it to the finance director in a response to this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4612.705s">[Knight]</a>: but we still haven't received it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4614.526s">[Knight]</a>: Why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4625.251s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, is this a for real story right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4627.532s">[Knight]</a>: This is a for real story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4628.833s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, literally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4630.253s">[Knight]</a>: After a year and a half of waiting for this document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4635.356s">[Knight]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4636.636s">[Knight]</a>: We've been asking for this document for a year and a half and he goes, what are you asking for now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4640.885s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, is this- I understand the frustration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4642.947s">[Knight]</a>: No, this isn't even about frustration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4644.288s">[Knight]</a>: It's about a waste of my goddamn time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4646.57s">[Knight]</a>: All right, that's what this is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4647.851s">[Knight]</a>: All right, it's a waste.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4648.772s">[Knight]</a>: It's a waste of all of our time to come up here and be pranced around like dog and pony.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4657.62s">[Knight]</a>: To be pranced around like dog and pony.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4661.564s">[Knight]</a>: They're not passed by this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4725.1s">[Knight]</a>: What are we looking for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4730.942s">[Knight]</a>: I want to know how much money KP Law has received in the past year, for example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4735.063s">[Knight]</a>: So I can take a look at the Warren articles and I can say, oh, geez, we have a budget in the law department that says they're going to spend $200,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4741.526s">[Knight]</a>: But I'm looking here, in the last six months, we've spent $1.7 million at KP Law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4746.127s">[Knight]</a>: Why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4746.747s">[Knight]</a>: And I can get ahead of some of these issues so that come the budget in probably, well, we'll get it, what, maybe June 30th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4753.089s">[Knight]</a>: When we get to June 30th for, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4755.404s">[Knight]</a>: July 1st vote, I might be able to have a little bit of understanding as to why we're in the situation we're in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4788.064s">[Knight]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4789.528s">[Knight]</a>: Now I understand exactly what you're looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4791.869s">[Knight]</a>: And I'm sorry to take my frustration out on you, but there's a mayor in this, there's a mayor in this building, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4796.911s">[Knight]</a>: And we send these papers to her and they just sit there and they don't move.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4800.473s">[Knight]</a>: They just sit on the desk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4801.353s">[Knight]</a>: All right, so I show up here and I try to do my job as hard as I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4805.575s">[Knight]</a>: I try, I really do, but I can't do it if I don't have the tools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4808.796s">[Knight]</a>: I can't build a household as small.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4835.943s">[Knight]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4836.403s">[Knight]</a>: Has the chief of staff ever called you and said, this is what they're looking for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4844.15s">[Knight]</a>: Has the law department ever called you and said, the city council has asked us to draft an ordinance<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4849.991s">[Knight]</a>: This is what they're looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4853.112s">[Knight]</a>: So the law department hasn't called you, the chief of staff hasn't called you, and the mayor's office hasn't called you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4857.173s">[Knight]</a>: But this council's taking at least a dozen affirmative votes to get this information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4884.023s">[Knight]</a>: Yeah, and just to just to clarify, I feel bad that they said you already had a falling assortment be a sacrificial lamb.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5092.201s">[Knight]</a>: It might also be helpful to go talk to the city clerk and say, hey, can I see a copy of the council tracking sheet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5340.994s">[Knight]</a>: I'm just curious if a rank and file employee say in the Medford DPW for a year and a half failed to provide you with information that you requested, what would happen to them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5370.205s">[Knight]</a>: even when it's clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6772.423s">[Knight]</a>: First of all, I'd like to thank Councilor Scott Pelley and Councilor Caviello for being outspoken in their efforts to raise awareness as to what's going on in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6785.832s">[Knight]</a>: Neither one of these gentlemen were required to appear for the school committee meeting last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6791.836s">[Knight]</a>: They did so as concerned parents, grandparents, and public servants here in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6800.981s">[Knight]</a>: And when I listen to what they say, and I listen to what people on the street say, and when I listen to what my kids say, and I listen to what my wife has to say about these public schools as an educator at 25 years in a neighboring school district, it doesn't make me feel good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6823.567s">[Knight]</a>: I feel as though we're failing our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6827.435s">[Knight]</a>: We're feeling the most vulnerable members of our population, our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6837.657s">[Knight]</a>: He said, it's the one-year anniversary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6840.018s">[Knight]</a>: I said, one-year anniversary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6840.958s">[Knight]</a>: Are you talking one-year anniversary or what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6843.419s">[Knight]</a>: One-year anniversary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6844.119s">[Knight]</a>: It's December.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6845.479s">[Knight]</a>: Christmas hasn't happened yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6846.439s">[Knight]</a>: I go, one-year anniversary or what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6848.22s">[Knight]</a>: He goes, no, you don't remember the two walkouts that happened last year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6854.261s">[Knight]</a>: The two walkouts at Medford High School that happened last year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6857.717s">[Knight]</a>: because of escalating violence in our public schools, when hundreds of children, hundreds of our students, our kids, our neighbors' children, our families got up out of their seats and they walked out of the school because they said, we can't take it anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6900.86s">[Knight]</a>: And I think we all know what happens when kids become afraid to go to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6905.904s">[Knight]</a>: We've all seen the documentaries on how gangs are formed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6909.187s">[Knight]</a>: We've all heard the stories about kids that get bullied in school and then decide to bring weapons because they've had enough and shoot up schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6923.034s">[Knight]</a>: Why do we feel as though we're impervious to the same situation or the same circumstances?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6929.159s">[Knight]</a>: Because we're not, we're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6932.861s">[Knight]</a>: So we're in a place where kids are afraid to go to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6936.303s">[Knight]</a>: And we're also in a place where we see embarrassing news story after embarrassing news story after embarrassing news story in the headlines with the word mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6947.52s">[Knight]</a>: And that's a shame because the city is better than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6971.854s">[Knight]</a>: And we can all sit here and we can say, this isn't right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6973.575s">[Knight]</a>: And this isn't wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6975.336s">[Knight]</a>: but the data doesn't lie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6976.677s">[Knight]</a>: The numbers don't lie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6978.337s">[Knight]</a>: So let's talk about the numbers a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6980.998s">[Knight]</a>: Let's talk about the numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6983.259s">[Knight]</a>: 42% proficiency in math, 50% proficiency in reading, 240th in the state college readiness index, 181st in graduation rate, and 184th overall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6999.125s">[Knight]</a>: Our kids deserve better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7001.226s">[Knight]</a>: Our kids deserve better than what they're getting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7003.493s">[Knight]</a>: They don't deserve to go to school afraid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7006.414s">[Knight]</a>: They deserve to go to school with leaders that are willing to step up and accept the challenge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7013.436s">[Knight]</a>: Now, when this incident first happened, I got an email and the email spoke volumes in terms of the culture that's going on with this administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7024.199s">[Knight]</a>: And I have to take a look at it and just mention it because I think it really speaks volumes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7046.083s">[Knight]</a>: This is a confidential and urgent update relative to the circumstances at Medford High School from Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7054.208s">[Knight]</a>: MHS is currently in a stay-in-place due to a medical emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7059.864s">[Knight]</a>: A student was stabbed in the restroom and transported to MGH.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7062.785s">[Knight]</a>: Four students have been identified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7064.866s">[Knight]</a>: The police are here working with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7066.167s">[Knight]</a>: We're working on an official communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7069.429s">[Knight]</a>: What's that mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7070.769s">[Knight]</a>: We're working on an official communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7073.35s">[Knight]</a>: You shouldn't have to work on facts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7074.911s">[Knight]</a>: You shouldn't have to work on truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7076.732s">[Knight]</a>: You shouldn't have to work on anything other than telling the people what happened and what you're going to do to prevent it from happening again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7082.855s">[Knight]</a>: Here we are 60 days ago, two short months ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7088.057s">[Knight]</a>: Two short months ago, a girl was assaulted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7090.387s">[Knight]</a>: terribly assaulted, captured on video, broadcast all across the local news stations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7096.532s">[Knight]</a>: This poor girl has to go to school every day, shaking in her boots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7099.675s">[Knight]</a>: If it weren't for the strength of her parents, if it weren't for the strength of her parents coming up here week after week, day after day, fighting to raise awareness about these issues, it would have gone away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7113.966s">[Knight]</a>: And then 60 days later, we would have been talking about this gentleman that got assaulted and stabbed, and then it would have gone away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7121.104s">[Knight]</a>: And then 60 days later, something else would happen and we'd bring it up again and we'd start talking about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7126.806s">[Knight]</a>: Let's get serious about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7128.166s">[Knight]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7128.967s">[Knight]</a>: It's been a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7130.147s">[Knight]</a>: It's been a year since the students in that school told us they've had enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7134.008s">[Knight]</a>: It's been a year since they all got up out of their desks and had the courage to walk out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7137.81s">[Knight]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7150.558s">[Knight]</a>: because they're scared for their safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7153.78s">[Knight]</a>: This is sickening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7155.402s">[Knight]</a>: This is sickening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7156.783s">[Knight]</a>: And nothing anybody can say when they come up to this podium, all right, is gonna change the way I feel about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7162.948s">[Knight]</a>: The way it's been handled is horrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7165.369s">[Knight]</a>: Horrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7165.83s">[Knight]</a>: These aren't isolated incidents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7168.092s">[Knight]</a>: A year ago, one year ago, the whole school said we've had enough and they walked out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7172.975s">[Knight]</a>: This is not an isolated incident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7176.178s">[Knight]</a>: And the longer we keep approaching this situation as an isolated incident,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7181.069s">[Knight]</a>: The more isolated incidents are going to occur.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7185.572s">[Knight]</a>: And then when the budget comes around, we're going to hear the school department cry poor mouth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7189.694s">[Knight]</a>: Well, everybody wants to go to Minuteman and everybody wants to go to the charter school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7193.156s">[Knight]</a>: Well, yeah, no kidding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7194.457s">[Knight]</a>: Why wouldn't they?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7207.165s">[Knight]</a>: You can pay with peace of mind and financially send them to a school<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7211.374s">[Knight]</a>: where you feel as though they're going to be safe and you're going to receive what you deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7217.459s">[Knight]</a>: Or you can take the risks and send them to Medford High.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7220.621s">[Knight]</a>: And that's what parents are going to say to themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7222.142s">[Knight]</a>: They're going to say, is it worth it to me to spend this money to not have to put up with stuff like this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7227.306s">[Knight]</a>: And parents are going to say yes, because I'm a parent that's thinking about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7239.915s">[Knight]</a>: I hate to say it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7241.533s">[Knight]</a>: Because I went to the Hervey School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7244.355s">[Knight]</a>: I went to the Brooks School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7246.676s">[Knight]</a>: I went to the Hopps School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7248.357s">[Knight]</a>: I went to Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7250.178s">[Knight]</a>: I played sports for Bud Kelly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7252.139s">[Knight]</a>: I learned about what it's like to have blue and white in my veins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7255.061s">[Knight]</a>: I learned about what it's like to be responsible, to want to be someone that gives back to his community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7260.805s">[Knight]</a>: And that's why I chose to seek public office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7263.686s">[Knight]</a>: And when I sit here and I watch some of my colleagues in government hide under their desk, it infuriates me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7271.96s">[Knight]</a>: It's okay to say no sometimes, you know, and it's okay to say yes, but what you have to do is say something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7278.564s">[Knight]</a>: You can't stand for anything if you don't know where you stand and what you stand for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8802.441s">[Knight]</a>: Madam President, if I may.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8804.743s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8805.403s">[Knight]</a>: You know, there's no such thing as a utopian society.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8815.489s">[Knight]</a>: And I don't think in this instance that throwing money at an issue and quite frankly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8823.123s">[Knight]</a>: given the decision makers who aren't allocating funds properly in the first place, more money to spend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8831.25s">[Knight]</a>: I don't think this is going to do anything for those children that need to go to school tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8836.534s">[Knight]</a>: It might help in the long run, but it's not going to do anything for those children that need to go to school tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8851.025s">[Knight]</a>: As of right now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8852.895s">[Knight]</a>: The committee needs to live within its means because there is no funding request from the mayor before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8858.897s">[Knight]</a>: So we can jump up and down and say, we want more money, we want more money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8861.398s">[Knight]</a>: We do that every week about every issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8863.799s">[Knight]</a>: But ultimately right now, the administration hasn't put the paper before this body, which tells me the administration isn't taking it seriously, which would again, move me to the position to say, you have to live within your means and reallocate your funds then to address this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8878.605s">[Knight]</a>: So what's the plan and what are you going to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8881.141s">[Knight]</a>: And why are our kids going back to school tomorrow if you don't have a plan and you don't know what you're gonna do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8887.405s">[Knight]</a>: Quite frankly, I think the school should have been shut down until after Christmas vacation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8891.768s">[Knight]</a>: Blanket, sorry, high school's closed until after Christmas vacation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8895.691s">[Knight]</a>: In the interest of safety, in the interest of us showing this community that we're serious about the issues that are before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8901.674s">[Knight]</a>: Because a year has gone by and we haven't showed that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8907.938s">[Knight]</a>: So, you know, I'm certainly someone that recognizes that there's a need for resources, but I also think that there is room for reallocation of existing funds, existing policies, and existing practices that will improve the safety in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8938.473s">[Knight]</a>: But again, there's no such thing as a utopian society and there's never going to be enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8943.634s">[Knight]</a>: How much is enough?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8945.234s">[Knight]</a>: There's never going to be enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8946.815s">[Knight]</a>: There's never, we're never going to reach a point where you say, Oh, we're cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8949.175s">[Knight]</a>: This is good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8949.875s">[Knight]</a>: This is enough money for us to do whatever we need to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8952.396s">[Knight]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8952.736s">[Knight]</a>: That doesn't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8954.556s">[Knight]</a>: That doesn't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8955.376s">[Knight]</a>: Nobody says, I want to make less money next year than I made this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8958.657s">[Knight]</a>: That's just not the way it works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8960.537s">[Knight]</a>: So, you know, we can keep throwing money at issues or we can say, where are you allocating this money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8964.758s">[Knight]</a>: And is this a good plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8966.257s">[Knight]</a>: Because throwing money at issues doesn't do anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8967.978s">[Knight]</a>: It's not going to fix the problem if we're not spending it in the right place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8970.659s">[Knight]</a>: And it's clear that the money we've already provided isn't being spent in the right place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8974.581s">[Knight]</a>: So maybe it comes down to a reallocation plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8976.763s">[Knight]</a>: And then what can we do to supplement that reallocation plan, but let them live with the existing means that they have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8981.445s">[Knight]</a>: Because quite frankly, it seems like every time something comes up to just anything in this community, quite frankly, anytime anything comes up, it's we don't have any money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8988.889s">[Knight]</a>: We don't have any money to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8989.869s">[Knight]</a>: We don't have any money to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8992.011s">[Knight]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8992.311s">[Knight]</a>: Well, if you don't have any money to do it, it needs to get done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8994.212s">[Knight]</a>: Then what's the next thing you got to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8995.632s">[Knight]</a>: You got to reallocate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8996.832s">[Knight]</a>: You're going to change your game plan up a little bit there, folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8999.473s">[Knight]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9000.874s">[Knight]</a>: Bella check at halftime, you know, change the game plan, win the game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9004.294s">[Knight]</a>: We're not changing the game plan at halftime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9006.635s">[Knight]</a>: We're not taking a real strong self-assessment as to where we stand and then making adjustments to improve our position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9610.437s">[Knight]</a>: My understanding that the student was relatively new student in the school transfer student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9614.159s">[Knight]</a>: That's my understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9620.736s">[Knight]</a>: And do you feel as though this might be related to a bullying incident or something like that, an underlying bullying incident?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9626.18s">[Knight]</a>: What was the basis of the argument, the series of events or event that gave cause to arise to such an action?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9707.788s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9708.989s">[Knight]</a>: Could the student that stabbed the other student actually be let back into school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9713.513s">[Knight]</a>: Not according to the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9715.836s">[Knight]</a>: Is it the intention of the school administration to expel that student?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9724.023s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9724.324s">[Knight]</a>: I'm asking if the kid's getting expelled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9846.311s">[Knight]</a>: We all know each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10169.636s">[Knight]</a>: And I mean, I understand that, you know, violence happens in schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10175.883s">[Knight]</a>: Most high schools on the news every day, though, as I as this as is on the news every day, surrounding communities on the news every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10183.908s">[Knight]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10184.388s">[Knight]</a>: And don't make this about the Memphis City Council gets passionate about issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10187.329s">[Knight]</a>: So it's our fault that kids get stabbed in high school, because that's nonsense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10189.949s">[Knight]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10190.229s">[Knight]</a>: Because we don't make the policies up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10191.87s">[Knight]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10192.33s">[Knight]</a>: The school committee does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10193.19s">[Knight]</a>: They're the ones that set the policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10194.79s">[Knight]</a>: They're the ones that are responsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10203.552s">[Knight]</a>: Why are the 12 kids hanging out in the bathroom?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10216.061s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not trying to hold you accountable for the words you just said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10218.763s">[Knight]</a>: And I have the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10219.904s">[Knight]</a>: You don't have a point of information because you're not a counselor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10224.727s">[Knight]</a>: I'm finished, Madam President, because this is like ridiculous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10228.049s">[Knight]</a>: This is ridiculous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10228.73s">[Knight]</a>: So what's the plan going forward tomorrow when these kids go back to school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10232.472s">[Knight]</a>: How are they going to be safer than they were yesterday?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10236.655s">[Knight]</a>: Let's answer that question, because that's really what the people care about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10239.237s">[Knight]</a>: May I?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10288.602s">[Knight]</a>: And I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10289.303s">[Knight]</a>: And to all those people listening, when you go to the school committee, remember that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10337.645s">[Knight]</a>: But I just have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10338.566s">[Knight]</a>: How many of those administrators and other individuals that were deployed in the hallways that trained in safety training, trained in how to keep somebody safe?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10351.356s">[Knight]</a>: You keep piping in too, because I'm trying to figure that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10353.158s">[Knight]</a>: Everybody's interrupting each other, so maybe you should stop that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10418.614s">[Knight]</a>: I'm a little bit less concerned about the counseling of the traumatized bodies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10421.676s">[Knight]</a>: And I'm a little bit more concerned about how we're going to keep bodies safe from getting stabbed and beat up and fought and stuff like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10427.178s">[Knight]</a>: So obviously we've got a systemic problem there, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10430.82s">[Knight]</a>: These events are happening over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10434.982s">[Knight]</a>: We've had two major events in the last 60 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15798.919s">[Knight]</a>: Nothing more than what she's spending her apple money on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15801.68s">[Knight]</a>: We don't have any say whatsoever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15804.722s">[Knight]</a>: So I don't understand why we need to entertain these presentations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15808.304s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, all it is is a dog and pony show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15809.925s">[Knight]</a>: I really think it's nothing more than campaigning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15812.206s">[Knight]</a>: It's really campaigning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15813.067s">[Knight]</a>: It has nothing to do with what's going on in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15814.887s">[Knight]</a>: There's nothing to do with what's going on with his body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15816.488s">[Knight]</a>: It's campaigning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15817.929s">[Knight]</a>: So I don't think that that should be allowed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15819.25s">[Knight]</a>: I think that if the mayor is going to offer a paper that the paper should be related to issues that require council action by law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15846.215s">[Knight]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15846.515s">[Knight]</a>: So, so Madam President, what that really is, is that's a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15849.056s">[Knight]</a>: We don't want to do anything without doing anything because we want you guys to make sure that if we do it, you're not going to say anything bad if we make a mistake, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15855.739s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, ultimately they want verification and validation of the decisions that they make it, but we don't have to take a vote on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15861.102s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, come on, be a leader, make decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=416.638s">[Knight]</a>: Excuse me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=417.098s">[Knight]</a>: These are mandatory topics of bargaining, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=420.301s">[Knight]</a>: Yeah, so you guys should be taking care of this at the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=428.862s">[Knight]</a>: You guys need to enact your rights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=431.343s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, you know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=432.703s">[Knight]</a>: You have rights under the- I don't get it, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=438.164s">[Knight]</a>: Amy, time out here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=438.944s">[Knight]</a>: Time out here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=439.444s">[Knight]</a>: We're not the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=440.264s">[Knight]</a>: We don't negotiate contracts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=441.344s">[Knight]</a>: That's the job of the chief of staff per ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=443.605s">[Knight]</a>: All right, now, I haven't seen the chief of staff in a contract negotiation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=446.105s">[Knight]</a>: That's a whole different story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=446.985s">[Knight]</a>: We have KP Law doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=459.096s">[Knight]</a>: Yeah, I agree with you there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=461.059s">[Knight]</a>: But these are mandatory topics of bargaining.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=462.741s">[Knight]</a>: So when the administration is, you know, depleting the number of membership, the number of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=470.754s">[Knight]</a>: employees that are in the membership, you have to look at the work that's being performed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=473.696s">[Knight]</a>: And if the work that's being performed by an employee that's actually union workers, not in the union, they didn't bring the city up on charges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=479.52s">[Knight]</a>: You know, we've seen time and time again in this community, the level of respect that's given to organized labor by this administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=486.024s">[Knight]</a>: All right, and it's lacking, it's lacking and never before and I mean, I've worked in local government now for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=491.727s">[Knight]</a>: Shoot, since 1999, I represented union workers all across the Commonwealth from Worcester County to Springfield and back, all right, state, local.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=499.971s">[Knight]</a>: And I've never seen anything like this before, where employees are treated like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=503.693s">[Knight]</a>: And, you know, I just,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=507.367s">[Knight]</a>: I'm afraid for you for being up here right now, tonight and speaking out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=510.528s">[Knight]</a>: I'm afraid for you right now from being up here and speaking out tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=526.515s">[Knight]</a>: And the reason I say I'm scared for you right now is because I could go down a list of people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=530.78s">[Knight]</a>: have got they've gotten rid of come up here to this microphone and they've spoken out against some injustice, the councils agree with them, and those people are gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=537.443s">[Knight]</a>: So we look at Brian Karen's Mike for ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=540.004s">[Knight]</a>: Mike Durham, Alicia Nunley, Molly kibbe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=543.146s">[Knight]</a>: That's five people, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=544.386s">[Knight]</a>: That's five people, five people with families, five people who need health insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=549.429s">[Knight]</a>: Five people that committed to work for this community that came up here and spoke on behalf of the people and the taxpayers and the world let go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=555.441s">[Knight]</a>: I applaud you for your courage, Amy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=556.682s">[Knight]</a>: I do applaud you for the courage that you have for coming up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=558.924s">[Knight]</a>: I think a lot of this stuff really is mandatory topics of bargaining and mandatory topics of negotiation that need to be addressed at the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=564.368s">[Knight]</a>: I agree with you that the actions of this body and the vote that some people take, given these people raises, there's no question about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=569.812s">[Knight]</a>: The council needs to fund this, the mayor needs to propose it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=571.714s">[Knight]</a>: And the mayor did propose a significant pay hike for a number of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=575.617s">[Knight]</a>: What's the number councilor Bears?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=576.698s">[Knight]</a>: I believe it was 16 requests have been made so far for reclassification of positions and the council is- 18, we rejected 16.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=583.543s">[Knight]</a>: 18, we rejected 16.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=596.614s">[Knight]</a>: I hear you, and you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=598.796s">[Knight]</a>: When nobody listens to us at this meeting, tonight's the night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=602.359s">[Knight]</a>: It's our go-to, all right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=604.041s">[Knight]</a>: Because for a year, we've been sitting there, and we've been saying that we need certain tools in the toolbox to do a job for these people in this community, including you, including the workers in the city hall, and we haven't been given them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=613.049s">[Knight]</a>: We haven't been given the tools that we need to do the job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=615.11s">[Knight]</a>: And tonight is gonna be a day of reckoning because I don't think there's anybody behind this rail based upon the debates that I've listened to that's happy with the direction that this community is going in, that's happy with the way that we've been treated, that's happy with the way employees have been treated in this community, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=627.816s">[Knight]</a>: And I think that's safe to say, nobody behind this rail based upon the commentary and the minutes that have been approved by this body, that nobody behind this rail is happy with the direction this community is going in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=636.9s">[Knight]</a>: All right, so think about how frustrated you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=638.501s">[Knight]</a>: Now think about how frustrated we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=640.842s">[Knight]</a>: We're the last stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=642.024s">[Knight]</a>: You come to us for help and we can't get answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=644.788s">[Knight]</a>: The only time we can get answers is from January 1st to, you know, maybe, maybe, sorry, June 1st to June 31st, June 30th, you know, right at the, right at the close of the fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=653.801s">[Knight]</a>: That's when we get answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=656.172s">[Knight]</a>: Hi, Camilla.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=657.572s">[Knight]</a>: Good, good to see you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=769.226s">[Knight]</a>: Well, here's the problem, Camilla.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=770.447s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, ultimately, you want to time out point of information, you ask the question, let me answer it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=775.85s">[Knight]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=776.05s">[Knight]</a>: So you want to know where you can go and where you can turn, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=778.052s">[Knight]</a>: I'd say I'd say turn to the city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=780.373s">[Knight]</a>: But we don't have a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=781.554s">[Knight]</a>: We have no we have nobody in the law department that's here represent the interest of the taxpayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=934.246s">[Knight]</a>: Well, Amy, I think that's inaccurate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=937.41s">[Knight]</a>: The raises that have been, the raises that you're referring to have already been passed and they've already been funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=942.457s">[Knight]</a>: So regardless of whether or not this budget passed, these pay scales established by ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=947.731s">[Knight]</a>: everything except for I think Mary's position, the one that you referred to, because that hasn't been passed by ordinance and the human resources position that they keep ignoring us on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=955.795s">[Knight]</a>: But ultimately, these classifications for non-union titles and the cost of living adjustment that's attached there too, was passed by this body, not unanimously, but it was passed by this body and it was funded by this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=981.371s">[Knight]</a>: Right, but you have the power to negotiate in these non-union policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1007.591s">[Knight]</a>: So just a question so the negotiations between the clerical union and the administration I'm going well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1014.966s">[Knight]</a>: Really, no, I'm just thinking back to when the mayor put her budget presentation on opening night, and she said how great negotiations are going with all the negotiations and how close they were to settle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1286.282s">[Knight]</a>: Amy, the council did also in that proposal that was given to us, the mayor didn't tell us what classifications were included in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1291.865s">[Knight]</a>: And then when we did an investigation and we looked into it, we found that the executive was included in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1297.187s">[Knight]</a>: The mayor proposed a raise for herself in that proposal and we cut that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1301.109s">[Knight]</a>: And the mayor had also proposed a raise for the council and we cut that raise out as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1305.071s">[Knight]</a>: You know what I mean, to stand by what we've said that you know what I mean, rising tide floats all ships and we think that you guys should go so...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1324.408s">[Knight]</a>: Again, these are cost of living adjustments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1325.889s">[Knight]</a>: They're not performance-based.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1329.049s">[Knight]</a>: Right, but you're in a union, so you gotta negotiate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1331.43s">[Knight]</a>: They don't, you know, you have a collective bargaining.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1707.119s">[Knight]</a>: And I just want to just be on that point we did that last year Amy we did that at what one o'clock in the morning the mayor came up here in the magic money tree in her that grows in her office she shook it bunch of money fell out of it next thing you know we were going to get a lawyer that was going to come and help us out with zoning never happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1720.783s">[Knight]</a>: What else we're going to get out of that deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1723.104s">[Knight]</a>: City solicitor yeah assistant city solicitor the city council, never happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1726.885s">[Knight]</a>: Well, it's something else was supposed to come out of that too I think but you know what I mean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1729.946s">[Knight]</a>: And then the way that they were going to fund all of these promises that they made to the council was they were going to take the money out of the negotiated salaries account, which is the account that they use to fund your raises.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1737.873s">[Knight]</a>: And this council said, no, you're not taking the money out of that account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1740.775s">[Knight]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1741.115s">[Knight]</a>: So if you want to find magic money, you better find it somewhere else because you're not balancing this budget on the back of the working people in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1746.84s">[Knight]</a>: And the mayor went and took the money out of the public utility account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1749.382s">[Knight]</a>: So now we look at the transfers that are on the agenda this evening, we'll see hundreds of thousands of dollars in transfers so that we can pay to keep the lights on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2595.906s">[Knight]</a>: I'm just a little confused as to what leads us to mediation, because usually you go to mediation when you no longer can sit at the table anymore and make any forward progress, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2604.671s">[Knight]</a>: So mediation means you're at a stalemate at this point in time, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2608.032s">[Knight]</a>: You've reached what's called an impasse, is the negotiating term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2611.514s">[Knight]</a>: You've reached an impasse in negotiations, and we can no longer move further or backwards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2615.836s">[Knight]</a>: So my question is, if you're working with these unions and these employee groups, how have we gotten to a point where at impasse with multiple groups, if in fact we are working with them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2624.684s">[Knight]</a>: Because it doesn't make sense to me if we're going to mediation to a third party negotiator, a third party to handle our negotiations, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2630.928s">[Knight]</a>: Outside person, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2633.609s">[Knight]</a>: Through mediation because we reached impasse, that doesn't sound to me like the definition of working together with somebody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2638.292s">[Knight]</a>: So I'd just like to get a response from the chief of staff because she always likes to answer questions and provide points of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2643.755s">[Knight]</a>: So I'd like to ask the chief of staff, what got us to this point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2646.137s">[Knight]</a>: Why are we at a point of impasse when these contracts have been open now since this administration got elected?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2702.302s">[Knight]</a>: My question is this, is Feinberg, Dumont, and Brennan an employee organization?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2706.104s">[Knight]</a>: they're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2706.584s">[Knight]</a>: And Feinberg, Dumont, and Brennan is a law office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2708.966s">[Knight]</a>: They're a law office that also works with Local 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2710.767s">[Knight]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2711.867s">[Knight]</a>: So the way that this works is if you're going to decertify from a union, they're a member of the SEIU and they want to decertify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2716.97s">[Knight]</a>: You can't decertify when your contract is active.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2719.772s">[Knight]</a>: So what happens was the union said, we're going to decertify from SEIU.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2723.614s">[Knight]</a>: And they did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2724.174s">[Knight]</a>: And they picked up private representation because there's a cooling off period that's necessary before they can apply with another union.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2730.41s">[Knight]</a>: But nothing precluded them from going to the table and negotiating once they decertified from SEIU and once that contract was open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2755.315s">[Knight]</a>: Madam President, I just like to know what the timeline is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2759.636s">[Knight]</a>: I just like to know what the timeline is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2760.716s">[Knight]</a>: I'm just asking a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2874.104s">[Knight]</a>: point of information that men present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2875.906s">[Knight]</a>: I do believe the council asked for a legal opinion as to whether or not that paper was posed with an and sound ethical footing, because what happened was the mayor asked the council to actually approve its own raise and erase for herself in the same year that they perceive it, we never received a response to that so if Nina could follow up on that, that would be good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2898.048s">[Knight]</a>: question Madam President on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2899.609s">[Knight]</a>: Can you just tell me who represents the city in the collective bargaining sessions can the chief of staff tell you who represents the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2909.633s">[Knight]</a>: Yeah, yeah, whoever that's her name Yeah, that'd be fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2914.715s">[Knight]</a>: Who represents who represents the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2936.576s">[Knight]</a>: And just on that note, Madam President, the administration's well aware of city ordinance section 2-680.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2944.281s">[Knight]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2946.742s">[Knight]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2947.283s">[Knight]</a>: And part of that ordinance does read that the chief of staff shall be responsible for representing the mayor and I'll collect the bargaining sessions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2955.973s">[Knight]</a>: Is the Chief of Staff employed by KP Law?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2960.681s">[Knight]</a>: Is the Chief of Staff KP Law?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2996.849s">[Knight]</a>: Madam President, on that point, the Chief of Staff is wrong in her reading of the ordinance because that was not the legislative intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3005.031s">[Knight]</a>: And I can speak to that personally because I voted for it in 2016 when it came up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3010.133s">[Knight]</a>: I was a part of this body at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3014.215s">[Knight]</a>: So a reading of it is incorrect and is not in line with the legislative intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3017.877s">[Knight]</a>: And I think that any other member of this council that was on the body in 2016 can also concur with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3022.5s">[Knight]</a>: All right, so the way I'm looking at this now is we have an essential function and essential duty of the chief of staff that's been taken away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3030.125s">[Knight]</a>: The salary is still $135,000, but an essential function, essential duty has been taken away and it's been farmed out to a third party, private third party law firm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3039.602s">[Knight]</a>: That's an expense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3041.043s">[Knight]</a>: So when we sit down and we talk about why the council needs a city solicitor, it's to control these expenses and these wasteful spending habits that this administration has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3049.766s">[Knight]</a>: So when we look at the chief of staff's title in the ordinance that supports the job that you're supposed to do, and we'll go through it, the majority of the duties have been taken away, but yet the salary remains the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3063.612s">[Knight]</a>: So when I hear members of our clerical union get up here and quite frankly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3069.758s">[Knight]</a>: properly express dissatisfaction and disgust because they've been out of the contract for 48 months and then listen to the chief of staff come up here and try to explain our way out of the fact that it's because they're not able to sit down at the table and negotiate properly and then try to spin it by saying that they're precluded from doing it when I know for a fact they're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3089.488s">[Knight]</a>: It's just bizarre to me, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3091.009s">[Knight]</a>: And I feel like what it is is it's for the cameras and it's not for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3095.311s">[Knight]</a>: And it's to portray a picture and control a narrative that's not a reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3100.08s">[Knight]</a>: So that's where I am with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3101.421s">[Knight]</a>: I thank the chief of staff and president of the clerical union, Mr. Naglia, for being up here this evening and sharing with us their insight on such an important topic in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3113.247s">[Knight]</a>: And I am going to what I'd call use my reasonable deduction to determine who's being more truthful than not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3735.799s">[Knight]</a>: I just like to join Council Scott Kelly and offer my condolences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3739.001s">[Knight]</a>: Although I didn't know Fred, as well as George that I do remember him from a very young age, when I was involved in Methodist soccer, and I also had the opportunity to go to college with the sun Steve, and what a good kid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3753.309s">[Knight]</a>: Freddie Rita was just a nice guy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3754.529s">[Knight]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3755.229s">[Knight]</a>: George hit the nail right on the head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3756.89s">[Knight]</a>: He was someone that wasn't afraid to put himself, put the community before himself and put himself out there to do the work, roll up his sleeves, get dirty and not seek an ounce of credit for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3767.574s">[Knight]</a>: He was a great man.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3768.795s">[Knight]</a>: Like you said, great family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3770.195s">[Knight]</a>: And I joined my council colleague and extending my deep condolences to the family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4447.863s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4449.124s">[Knight]</a>: Was the mailing done, Madam President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4469.541s">[Knight]</a>: How far out did those notices go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4470.922s">[Knight]</a>: I know Mayor Longo, when she was a council, wanted to expand it to like 11 miles from where they were doing the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4491.921s">[Knight]</a>: It was 300 feet by law and then Mayor Lungo when she was a councilor wanted to expand that I think to 1000 or 600 or something like that and then it got passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4503.248s">[Knight]</a>: But then I don't think it's been a practice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4505.769s">[Knight]</a>: Administration change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4533.383s">[Knight]</a>: And then I just have one more question, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4536.186s">[Knight]</a>: The process that Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4540.349s">[Knight]</a>: Evans has outlined this evening, has that been reviewed by legal and been approved by legal as the proper way to enact such a measure that's before the body this evening?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4562.415s">[Knight]</a>: What I'm hearing is, you know, based upon a new zoning, the city council is not required to do this, this, this and this and now we have a special permit granting authority pursuant to this and so forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4571.297s">[Knight]</a>: This is the first time we've seen one of these papers before us where we're the site plan review granting authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4576.919s">[Knight]</a>: So my question was whether or not this procedural aspect was reviewed by legal counsel to ensure that we're in compliance with our own ordinance that we draft<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4600.463s">[Knight]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4601.044s">[Knight]</a>: So the council approved it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4602.205s">[Knight]</a>: Now, we have a process that's in place as this process been reviewed by legal to ensure that it complies with what we put together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4643.624s">[Knight]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4644.024s">[Knight]</a>: And what I'm doing is asking whether or not because the council hasn't seen one of these and so many things have come through in so many years that this process that's being established now for the first time in so many years is legally sound.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4662.293s">[Knight]</a>: Okay and we've conferred with him and he says this is the way we do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4670.156s">[Knight]</a>: So no we haven't conferred with legal as to whether or not this is the way that we do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4677.857s">[Knight]</a>: and said this is the process that we're going to do I have we not I don't know why every question we ask, it's a yes or no question gets 6,000 different answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5294.326s">[Knight]</a>: Point of information, Madam President, before he starts, I just want to go back to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5297.388s">[Knight]</a>: So Attorney Desmond, the proposal is that all your deliveries are going to take place between 12 o'clock and 9 1 o'clock in the morning in a in a location that abuts a residential neighborhood between 11 to 12 for Sunday through Thursday and not every evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5317.097s">[Knight]</a>: It's not working out so great, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5353.613s">[Knight]</a>: And when you went before the CD board this proposal of eliminating the loading dock and then telling them that you're going to apply for a special permit before us to have the loading take place after hours was presented to them in that fashion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5367.318s">[Knight]</a>: It was, and that was something that they supported.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5488.67s">[Knight]</a>: Does the applicant intend to apply for a license for an illuminated light or permit for an illuminated light sign?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5511.764s">[Knight]</a>: I'm assuming you'd want the light to light up if you guys want to be open to one o'clock in the morning on the weekends, you don't want people driving by it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5516.871s">[Knight]</a>: Yeah, but there's also houses across the street, people that live there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5596.729s">[Knight]</a>: Are there any new curb cuts that will be made from either Riverside Ave or the Fellsway to gain access to the property as part of the site plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5605.552s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5740.192s">[Knight]</a>: So, what you're telling me is that you're going to guarantee that these trucks that are delivering are going to follow this route every single time that they come here at 12 o'clock at night, three times a week or four times a week that they do it from now until the end of time as long as we have this permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5866.943s">[Knight]</a>: Because you did say they were going to be coming from Taunton, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5869.745s">[Knight]</a>: So it's guaranteed their first stop is Medford every time, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5873.108s">[Knight]</a>: Because they're coming from, I mean, those are the variables that I'm talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5876.19s">[Knight]</a>: It's like, there's no way we can guarantee that they're going to take the same route every time and go in there the same way every time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5923.606s">[Knight]</a>: And then you spoke about a couple of other Raising Canes that have very similar patterns, I guess, here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5928.551s">[Knight]</a>: So is it their model that they don't have loading docks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5932.414s">[Knight]</a>: Any of that sort?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5939.321s">[Knight]</a>: I don't care about out of state just yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6002.888s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, they're efficient plans for the business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6005.54s">[Knight]</a>: But there might not be efficient plans for the residents that live in the neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6008.422s">[Knight]</a>: And I think that's the number one concern right is the abundance right the people live across the street we have residents on Riverside we have residents across middle sector residents on the phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6016.646s">[Knight]</a>: And that's where I'm coming from on this but I appreciate it I'm not gonna keep saying we got residents live across the street I think you get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6345.923s">[Knight]</a>: Just one more question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6347.785s">[Knight]</a>: Estimated number of vehicle trips per day to the store?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6351.009s">[Knight]</a>: Per day?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6352.19s">[Knight]</a>: No, per week or whatever you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6353.331s">[Knight]</a>: I can do math.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6467.486s">[Knight]</a>: Based upon my math, that's like an average hour, we're looking at 1.8 to 1.9 vehicles in and out every hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6479.129s">[Knight]</a>: I'm sorry, every minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6480.809s">[Knight]</a>: Every minute, every minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6482.689s">[Knight]</a>: 1.9 every minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6486.75s">[Knight]</a>: Yeah, 114 divided by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9891.985s">[Knight]</a>: Does that fall in the parameters of 41 a 65 days right from when we receive it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9904.329s">[Knight]</a>: Yeah, we keep the public hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9920.493s">[Knight]</a>: I think Councilor Bares might have some, he wants to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9958.779s">[Knight]</a>: I didn't make a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9962.102s">[Knight]</a>: All I said was I don't want to wait the six day waiting period and I don't support voting on it until the six day waiting period is over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9993.084s">[Knight]</a>: Suppose Madam President, where it's a special permit, the special permit should go with the business and not with the address as well, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10065.39s">[Knight]</a>: We already have that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10066.631s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not in favor of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10067.971s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not putting any restrictions on it because I'm voting no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10208.362s">[Knight]</a>: Right, so we can't put restrictions on a special permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10211.164s">[Knight]</a>: Can you put restrictions on site plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10220.992s">[Knight]</a>: Did that come from Alicia or did that come from a lawyer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10223.614s">[Knight]</a>: That came from the Community Development Board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10230.053s">[Knight]</a>: That's why I asked the question initially, Madam President, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10233.116s">[Knight]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10233.617s">[Knight]</a>: At the end of the day, we need to make sure we're making decisions that are legally sound and strong footing and foundation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10239.382s">[Knight]</a>: We don't have that opportunity with this administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10241.625s">[Knight]</a>: We haven't had it for three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10255.998s">[Knight]</a>: At this rate, Madam President, this thing will pass with a constructive passage because we'll never take a vote on it the way that this administration is with us when it comes to giving us legal opinions and legal advice and access to legal counsel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10267.963s">[Knight]</a>: We can't put this on the table pending a legal opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10269.924s">[Knight]</a>: We'll never get one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10288.719s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, and we did it with BJ's too and then we got advice and then that advice ended up getting us taken to court again and then they called and said, what do you want us to do now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10295.885s">[Knight]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10296.345s">[Knight]</a>: It's like, it's just a, it's a comedy of errors in terms of the representation that we received legally here in the community, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10302.629s">[Knight]</a>: It puts us at a very significant disadvantage when it comes to making issues, making decisions on issues like this that will have a vast impact on the quality of life of the people that are about us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10313.197s">[Knight]</a>: All right, so I don't blame Raising Cane's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10314.598s">[Knight]</a>: I thank Raising Cane's for coming here and wanting to invest in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10317.98s">[Knight]</a>: All right, but the problem that I have is that the administration's not providing us with the tools to make informed and well-sounded decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10323.784s">[Knight]</a>: Okay, so at the end of the day, what happens?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10325.665s">[Knight]</a>: Who suffers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10326.546s">[Knight]</a>: The residents in this community, the taxpayers in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10329.108s">[Knight]</a>: Why do they suffer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10330.068s">[Knight]</a>: Because we're not able to make determinations that are going to impact things like growth, which is probably the most important thing in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10335.712s">[Knight]</a>: So we get a letter that comes out, we get a newspaper article from the Boston Globe that says, you know, Medford's the fastest growing community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10341.397s">[Knight]</a>: It can grow fast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10342.898s">[Knight]</a>: The question is whether or not it's desirable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10346.361s">[Knight]</a>: Is it a desirable place to live?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10348.583s">[Knight]</a>: I don't see Medford as being desirable right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10350.504s">[Knight]</a>: It might be growing fast, but I don't see it as desirable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10353.126s">[Knight]</a>: And part of the reason that I don't see it as desirable is because the elected officials in this community aren't treated with respect or given the tools that they need to do their job properly and ensure that the taxpayers' rights are protected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10364.215s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, Madam President, when it comes down to this paper that's before us this evening, it's something that I can't support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10370.238s">[Knight]</a>: You know, we talk about economic development and growth here in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10373.9s">[Knight]</a>: We had the opportunity to bring in a 300 plus million dollar development on Boston Ave, life science and biotech.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10381.184s">[Knight]</a>: It gets blown up by the administration, but we get chicken fingers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10384.125s">[Knight]</a>: We get chicken fingers, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10385.286s">[Knight]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10386.026s">[Knight]</a>: So that's the vision that we have in this community right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10387.967s">[Knight]</a>: That's the vision that we have when it comes to economic development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10390.889s">[Knight]</a>: Fast food restaurants, nail salons, Dunkin' Donuts, banks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10394.568s">[Knight]</a>: All right, we don't create jobs that bring a living wage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10398.153s">[Knight]</a>: We don't create jobs that provide health insurance for individuals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10401.177s">[Knight]</a>: When we're looking at this job model here, this position, this entity that's coming before us here, the job that it's gonna create aren't gonna pay people a living wage, not gonna pay them enough money to live in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10411.005s">[Knight]</a>: I have serious and significant concerns about a two-lane highway drive-through where people in flag waver outfits are going to be out there waving people through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10418.426s">[Knight]</a>: I have serious concerns about an illuminated sign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10421.907s">[Knight]</a>: I have serious concerns about noise traffic and product drop-off, especially with the extended hours in an area that's abutting a residential neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10430.308s">[Knight]</a>: You know, these are the reasons that I'm not going to support the bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10434.429s">[Knight]</a>: And I thank you for inviting me and providing me the opportunity to explain my vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10479.64s">[Knight]</a>: I'd just like the record to reflect Madam President that all these votes this evening are being taken without the advice of legal counsel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10725.063s">[Knight]</a>: Question, Madam President, why wouldn't the same restrictions relative to the permit going with the business and the reviews be attached to this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10733.03s">[Knight]</a>: They should be, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10953.253s">[Knight]</a>: I just question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11341.367s">[Knight]</a>: This was something that was brought to my attention by the many retirees in the city of Medford after an alert was sent out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11347.114s">[Knight]</a>: by PARAC and the Massachusetts State Retirement Board, saying that the city of Medford hasn't fully funded its cost of living adjustment capabilities for the upcoming fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11357.119s">[Knight]</a>: So as we see in this ordinance, I'm sorry, in this resolution, Madam President, the Massachusetts State Legislature, in its divine wisdom, did allow municipalities the local option to increase the cost of living adjustment for retirees to 5%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11370.485s">[Knight]</a>: It allows us to add an additional 2%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11373.867s">[Knight]</a>: Now, when we look at the cost of living adjustment that was given to retirees this year, it's actually higher than the 2% standard that the administration has put in place and in effect as the standard cost of living adjustment for active employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11384.012s">[Knight]</a>: However, we do have an opportunity, Madam President, for us to take a leap forward and take care of some of the retirees, the people that worked here in this community for a number of years,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11393.177s">[Knight]</a>: that made meant for the great place that it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11395.117s">[Knight]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11395.838s">[Knight]</a>: So when I look at this paper, what the request is, is to ask the administration to send us the request so that we can approve this document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11403.739s">[Knight]</a>: There's a two part process for which this needs to be approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11408.4s">[Knight]</a>: And the first is the retirement board and the second is the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11411.721s">[Knight]</a>: So I'm asking that the city administration, retirement board, which falls under the purview of the executive, takes the necessary steps to ensure that our retirees are taken care of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11422.827s">[Knight]</a>: We hear a lot of people come up to these microphones and talk how much they value the employees and what a great job they do and how much they care about the community and how wonderful all these people were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11430.975s">[Knight]</a>: Well, show it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11431.736s">[Knight]</a>: Put your money where your mouth is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11434.091s">[Knight]</a>: know, I'm sure there'll be another narrative or another reason why this can't happen, Madam President, you know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11438.693s">[Knight]</a>: And it's probably going to be rooted in not logic or reality, but what's going to control the spin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11443.976s">[Knight]</a>: But ultimately, at the end of the day, this is the right thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11446.697s">[Knight]</a>: All right, these people are on fixed incomes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11449.018s">[Knight]</a>: Okay, many of them live in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11451.759s">[Knight]</a>: They're all elderly, they've reached retirement age.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11453.92s">[Knight]</a>: And if they reach retirement age that means they've put in at least 10 years of employment and service to the general public and the taxpayers of this community and they deserve to be respected, and they deserve to be rewarded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11463.867s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, Madam President asked my council colleagues to support this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11714.073s">[Knight]</a>: When the elections manager was up here, they had put this on our agenda, and they had tried to make us vote to support the proposal that they put forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11723.143s">[Knight]</a>: But they said that the council doesn't need to support this proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11725.545s">[Knight]</a>: They were just putting us on there to make us aware of it, to put us in a position to support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11729.91s">[Knight]</a>: We didn't support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11731.171s">[Knight]</a>: We sent it back and we asked them to make those changes, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11733.533s">[Knight]</a>: So now we need an official paper from them saying that the Elections Commission has made this policy change, send it back to us and put it on the agenda just like they did previously, unless they're not going to be transparent this time around, because they had to change their mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11798.188s">[Knight]</a>: I'd appreciate a waiver of the remaining of the reader I think we need some bottom line there at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11816.445s">[Knight]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11819.949s">[Knight]</a>: This evening we got, I believe our third and fourth budgets from the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11825.195s">[Knight]</a>: We didn't get the I didn't see the press release that went out about how the administration's put out<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11829.059s">[Knight]</a>: three more budgets since the initial one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11831.301s">[Knight]</a>: But, you know, today at two o'clock, and again at six o'clock we got two additional budgets, right with updates or amendments or reallocations, and I'm wondering if the paper that before us this evening reflects those changes that have been made by the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11912.409s">[Knight]</a>: Did the mayor meet with any of the councils personally in our office to discuss this budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11917.274s">[Knight]</a>: Or on the telephone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11918.575s">[Knight]</a>: Or you for that matter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11922.679s">[Knight]</a>: Did you meet with any member of this elected body individually to discuss the budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11932.495s">[Knight]</a>: It's not a trick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11961.55s">[Knight]</a>: So these conversations were outside the scope of the public forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12029.508s">[Knight]</a>: It's on that point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12031.731s">[Knight]</a>: So I'm looking at this paper and it says that this was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12034.537s">[Knight]</a>: the mayor's fiscal year budget amended on 6 14 23.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12036.318s">[Knight]</a>: Today 6 2023.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12036.798s">[Knight]</a>: We've gotten two emails from you wanted six o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12041.519s">[Knight]</a>: I wanted two o'clock today that further amends the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12044.5s">[Knight]</a>: So what you're telling me now is that the paper that's before us that was amended on 6 15 reflects those amendments that you sent us on 6 20.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12139.565s">[Knight]</a>: I did I was just gonna say on that point in these other communities normally when financial data is requested from the legislative body they receive it they're not told that they can't get it even though the ordinance says it should be providing it that the book should be provided to the Council upon request, you know, so you know when we talk about what they do other places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12156.797s">[Knight]</a>: Let's talk about the good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12158.478s">[Knight]</a>: But let's talk about the bad that we do here too because what other places do we don't do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12543.797s">[Knight]</a>: So why do we have a meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12633.989s">[Knight]</a>: Just a quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12634.809s">[Knight]</a>: When did the mayor determine that it was time to have a discussion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12644.095s">[Knight]</a>: Absent a vote of the council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12650.179s">[Knight]</a>: Not as the leadership team, as council of business noted earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12660.015s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not trying to trip you up I'm just saying as the elected president I had the same issue with john Falco, and I got my ass kicked for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12665.897s">[Knight]</a>: But I called him out on it, and I got a beating on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12667.918s">[Knight]</a>: You know what I mean, because I like the president to represent the interest of the body not the interest of yourself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12673.379s">[Knight]</a>: So when you get elected president of the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12676.0s">[Knight]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12678.101s">[Knight]</a>: different responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12679.502s">[Knight]</a>: You have responsibility to the people buying this realtor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12682.064s">[Knight]</a>: Now you did what you did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12683.204s">[Knight]</a>: It is what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12684.105s">[Knight]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12684.605s">[Knight]</a>: And I know that you haven't been in the chair a long time, so I get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12688.547s">[Knight]</a>: I get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12689.128s">[Knight]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12689.728s">[Knight]</a>: But ultimately, right, we're a body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12692.31s">[Knight]</a>: We're a body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12694.351s">[Knight]</a>: We're a body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12695.111s">[Knight]</a>: Now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12703.631s">[Knight]</a>: We're a body, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12704.732s">[Knight]</a>: So right now what I'm seeing happened is we have a budget that's before us that wasn't the budget that we got when the press releases went out saying this is the first time you ever got a budget, because it was a fake budget, because the school department never passed their aspect of it before it comes to us, which is the normal practice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12719.584s">[Knight]</a>: All right, now we have an administration horse trading, horse trading outside the public sphere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12727.315s">[Knight]</a>: to ensure passage of a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12729.616s">[Knight]</a>: The same administration that runs on transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12733.598s">[Knight]</a>: That's not transparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12735.579s">[Knight]</a>: I don't care what anybody says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12737.239s">[Knight]</a>: It's a classic divide and conquer strategy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12740.281s">[Knight]</a>: A classic divide and conquer strategy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12743.262s">[Knight]</a>: So the mayor for three years can fail to respond to the body public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12747.724s">[Knight]</a>: Fail to respond to the body public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12750.105s">[Knight]</a>: Then there's closed door deals with select counselors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12754.397s">[Knight]</a>: And other counselors that are elected by the people of this community are excluded?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12763.282s">[Knight]</a>: You guys think you know about the open meeting law?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12765.283s">[Knight]</a>: I'm gonna tell you right now, I think you're teetering very close, very close to a violation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12770.326s">[Knight]</a>: Just because you weren't in the same room at the same time doesn't mean there wasn't deliberation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12777.37s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not making that accusation, but what I'm saying is, perception is reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12783.066s">[Knight]</a>: So the perception that I get right now is that the mayor picked up the phone, called a few people into her office, and cut a deal, left the rest of us hanging on the shelf.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12790.089s">[Knight]</a>: So we sat here, and we made votes, and we made speeches, and we made pledges, and we made commitments to the people in this community, to the people in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12800.822s">[Knight]</a>: And sometimes making hard decisions isn't politically expedient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12804.905s">[Knight]</a>: Sometimes making hard decisions isn't politically popular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12808.227s">[Knight]</a>: But people didn't elect us to take the easy road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12811.829s">[Knight]</a>: People didn't elect us to take the easy way out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12815.031s">[Knight]</a>: So we've sat here and we beat our chests about, oh, we're gonna protect everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12819.514s">[Knight]</a>: We're gonna get this, we're gonna get that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12821.074s">[Knight]</a>: We've gotten nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12822.415s">[Knight]</a>: This administration's accomplished nothing other than recycling and regurgitating old plans from previous administrations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12829.394s">[Knight]</a>: And we're sitting here passing it like a rubber stamp, pot and parcel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12834.959s">[Knight]</a>: Because it's not about Medfit, it's not about the community, it's about what we can get on the way through the door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12845.368s">[Knight]</a>: It's a disgrace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12847.049s">[Knight]</a>: It's a disgrace and I'm disgusted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12849.171s">[Knight]</a>: For the first time in my life, I'm embarrassed to be from this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12853.254s">[Knight]</a>: I love this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12854.295s">[Knight]</a>: I've loved this city my whole life, and I am embarrassed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12857.738s">[Knight]</a>: When I go to neighboring towns and other communities, and I get people going, what the hell's going on with your city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12861.581s">[Knight]</a>: What's going on with your mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12862.822s">[Knight]</a>: What's going on over there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12864.884s">[Knight]</a>: And we all say the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12865.885s">[Knight]</a>: I know it's a disaster.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12867.446s">[Knight]</a>: It's a disaster.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12867.987s">[Knight]</a>: I hear every single person behind this rail say it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12870.189s">[Knight]</a>: I know it's a nightmare.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12871.41s">[Knight]</a>: I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12871.89s">[Knight]</a>: I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12872.29s">[Knight]</a>: Oh, it's awful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12872.791s">[Knight]</a>: It's only going to get worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12873.972s">[Knight]</a>: Just wait till next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12875.273s">[Knight]</a>: And here we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12876.684s">[Knight]</a>: Give me the rubber stamp.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12878.407s">[Knight]</a>: Let's stamp it now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12879.588s">[Knight]</a>: I got what I needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12880.83s">[Knight]</a>: Someone might've got a job out of the budget in the closed door deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12883.434s">[Knight]</a>: I don't know who got what.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12884.576s">[Knight]</a>: All I know is I got nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12886.661s">[Knight]</a>: All I know is I got nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12888.102s">[Knight]</a>: Not even the courtesy of a telephone call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12890.284s">[Knight]</a>: I got a text message at 418.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12891.746s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not sure what time you guys met with the mayor, but I got a text message at 418 saying if I have any last minute questions on the budget, let me or Nina know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12899.672s">[Knight]</a>: A text.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12900.974s">[Knight]</a>: A text.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12901.954s">[Knight]</a>: A text message at four o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12903.636s">[Knight]</a>: Two hours before a meeting, we were talking about $180 million plus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12908.54s">[Knight]</a>: Enough's enough with this clown show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12910.922s">[Knight]</a>: Madam President, I rest my case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12912.482s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not supporting the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12913.943s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not supporting the budget because I don't feel it's transparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12916.323s">[Knight]</a>: I don't feel as though it's an accurate depiction of the finances in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12919.544s">[Knight]</a>: And I don't feel as though it positions us for a future of growth and for a future of success.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12924.145s">[Knight]</a>: All right, our school department is going to fall apart next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12928.086s">[Knight]</a>: We're going to have to lay off 33 teachers because all of our SM money is gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12930.946s">[Knight]</a>: Nobody cares about that, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12933.067s">[Knight]</a>: You know why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12933.667s">[Knight]</a>: It's going to look good in the press releases this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12935.447s">[Knight]</a>: It's going to look good in the campaign material this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12938.728s">[Knight]</a>: Time in and time out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12941.138s">[Knight]</a>: Time in and time out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12942.278s">[Knight]</a>: What's the number one rule of an elected official?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12944.219s">[Knight]</a>: Once you become an elected official, get reelected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12947.36s">[Knight]</a>: We all know that, right, Madam President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14742.701s">[Knight]</a>: And I want to finish my question, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14744.762s">[Knight]</a>: Ultimately, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14745.863s">[Knight]</a>: We've been asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14747.103s">[Knight]</a>: We've been asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14748.464s">[Knight]</a>: We've been asking for financial documentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14750.745s">[Knight]</a>: for two years and haven't gotten it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14752.086s">[Knight]</a>: And now here we are at the budget and you say no, that's a mistake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14755.027s">[Knight]</a>: Oh, that's a mistake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14755.887s">[Knight]</a>: Maybe if they shared this information with us that we've been asking for, as the conduit of communication per the city ordinance that the chief of staff was as a badge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14765.331s">[Knight]</a>: Maybe if some of this do you have a question for me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14768.093s">[Knight]</a>: Yeah, I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14768.993s">[Knight]</a>: I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14769.613s">[Knight]</a>: How is it that we're planning a budget based upon figures that are mistakes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14776.175s">[Knight]</a>: It's all this is, you know, so, so, so, so, so, so when it comes to clear that sucks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14785.382s">[Knight]</a>: And when it comes time for us to do our research, we know clear that's not good so we asked for the information and we don't get the information, but then we're expected to make an informed decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14792.887s">[Knight]</a>: And then when it comes down to us actually sitting down and having a transparent discussion, the mayor doesn't divide and conquer strategy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14799.432s">[Knight]</a>: You know, so that's where we're at in this whole thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14801.555s">[Knight]</a>: This is a joke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14926.391s">[Knight]</a>: Let's just look at the law department as an example, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14929.851s">[Knight]</a>: Now, we haven't had a city solicitor or an assistant city solicitor for a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14934.312s">[Knight]</a>: Last year, we budgeted what, about $422,000?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14938.902s">[Knight]</a>: We still don't have a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14940.142s">[Knight]</a>: We still don't have an assistant city solicitor, yet the department's budget goes up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14944.503s">[Knight]</a>: How does that happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14945.284s">[Knight]</a>: There's nobody even in the office, but the department's budget is going up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14948.604s">[Knight]</a>: There's no employees there except for Janice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14951.605s">[Knight]</a>: There's one person in the office, but the budget goes up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14954.026s">[Knight]</a>: How is that possible if the positions are vacant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14956.886s">[Knight]</a>: I don't wanna hear we pass the COLA, because the person that comes in should be starting at step one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14960.987s">[Knight]</a>: So I don't wanna hear we pass the COLA, because that's just another way to control a false narrative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14968.769s">[Knight]</a>: Okay, why are we giving the city solicitor a raise when the position is vacant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14971.834s">[Knight]</a>: Why is the budget in this the law office going up when the two positions that have funded through the vacant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14980.146s">[Knight]</a>: Yeah, please don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15111.205s">[Knight]</a>: Okay, and didn't we not have vacancies in the finance director's position during that period of time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15123.955s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15422.428s">[Knight]</a>: Madam President, can you repeat that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15424.769s">[Knight]</a>: Instead of taking votes as a body, we want us to email... No, you said you want us to email them individually instead of taking votes as a body and raising the issue with the body public?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15437.096s">[Knight]</a>: And not discuss them, yeah?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16201.268s">[Knight]</a>: It was never shame on you shame on me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16204.971s">[Knight]</a>: Madam President ultimately right we talked about this is this is a communication issue right more than anything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16210.234s">[Knight]</a>: It's a communication issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16211.135s">[Knight]</a>: Would everybody agree this is a communication issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16213.016s">[Knight]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16213.576s">[Knight]</a>: Everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16213.917s">[Knight]</a>: So who's responsible for communication from the mayor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16217.853s">[Knight]</a>: Anybody, anybody know who's responsible for the communications from the mayor's office?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16220.975s">[Knight]</a>: Who went from the mayor's office?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16222.136s">[Knight]</a>: Anybody?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16223.236s">[Knight]</a>: No, it's not the communications director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16225.378s">[Knight]</a>: It's not the COVID specialist, communication specialist or the other two people they got in that office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16230.361s">[Knight]</a>: According to the city ordinances, there shall be a chief of staff of policy appointed by the mayor whose duty shall include managing communication and information both to and from the office of the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16242.929s">[Knight]</a>: So we talk about some of the problems that we have in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16247.91s">[Knight]</a>: A lot of it lies in the application of the ordinances and the incumbents interpretation thereof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16261.38s">[Knight]</a>: So when I sit here and I look at a lot of the problems that happen in this community, and I think about the things we get we get all upset about KP law, one of the biggest things we get upset about right, let's read the city ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16271.888s">[Knight]</a>: Let's read what the city ordinance says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16274.15s">[Knight]</a>: Okay, about an assistant city solicitor, because the city ordinance says that the mayor may appoint an assistant city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16282.856s">[Knight]</a>: Now, can anybody tell me in last year's budget what the assistant city solicitor was?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16286.559s">[Knight]</a>: I believe it was $422,000 was the legal department's budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16289.761s">[Knight]</a>: And our city ordinance says that the administration can't spend more than has been appropriated for the department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16297.086s">[Knight]</a>: But we have correspondence from this administration saying they spent $450,000 on KP law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16302.452s">[Knight]</a>: which exceeds the 422,000 in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16307.216s">[Knight]</a>: Whether or not that information is presented to us now as accurate is in question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16312.501s">[Knight]</a>: But ultimately there's a significant misapplication of the city ordinances in terms of the way that the city is supposed to run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16320.768s">[Knight]</a>: The first of which being there shall be a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16323.891s">[Knight]</a>: Well, there isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16324.812s">[Knight]</a>: There shall be one, there has to be one, there isn't one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16330.145s">[Knight]</a>: Then there are controls put in place through city ordinance to prevent wild and uncontrolled spending like what's going on with KP law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16337.768s">[Knight]</a>: And we don't abide by that either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16342.63s">[Knight]</a>: But to ensure that we are complying with it, we don't have the financial data before us to allow us to make that determination as to whether or not we're in compliance with our local ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16355.795s">[Knight]</a>: Last time we raised an issue about an ordinance, the mayor said, well, the city council can just change it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16360.563s">[Knight]</a>: Last time we raised an issue about process, the chief of staff said, we'll just do it under suspension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16366.106s">[Knight]</a>: This is the same administration that ran on transparency, the same administration that ran on community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16375.33s">[Knight]</a>: Okay, so when we sit here yelling and screaming at each other, let's understand, we're not the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16385.074s">[Knight]</a>: Us in this circle behind this rail are not the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16389.121s">[Knight]</a>: You know what we are?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16390.161s">[Knight]</a>: We're frustrated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16391.342s">[Knight]</a>: You know why we're frustrated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16392.442s">[Knight]</a>: Because we've been putting a plastic bag and we've been trying to punch our way out for the last two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16399.025s">[Knight]</a>: That's why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16400.466s">[Knight]</a>: So we got Zach and George getting frustrated at each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16403.487s">[Knight]</a>: Why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16403.767s">[Knight]</a>: Because of the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16407.629s">[Knight]</a>: Nicole and I becoming very good friends through this whole entire process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16411.371s">[Knight]</a>: Why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16411.591s">[Knight]</a>: Because of the shared concerns and values that we have with the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16417.056s">[Knight]</a>: Doesn't look that way, but that's really what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16420.3s">[Knight]</a>: That's the fact and the reality behind the situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16423.383s">[Knight]</a>: Now, some of us speak a little bit more passionately than others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16426.406s">[Knight]</a>: Some of us have been around a little bit longer than others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16428.849s">[Knight]</a>: So some of us have a level of frustration that's a lot higher than other people's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16433.714s">[Knight]</a>: Some of us have also had the experience of putting up with what I call a BS meter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16438.499s">[Knight]</a>: We all have a BS meter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16439.66s">[Knight]</a>: We can all smell it from a mile away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16441.242s">[Knight]</a>: Some of us are better at smelling it than others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16443.284s">[Knight]</a>: Some of us allow people to have a little bit more leeway when it comes to wafting their BS around here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16447.888s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not one of those people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16449.29s">[Knight]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16449.69s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not going to sit here and waste my time listening to BS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16452.673s">[Knight]</a>: That's not what I'm here for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16454.034s">[Knight]</a>: I'm here to make good decisions on behalf of the taxpayers in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16457.758s">[Knight]</a>: And I can't do that because this administration is fearless.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16461.889s">[Knight]</a>: So we sit here and we infight and we argue and everything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16464.83s">[Knight]</a>: We all want the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16467.071s">[Knight]</a>: We want the respect that we deserve from this administration so that we can do the job that the people in this community elected us to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16474.014s">[Knight]</a>: And we can't do it based upon the tools, the resources, the processes, and the procedures that this administration has implemented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16481.437s">[Knight]</a>: And week in and week out, we express these frustrations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16483.918s">[Knight]</a>: And week in and week in, we beat our chest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16486.616s">[Knight]</a>: And week in and week out, nothing changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16488.537s">[Knight]</a>: Everything stays the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16490.518s">[Knight]</a>: Everything stays the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16491.479s">[Knight]</a>: And how do you make things stay the same?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16493.22s">[Knight]</a>: By doing things like divide and conquer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16495.421s">[Knight]</a>: By doing things like cutting back on deals and making promises you're not gonna keep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16501.705s">[Knight]</a>: By sending out press releases that control narratives that aren't true, but control the spin because there's no local media in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16509.548s">[Knight]</a>: Those are the realities of the situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16511.989s">[Knight]</a>: That's what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16512.83s">[Knight]</a>: And these are the hurdles that we face as a body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16515.812s">[Knight]</a>: But for people who are watching this or people that are sitting in the audience saying, Jesus, these people are nuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16520.114s">[Knight]</a>: What the hell is going on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16521.575s">[Knight]</a>: We all want the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16523.096s">[Knight]</a>: We're just mad because they're not giving it to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16526.598s">[Knight]</a>: That's what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16528.499s">[Knight]</a>: Everybody on this side of the rail shares the same value.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16533.261s">[Knight]</a>: They wanna make Medfit a better place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16536.223s">[Knight]</a>: Everyone on this side of the rail has been asking for the tools to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16540.776s">[Knight]</a>: There's only one common denominator and one common thread.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16547.842s">[Knight]</a>: One hurdle, one reason that we haven't been provided with the tools that we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16554.127s">[Knight]</a>: And it comes from across the hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16556.289s">[Knight]</a>: And let's not forget that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16557.87s">[Knight]</a>: Because at the end of this meeting, we're all gonna leave, we're all gonna be pissed off at each other and everything else for no reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16563.475s">[Knight]</a>: Because this is what the administration wants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16566.157s">[Knight]</a>: This is the method that they created to divide a wedge between us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16571.189s">[Knight]</a>: to make it so that this body can't be effective and that they can continue to move with reckless and abandoned and lack of transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16579.096s">[Knight]</a>: And it hurts the taxpayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16580.257s">[Knight]</a>: It hurts the residents in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16583.961s">[Knight]</a>: It hurts the process and it makes people distrustful of government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16588.965s">[Knight]</a>: When people distrust government, they don't participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16591.848s">[Knight]</a>: And when people don't participate, then government operates in a vacuum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16597.176s">[Knight]</a>: We have an administration that already said they throw a third of the voters off of active roles every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16603.459s">[Knight]</a>: When you're taking off the active roles, you know what you don't get in the mail?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16607.98s">[Knight]</a>: Literature from candidates that are running from office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16611.122s">[Knight]</a>: Wow, imagine that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16612.382s">[Knight]</a>: Now you're misinformed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16614.023s">[Knight]</a>: You're an inactive voter that's misinformed, but you're expected to come out to the polls and vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16619.205s">[Knight]</a>: Let's think about what's going on here, folks, because we're not the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16622.526s">[Knight]</a>: And we sound like we are, and we're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16625.868s">[Knight]</a>: We aren't the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16628.579s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17114.321s">[Knight]</a>: So move on a president provided that I could get a question answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17117.003s">[Knight]</a>: Historically, historically, the administration has presented us with this $500,000 request after the rates have been established after the budget's been passed and it's been used for rate relief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17128.792s">[Knight]</a>: Is that going to be the current philosophy behind the expenditure of this plane that's in this paper this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17157.747s">[Knight]</a>: Yeah, I mean every year we get a bill of paper for $500,000 that asks us to offset the rates to the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17164.252s">[Knight]</a>: to the ratepayers for water and sewer through the retained earnings account is this going to be is that's this is this that same 500,000 or is this a different 500,000 or is this something that we're not going to see this year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17180.924s">[Knight]</a>: So they haven't set the rates yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17184.386s">[Knight]</a>: I get $500,000 in rate relief if they do when they do, but we don't know what the rates are going to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17189.19s">[Knight]</a>: I think the motion itself would make sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17255.138s">[Knight]</a>: Section 22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17259.519s">[Knight]</a>: First time in financial reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17261.46s">[Knight]</a>: Paper can be passed in one evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17326.083s">[Knight]</a>: We're transferring X amount of dollars from surplus to deficit to balance the budget, I'm sure, is what he's going to say, something along those lines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17346.305s">[Knight]</a>: So certain accounts run a deficit and certain accounts have a surplus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17349.367s">[Knight]</a>: And what we're doing is the bottom line remains the same and all we're doing is evening out the accounts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17353.29s">[Knight]</a>: So that makes accounting easy, but at the end of the day, the bottom line hasn't changed, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17504.633s">[Knight]</a>: Madam President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17506.254s">[Knight]</a>: First off, this is a good paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17507.795s">[Knight]</a>: It's a paper that I actually filed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17509.516s">[Knight]</a>: This is a paper that I introduced a number of years ago under the Burke administration, and I'm glad to see that the administration has moved on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17516.7s">[Knight]</a>: I'd like to have a committee of the whole paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17519.081s">[Knight]</a>: I've seen this community do just fine in previous years without a stabilization fund and to think that if we don't establish this this immediate second and appropriate $5 million into it that the city is going to fail, I think is a little bit more of a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17534.93s">[Knight]</a>: a fear-mongering approach than it is actually the reality of the situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17538.652s">[Knight]</a>: So in looking at this, you know, the city's been able to survive for all these years without a stabilization fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17543.975s">[Knight]</a>: I think we should sit down and we should talk about it a little bit more and define parameters around the stabilization fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17548.557s">[Knight]</a>: I know state law dictates a lot of what we can and can't do, but I think it would be nice to codify that and to establish a process and a procedure very much like the better budget plan that's been put out to amend that charter, Madam President, the procedure and a process that makes it transparent and make sure that everybody knows what to understand and how to understand it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17706.407s">[Knight]</a>: Sounds like it's a pretty big deal, Madam President, and it's 5 million bucks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17711.129s">[Knight]</a>: We're not gonna have a meeting on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17713.783s">[Knight]</a>: been recommended by auditors, been recommended by bond council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17716.985s">[Knight]</a>: It's necessary for us to keep our A plus rating and it's a $5 million appropriation and we're not gonna have a meeting on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17752.426s">[Knight]</a>: You're making it sound like they're going to be able to get bond council there at the auditor there and everybody else there in 10 days notice and I don't see that happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17786.655s">[Knight]</a>: Bond Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17792.357s">[Knight]</a>: And ultimately, is there anything that precludes this community from bringing this paper forward between now and March?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17801.897s">[Knight]</a>: while our free cash is being certified, knowing that we have more than $5 million in our free cash already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17808.642s">[Knight]</a>: What precludes us from creating this in 90 days or 60 days, but before March?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17814.086s">[Knight]</a>: I'm just asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17870.111s">[Knight]</a>: It just needs to be recertified, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17888.763s">[Knight]</a>: We just passed like a $200 million budget, didn't we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17904.939s">[Knight]</a>: Yes, which- We can establish a stabilization fund and not fund it, and then wait for the free cash to be certified, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17912.982s">[Knight]</a>: We could go through a legislative process and create actual legislation instead of doing this at the 11th hour and making a $5 million appropriation on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17920.947s">[Knight]</a>: You know, I think we're putting the horse behind the car.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17923.748s">[Knight]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17924.369s">[Knight]</a>: It's like, if we're going to create a process, let's create the process and let's go through the legislative process and create it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17929.492s">[Knight]</a>: Let's not throw $5 million into an account and then say figure the rest of that out later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17939.094s">[Knight]</a>: It's like we're creating it and funding it in the same day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17941.338s">[Knight]</a>: Why don't we create it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17963.04s">[Knight]</a>: Does it take a super majority to create it or a super majority to withdraw from it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17966.201s">[Knight]</a>: Both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17996.159s">[Knight]</a>: I'm not sure what to say beyond that we've been on the floor for that amount of committee papers still in the paper now the paper is disposed of by being voted into committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=646.029s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you very much, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=647.389s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Knox, for bringing this resolution forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=650.154s">[Knight]</a>: I think this is a great proactive approach to improving the quality of life for residents here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=655.677s">[Knight]</a>: I will be voting in favor of this resolution and I might ask that the resolution be amended by way of a B paper, Mr. President, which would ask that the Medford police or the building department report back to this council locations that have been reported to have been graffitied within the last 12 months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=670.025s">[Knight]</a>: I think it's very important that we keep track of this data to determine whether or not there were clusters and trends that are occurring here in the city so that we know where to ramp up enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=677.233s">[Knight]</a>: So I'd like to thank Councilor Marks for taking such a proactive approach to looking at the quality of life in this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=682.416s">[Knight]</a>: And I will be voting in favor of this resolution, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=684.878s">[Knight]</a>: I just ask that it be amended for the Police Department of the powers that be to report back any locations that have been reported within the last calendar year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4365.073s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you very much, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4366.86s">[Knight]</a>: I think it's very important that we recognize the efforts and the leadership that Councilman Marks has put forward on the issue of a dog park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4373.064s">[Knight]</a>: Not only has he brought this issue to the council floor, he's actually put his money where his mouth is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4376.886s">[Knight]</a>: He's gone out, I witnessed him personally collecting signatures from members in this community to seek support for a dog park, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4384.75s">[Knight]</a>: And that's the proactive grassroots type of work that makes the community really come together and it makes matters like this come to fruition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4393.625s">[Knight]</a>: I'd like to congratulate Councilor Marks on the efforts that he's put forward, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4396.886s">[Knight]</a>: Not only does he file the resolutions, but he does the legwork.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5602.964s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you very much, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5608.789s">[Knight]</a>: taken a big interest in recent weeks to the water and sewer billing system and the rates that are in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5613.89s">[Knight]</a>: And in my research, I've been able to determine that in 2006, of the MWRA communities, Medford was the 15th highest consumer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5624.413s">[Knight]</a>: And it's also my understanding that a tiered rate system is put in place to promote conservation of use of water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5631.815s">[Knight]</a>: Previous councils, dating back as far as I've looked to 2007, have consistently voted to establish a tiered rate system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5638.312s">[Knight]</a>: We have paper 07464 to establish a tiered rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5642.034s">[Knight]</a>: Paper 07559 to establish a progressive H2O consumption system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5648.296s">[Knight]</a>: Paper 08591, the city engineer present the tiered system for the council to review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5653.418s">[Knight]</a>: 09535, a report on the tiered rate system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5655.779s">[Knight]</a>: 09706, creation of a tiered system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5657.18s">[Knight]</a>: 09838, an excessive use of water program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5658.82s">[Knight]</a>: 10036, the status of a tiered rate system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5669.347s">[Knight]</a>: 720, report back on the progress of creating a tiered system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5673.769s">[Knight]</a>: Dating back to 12-4-07, the Medford City Council has been on record in supporting looking at water and sewer rates and eyeing a multi-tiered system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5682.772s">[Knight]</a>: As recently as 12-24, Mr. President, there was an article in the Medford transcript saying that the City Council supported the implementation of a tiered system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5689.495s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Mayorka was a champion for such a program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5692.016s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Mayorka was of the theory that if you use more, you pay more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5695.397s">[Knight]</a>: And I certainly agree with that philosophy, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5699.13s">[Knight]</a>: In looking at how the rates are determined, we have a Water and Sewer Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5703.072s">[Knight]</a>: The Water and Sewer Commission meets monthly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5704.994s">[Knight]</a>: Here in my city council packet this week, I received a notice of when this Water and Sewer Commission is going to meet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5710.597s">[Knight]</a>: For the edification of the people at home, I'd like to let them know that on October 15, 2014, in room 201, at 2 o'clock, the Water and Sewer Commission will be meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5718.982s">[Knight]</a>: It's open to the public and all members can attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5721.204s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I certainly share some concerns about the itemization of the bill, and I too have seen irregularities in water bills, my own included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5727.504s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5728.084s">[Knight]</a>: However, I think to say that this is a surprise is a little bit of a misconstrue of what's happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5735.528s">[Knight]</a>: It's not in line with what the history shows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5737.448s">[Knight]</a>: It's not in line with what the history says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5819.174s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you very much, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5820.535s">[Knight]</a>: And I was getting there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5821.776s">[Knight]</a>: I think that, you know, when we get a response from the mayor saying to call a public hearings within the council purview, it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5827.522s">[Knight]</a>: We have subcommittees, we have committees, committees of the whole, which has the power to call a committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5833.168s">[Knight]</a>: We have a committee on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5834.744s">[Knight]</a>: auditing finance, budget, and taxation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5836.444s">[Knight]</a>: We have a subcommittee on intergovernmental affairs, and I think that when we call for a public hearing, we don't need to have the permission of the mayor to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5842.546s">[Knight]</a>: We can use our internal governmental structure that we have here as a council in order to promote these meetings, in order to make these meetings happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5848.968s">[Knight]</a>: So when I looked at it and I saw that it falls within the council purview, and then I read the language in the resolution, I said, well, I think that this refers to the fact that the council does have the power to call this meeting, and we don't need the mayor to give us authority to do such.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5859.67s">[Knight]</a>: And that's where I'm coming from, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5861.131s">[Knight]</a>: I certainly feel as though we need to have a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5863.427s">[Knight]</a>: better line of communication in terms of the way that our water and sewer billing is implemented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5868.888s">[Knight]</a>: And I certainly have concerns, because when we look at 2007, we look at the ideas that came out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5873.569s">[Knight]</a>: And the tiered system was really 0 to 1,000 cubic feet of use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5877.87s">[Knight]</a>: And it's gone down to 800.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5879.391s">[Knight]</a>: So I can understand that there must have been some deliberation and some decision-making process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5883.012s">[Knight]</a>: And I, too, share the concerns as to how do we get to this figure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5885.932s">[Knight]</a>: It's my understanding that, based upon conversations that I've had with members of the Water Sewer Commission, that about two-thirds of the households in the city will fall in the first tier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5894.149s">[Knight]</a>: I haven't seen any hard facts and hard figures on that, but that's what's been represented to me through the conversations that I've had with the Water and Sewer Commission, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5900.893s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, I certainly do not see any reason for us to go to the mayor's office and ask the mayor for permission to hold a hearing on this when we have a perfect structure that's in place that's underutilized right now in order to do such.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5911.159s">[Knight]</a>: So I would move, Mr. President, this be forwarded to one of the appropriate subcommittees that we have here that's in existence already for us to actually take ownership of the issue and get the answers that we need without relying on somebody else giving them to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5921.084s">[Knight]</a>: We can go and extract them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6413.158s">[Knight]</a>: Counselor Mack.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6413.598s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you very much, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6415.079s">[Knight]</a>: I echo the sentiments relative to infrastructure that Counselor Max has raised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6420.515s">[Knight]</a>: Our MWRA assessment is calculated every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6422.897s">[Knight]</a>: It's done so by the MWRA estimating the total amount of revenue that's going to be necessary for them to run their water system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6429.603s">[Knight]</a>: The chart is then calculated at a flat rate times the metered water used in a community, and that's how they come up with their assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6435.368s">[Knight]</a>: However, it's interesting to point out that debt service represents 60% of the FY15 budget at the MWRA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6439.992s">[Knight]</a>: So that means 60%<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6443.826s">[Knight]</a>: of their budget is dedicated just to debt service for infrastructure improvements that they've made to deliver these water to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6449.128s">[Knight]</a>: So I think it's time that we need to take a look internally and say, OK, now it's time for us to make this commitment to our infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6454.589s">[Knight]</a>: Because ultimately, in the long run, it is going to reduce the cost for the individuals in this community to pay water bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6841.74s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I do appreciate where Councillor Pentland is coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6844.501s">[Knight]</a>: However, where we're asking so many questions and we have so many questions, I think it would be better vetted appropriately in the subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6850.604s">[Knight]</a>: I think that we can ask these questions, we can get answers to these questions, then we can convene as a body as a whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6855.612s">[Knight]</a>: and we can make recommendations to the Water and Sewer Commission, instead of asking these questions to the Water and Sewer Commission and not having any opportunity to properly vet it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6863.198s">[Knight]</a>: That's why, Mr. President, I will not be withdrawing my motion to amend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6935.762s">[Knight]</a>: Yes, please, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6942.958s">[Knight]</a>: I'd also like to see the city solicitor present where there are some questions relative to legalities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7078.067s">[Knight]</a>: Um, actually, Mr. President, I think that might make sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7080.728s">[Knight]</a>: If any of us have any questions that we'd like to have answered, that we send those questions to the chairperson of the subcommittee to forward to the water and sewer commission prior to this meeting taking place so that we can get this information to us beforehand and have a productive meeting as Councilor Penter suggested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7094.15s">[Knight]</a>: Valid point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7290.914s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you very much, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7292.375s">[Knight]</a>: And Councilor Caraviello brought this up to my attention, actually, would be also Badger Road in Winthrop, where the Caliaco Construction Company's performing infrastructure improvements to our water and sewer pipes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7302.618s">[Knight]</a>: They're driving over the sidewalk to use that piece of land as a layover land.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7305.939s">[Knight]</a>: And as such, they've caused extensive damage to the curb and siding over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7310.379s">[Knight]</a>: And I believe that's one of the safe routes to schools, Mr. President, so I think that's something that might also need to be looked at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7347.273s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you very much, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7348.814s">[Knight]</a>: Where October is National Disability Awareness Month, I found this resolution to be fitting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7354.131s">[Knight]</a>: We have a number of projects going on, a number of projects that have been completed, whether it's through community development block grant funds or otherwise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7361.572s">[Knight]</a>: We're seeing park improvements and accessibility, sidewalk improvements for accessibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7365.353s">[Knight]</a>: And I'd like the director of disability to have an opportunity to come down here and explain to us exactly what progress they've made over the last year or so in terms of improving accessibility and equal opportunity for the residents here in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7395.348s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you very much, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7396.868s">[Knight]</a>: There are two very proud grandparents in two separate parts of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7400.476s">[Knight]</a>: Many of us know Joan Gatto from the magnificent Muffin and Bagel Shop, and right now I'm sure she's smiling with the birth of her newest grandson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7407.801s">[Knight]</a>: As goes Jean Entapa from over in the hillside area of Medford, an employee at Tufts University, who brings, I believe, her third male grandson into the family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7417.828s">[Knight]</a>: I think she has about six total.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7419.749s">[Knight]</a>: However, Benjamin David Entapa joins his sister Ava and his sister Callie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7425.513s">[Knight]</a>: So we'd like to welcome her to the world and congratulate two proud grandparents, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8147.535s">[Knight]</a>: I think that it's important to point out that all the officers in our department are appropriately trained and the Chief of Police has implemented a number of programs as required by state law and otherwise to ensure the safety of our officers and to ensure the fact that the general public is protected and that, you know, these personnel issues that occur.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8169.196s">[Knight]</a>: in any organization, within any organization, not just within the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8173.658s">[Knight]</a>: So although I appreciate what you're saying, I think that, you know, we're getting a little off base here in terms of, maybe you're losing me here, I'm just trying to figure out what direction you're trying to go in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8182.303s">[Knight]</a>: Maybe if you could, you know, you're talking about staffing levels, you're talking about programming, I'm a little confused as to where you're going here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8187.645s">[Knight]</a>: All of the above.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=425.099s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, motion to revert back to the regular order of business to take care of paper 20-476.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=458.476s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=462.377s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=479.751s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, motion to table the next regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=481.892s">[Knight]</a>: City solicitor was requested to put some language together last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=484.993s">[Knight]</a>: She's not in receipt of that quite yet, so she needs another week to put that together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=489.415s">[Knight]</a>: I'd move for approval to a date certain next regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=492.136s">[Knight]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3051.274s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, if I may?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3054.867s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I just want to take an opportunity to thank Sue and her team from Melrose Wakefield Hospital, the Newton name that they're going by now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3063.43s">[Knight]</a>: But they've done a great job in responding to the council's inquiries, the council's concerns, and always being ready and available to come here to address this body when we have issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3072.874s">[Knight]</a>: So I do want to thank them and commend them for the work that they've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3075.795s">[Knight]</a>: And I look forward to working through some of the design issues that we have and the construction issues that we're having in the neighborhood between now and our next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3982.136s">[Knight]</a>: You read the update, didn't you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=4097.627s">[Knight]</a>: Do these phase three, part two updates that you just gave us relative to capacity extend to the Memphis City Council Chambers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=4118.379s">[Knight]</a>: So there's no limit on the capacity of people, it's just we're exempt from that, you said?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=4131.243s">[Knight]</a>: Okay, so we could have more than 125 people in the council chambers provided that we could maintain safe space?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=4139.586s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6017.408s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6018.949s">[Knight]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6019.129s">[Knight]</a>: O'Connor, based upon the statements that you've made tonight, what is the position of the administration on sending our children back to school, number one, and what role has your office played in determining safe air quality standards in our public school buildings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6091.111s">[Knight]</a>: They're well aware of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6092.312s">[Knight]</a>: Are you aware if the school department is using the recommendations of any medical professional in terms of their moving forward with the air quality examinations and the determination of safe standards?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6124.958s">[Knight]</a>: And what is the position of the administration relative to returning our students back to school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6163.056s">[Knight]</a>: In your professional opinion, do you feel as though the school will be held in an in-person fashion at all this year, or do you think it will be hybrid and remote?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6186.997s">[Knight]</a>: You obviously don't have a child at home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6196.945s">[Knight]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6197.205s">[Knight]</a>: So as of right now, we really don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6206.616s">[Knight]</a>: And Mr. President, I'd like to also offer a C paper because Councilor Caraviello beat me to the punch on the B paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6212.357s">[Knight]</a>: But this C paper would be an ordinance, Mr. President, an emergency ordinance that would say that any school department or city employee who is required to quarantine due to occupational exposure to COVID-19 be placed on paid administrative leave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6226.587s">[Knight]</a>: as opposed to having to use their sick time or their vacation time or their recruiting time, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6231.989s">[Knight]</a>: It's an occupational exposure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6233.39s">[Knight]</a>: It's something that's happened because they're trying to perform the duties of their job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6237.032s">[Knight]</a>: And if that case happens, I don't think it's fair that these individuals should be punished by having to use their sick or vacation time in order to quarantine during these periods of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6244.955s">[Knight]</a>: So I'd ask that that C paper be forwarded to the city solicitor for her to draft up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6275.06s">[Knight]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6276.421s">[Knight]</a>: Any school department or city employee required to quarantine due to occupational exposure to COVID-19?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6281.743s">[Knight]</a>: Okay, hang on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6362.073s">[Knight]</a>: Seems like it's a public policy initiative that's generally accepted by the administration, Mr. President, so I see no harm in memorializing that by way of an emergency ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6396.806s">[Knight]</a>: Just administrative leave doesn't have to be rather than anything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6398.866s">[Knight]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6405.512s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I'd like that to go to the city solicit of a legal review and drafting, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6441.115s">[Knight]</a>: That does it for me, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7668.461s">[Knight]</a>: The thing that's taking place- The information that the speaker is requesting is not under our scope and purview, so we don't have the ability to provide that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7680.233s">[Knight]</a>: The information that the speaker is requesting is not under the scope and purview of the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7684.556s">[Knight]</a>: That information is under the scope and purview of the school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7687.958s">[Knight]</a>: And I know that the teachers union has a lot of concerns and a lot of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7693.602s">[Knight]</a>: And maybe it would be more appropriate for the union to meet with the director of health in a side meeting on this, because I think- So Adam, I hear what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7712.054s">[Knight]</a>: Councilman, are you all done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7713.135s">[Knight]</a>: That was it, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7713.955s">[Knight]</a>: I just thought we were kind of going off a little away from a council meeting and a little bit more into negotiation at that point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7737.264s">[Knight]</a>: Motion to receive and place on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7738.784s">[Knight]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7741.265s">[Knight]</a>: Actually, Mr. President, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7743.086s">[Knight]</a>: Motion to report the questions out, receive the paper, and place on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7745.727s">[Knight]</a>: Still second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8122.367s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8122.928s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, can I ask the petitioner, the council that made the motion to explain the reasoning for the reason to sever?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8148.251s">[Knight]</a>: I'm looking at Chapter 48, Section 51 right now, and it looks to read the same to me under Amendment 1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8165.296s">[Knight]</a>: We want to table the issue so the gentleman can take a look at the legislation, Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8168.817s">[Knight]</a>: The current zoning ordinance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8173.758s">[Knight]</a>: Is that necessary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8174.539s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, you made the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8176.563s">[Knight]</a>: I'm comfortable with the motion as is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8281.158s">[Knight]</a>: It looks to me, Mr. President, like actually- It looks to me like it actually takes away the mapping requirements as outlined in the establishment of the district under 4851A.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8289.165s">[Knight]</a>: This is only an amendment to- Bounded as respectively shown on the map entitled versus under the authority of 40C, the following districts bounded respectively in which are on file in the city clerk's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8307.512s">[Knight]</a>: and made part of this article reference to hereby established.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8310.095s">[Knight]</a>: It takes away the mapped district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8317.802s">[Knight]</a>: It takes out the word map entitled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8321.145s">[Knight]</a>: I'd be happy to re-insert them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8323.767s">[Knight]</a>: So you want to re-insert the same language that's in the existing ordinance to separate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8328.132s">[Knight]</a>: I don't have a problem with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8330.354s">[Knight]</a>: So we're going to strike<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8332.338s">[Knight]</a>: Amendment 1 and replace it with the existing language in 48-51a.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8337.541s">[Knight]</a>: Is that the motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8346.966s">[Knight]</a>: And the map entitled the hillside historic Avenue district and the mom Simmons historic district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8437.717s">[Knight]</a>: It's because I didn't understand it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8438.838s">[Knight]</a>: I didn't understand why we needed the motion to sever the two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8442.122s">[Knight]</a>: However, Mr President, I'll rest my case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8443.724s">[Knight]</a>: I'll just vote no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8451.494s">[Knight]</a>: I don't think he's the city solicitor, Mr President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8765.346s">[Knight]</a>: Can I just ask them to repeat that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8767.368s">[Knight]</a>: They want what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8767.829s">[Knight]</a>: Over the building?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9111.615s">[Knight]</a>: Is it the role of the Historic Commission or the Historic District Commission to establish historic districts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9120.304s">[Knight]</a>: So why would Mr. Haywood be the expert on these questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9303.491s">[Knight]</a>: Is the gentleman a structural engineer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9314.842s">[Knight]</a>: And the architects have the...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9317.83s">[Knight]</a>: professional knowledge and expertise to determine whether or not a structure is salvageable based on the building code and the like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9524.142s">[Knight]</a>: So, Mr. President, so- Counts on eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9527.903s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. Haywood was present at the walkthrough as the chairman of the Medford Historic Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9534.605s">[Knight]</a>: The issue that was before us was whether or not October or something was going to come and go and a demolition permit was going to be issued.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9542.844s">[Knight]</a>: From what I understand, based upon the history that we've all discussed ad nauseum at this point concerning this project, was that he applied for a demolition permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9555.029s">[Knight]</a>: He got his property deemed preferentially preserved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9560.13s">[Knight]</a>: He had his engineer come and say the place can't be salvaged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9565.693s">[Knight]</a>: Where in the process does this design review come into play for the historic commission?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9572.671s">[Knight]</a>: And if the gentleman said, hey, look it, my engineers say the place can't be salvaged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9579.436s">[Knight]</a>: Why did the historic commission wait 17 months to send this to historic district commission?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9585.76s">[Knight]</a>: And then Mr. Haywood from the historic commission is the one that made a representation that I believe if we look at the committee report that this shouldn't be deemed a historic district and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9600.176s">[Knight]</a>: the compromise would be satisfactory and that would be the direction that they would move it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9605.522s">[Knight]</a>: Now, last night, they go before the historic district commission to have the plans looked at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9611.168s">[Knight]</a>: I'm totally confused by this process, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9613.23s">[Knight]</a>: It's an absolute mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9614.691s">[Knight]</a>: It's an absolute mess, in my opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9617.995s">[Knight]</a>: So I'm a little confused as to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9622.591s">[Knight]</a>: The historic district commission doesn't have any design review authority until it becomes a historic district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9627.675s">[Knight]</a>: And by statute, the historic commission has no design review authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9632.678s">[Knight]</a>: And we discussed that at the committee of the whole and the chairman of the committee, the commission acknowledged that they don't have design review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9640.003s">[Knight]</a>: They're not enabled, those powers on the ordinance that they're operating under.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9645.748s">[Knight]</a>: So I'm very confused as to how this is working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9648.451s">[Knight]</a>: It seems to me like it's somewhat being weaponized against the developer or against the builder because he didn't agree that the building could be saved and present plans for them to look at during a 17 month period where there's no real statutory authority for them to have design review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9733.908s">[Knight]</a>: The part that's confusing me is why is it before your board if it's not a historic district commission yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9739.091s">[Knight]</a>: Why is it at the Medford Historic District Commission?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9740.973s">[Knight]</a>: Why is he going to a meeting there presenting plans when it's not a historic district commission?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9745.115s">[Knight]</a>: And the negotiations took place between the historic commission, not the historic district commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9805.907s">[Knight]</a>: Is the administration going to offer that paper to the council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9808.389s">[Knight]</a>: Because the paper that's before us is the paper that the mayor gave us on September 3rd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9820.529s">[Knight]</a>: Paper 20541 is the paper before us offered by Mayor Lungo-Curran to the Memphis City Council September 3rd, 2020.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9829.277s">[Knight]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9829.978s">[Knight]</a>: 33 days ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9956.626s">[Knight]</a>: So I'm confused by this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9957.827s">[Knight]</a>: So the historic commission sent their paperwork to the historic district commission to establish a single home historic district at 16 Foster court and August 28th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9973.799s">[Knight]</a>: The historic district commission took a vote at that August 28th meeting that passed three to zero to move forward with the creation of the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9985.077s">[Knight]</a>: Correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10012.235s">[Knight]</a>: Okay, so then the mayor sends to us this language on September 3rd?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10016.938s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10022.142s">[Knight]</a>: You guys only passed it August 28th, that's pretty good if you ask me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10025.925s">[Knight]</a>: You guys passed it August 28th, the mayor sent it to us September 3rd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10028.527s">[Knight]</a>: I don't think that's too bad, five days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10034.818s">[Knight]</a>: Now, the language that the mayor sent us is the language that you guys never looked at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10038.541s">[Knight]</a>: Is that what I'm understanding?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10039.982s">[Knight]</a>: So you voted for the principle, but you didn't vote for the language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10083.505s">[Knight]</a>: As to what it is that you seek?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10084.946s">[Knight]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10086.581s">[Knight]</a>: But until this 16 foster court is deemed a local historic single home district, what authority does the Medford Historical District Commission have over it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10122.675s">[Knight]</a>: In theory, then, Mr. Goldschneider had no obligation whatsoever to appear before the Historic District Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10133.984s">[Knight]</a>: Where he really should have been would be before the Medford Historic Commission, because that's where the rub lies, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10140.409s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, that's what it sounds to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10168.892s">[Knight]</a>: So, I mean, absent... So for 17 months, the applicant<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10178.371s">[Knight]</a>: sat saying, you know, my engineers say it's a total teardown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10182.575s">[Knight]</a>: My structural engineer says that, you know, there's nothing I can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10185.918s">[Knight]</a>: I have to rip it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10186.899s">[Knight]</a>: I have to pull it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10188.14s">[Knight]</a>: My structural engineer, my expert, who I hired and has paid the money, told me that this is what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10193.905s">[Knight]</a>: So he has an expert opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10196.827s">[Knight]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10197.808s">[Knight]</a>: So at that point in time, when<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10201.673s">[Knight]</a>: he notified the historic commission of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10205.234s">[Knight]</a>: Don't you think it would have made sense that maybe then you moved it forward to the historic district commission instead of dragging it out for 17 months?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10226.699s">[Knight]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10226.939s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, I feel like it's being weaponized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10228.459s">[Knight]</a>: Do what we say or else we're going to cost you a ton of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10265.286s">[Knight]</a>: Sorry to hear that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10266.307s">[Knight]</a>: Can you just tell me what the terms of service are for all the members?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10271.748s">[Knight]</a>: No, in terms of how long they've served.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10273.508s">[Knight]</a>: I'm you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10273.888s">[Knight]</a>: I know that your term is three years, but you've probably been on there for 12.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10279.509s">[Knight]</a>: So how many years have you served on the commission?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10283.655s">[Knight]</a>: 18.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10283.675s">[Knight]</a>: All right, how many years has the next most senior member served?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10296.162s">[Knight]</a>: You're 11?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10310.114s">[Knight]</a>: because that raises some concern, too, when the representative from the historic commission says, well, no one has been paying attention to this for 20 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10318.777s">[Knight]</a>: And then we look at the terms of service of the members that are on the board, and we look at the council resolution from 2014, which asked that single home historic districts be sought after and be proactively identified prior to the request for a demolition permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10335.644s">[Knight]</a>: And that was something that...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10345.775s">[Knight]</a>: It happened at the budget when you were there asking for money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10369.451s">[Knight]</a>: So we were given the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10370.972s">[Knight]</a>: So that was six years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10372.292s">[Knight]</a>: Can you tell me how many single home historic districts you've identified in the past six years, absent the demolition permit or a request from the MCD?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10403.487s">[Knight]</a>: So in 6 years there's been one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10407.87s">[Knight]</a>: Well, this wasn't proactively identified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10409.712s">[Knight]</a>: This was as a result of a demolition permit being pulled and then well, that was this was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10421.822s">[Knight]</a>: By what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10436.757s">[Knight]</a>: I know it's hard to sell a building if nobody knows about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10439.319s">[Knight]</a>: All right, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10452.746s">[Knight]</a>: They own it, aren't they allowed to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10484.542s">[Knight]</a>: I think that's something we'd all appreciate, Mr. President, through you to Mr. Bader.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10490.287s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I do have a last question, and I'll rest my case at this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10493.91s">[Knight]</a>: At the council meeting when this issue was brought up and at the subsequent subcommittee meeting, I did ask a question to the city solicitor as to whether or not the criteria<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10507.081s">[Knight]</a>: the circumstances of this particular property could constitute a regulatory taking, opening up the city of Medford to financial or other liabilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10516.394s">[Knight]</a>: And I'm wondering if you've received a response, or the city clerk maybe has received a response relative to that question of law that we asked the city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10554.764s">[Knight]</a>: The consensus by the four members of the Historical District Commission, the consensus of a land court judge, the consensus of whom?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10565.306s">[Knight]</a>: You said it was the consensus that this is not a regulatory taking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10582.941s">[Knight]</a>: So the district commission conducted a three-prong test to determine whether or not it was a taking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10606.408s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10606.868s">[Knight]</a>: So I think that opinion might be important, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10608.969s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10711.984s">[Knight]</a>: I think I believe that the last meeting I asked for a copy of the letters that was sent to Mr. Goldschneider, inviting him to these 17 consecutive meetings that had him on the agenda that said we're asking you to come and present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10723.189s">[Knight]</a>: Because the way that I see their agenda is that everything that they have going on, they just throw on the agenda and put it out every week and whatever comes up, comes up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10729.812s">[Knight]</a>: So although it might have been on the agenda for 17 months, I don't believe that the gentleman was invited to appear to any of these meetings over that period of time but for one or two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10750.511s">[Knight]</a>: Can the gentleman please provide me with the information that he just received and what expert provided it to him?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10754.233s">[Knight]</a>: A multi-million dollar contract, a multi-million dollar project, a multi-million dollar property?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10758.116s">[Knight]</a>: I think that that's not what I said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10938.463s">[Knight]</a>: Could the clerk provide a record of such communication?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10942.044s">[Knight]</a>: Adopted by the city council in the form of minutes and forwarded to the proper authorities, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10947.896s">[Knight]</a>: Did it happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10949.357s">[Knight]</a>: That's obviously not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11579.619s">[Knight]</a>: Point of information, Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11581.56s">[Knight]</a>: That sounds an awful lot like deliberation to me, Mr. President, absent a public meeting notice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11587.322s">[Knight]</a>: And I think that that's something that we better be very careful of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11592.204s">[Knight]</a>: Individual members of a board of commission passing private notes to the chairman of the commission to be passed on to another board of commission that reflects their opinion, that's done behind closed doors, not in the open sunset of day, I think is a problem, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11606.59s">[Knight]</a>: And I think that that might rise to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11610.848s">[Knight]</a>: the level of violation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11614.03s">[Knight]</a>: And as public employees, we need to be very careful in that regard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11634.08s">[Knight]</a>: Did anybody from the Historical Commission appear before the Historic District Commission and give an opinion as to what they felt?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11643.652s">[Knight]</a>: Was that opinion reflective of the board or the individual?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11660.578s">[Knight]</a>: A member, a chair, same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11663.239s">[Knight]</a>: There's deliberation that's going on behind closed doors, Mr. President, that's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12685.261s">[Knight]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12685.441s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, with all due respect to the councilor, the gentleman's going to have to seek legal advice if he's willing to make that type of commitment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12691.365s">[Knight]</a>: All right, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12725.801s">[Knight]</a>: I did, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12726.701s">[Knight]</a>: Is Mr. Moki available?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12728.882s">[Knight]</a>: He's not available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12729.423s">[Knight]</a>: Is the city solicitor available?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12735.746s">[Knight]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12736.466s">[Knight]</a>: So I guess my question's to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12737.927s">[Knight]</a>: Number one, say that a rendering, say the rendering that we looked at tonight was suitable to both commissions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12747.972s">[Knight]</a>: And they said, move forward and do what you got to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12750.773s">[Knight]</a>: The gentleman would still be subject to site plan review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12754.667s">[Knight]</a>: through our office of community development, which is an open notorious process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12758.829s">[Knight]</a>: During that site plan review process, because his parcel is an apartment two zone district, and there's a single family home there right now, or a two family home right there right now, it's being underutilized land use, number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12770.715s">[Knight]</a>: Number two, because it's a site plan review project, he's gonna be responsible to pay linkage, Mr. President, on top of going through the site plan review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12776.838s">[Knight]</a>: He's also gonna have to pay linkage to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12778.818s">[Knight]</a>: So we're looking at a parcel that's being underutilized, all right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12781.2s">[Knight]</a>: If an apartment building gets built there, which is it's zoned use,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12785.211s">[Knight]</a>: The tax revenues are going to increase, we're going to be able to get linkage, and we still have two more processes in the review of the design that the city has the ability to take a bite at the apple on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12796.847s">[Knight]</a>: I think that the gentleman has,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12800.211s">[Knight]</a>: taken a lot of wax in terms of this whole entire process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12804.775s">[Knight]</a>: And he's maintained his cool a lot better than I would have been able to with the level of frustration that I think he's met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12812.501s">[Knight]</a>: But ultimately, Mr. President, I don't think any of us behind this rail got in the business to hurt people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12817.025s">[Knight]</a>: And the gentleman's being hurt by the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12820.25s">[Knight]</a>: The gentleman's being hurt by the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12821.671s">[Knight]</a>: And regardless of whether or not the process is what it is, it's not a good process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12824.812s">[Knight]</a>: It needs to be fixed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12826.112s">[Knight]</a>: All right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12826.373s">[Knight]</a>: We took a bad vote when we changed the demolition delay from six months to 18 months, in my opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12830.694s">[Knight]</a>: I think it was a bad vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12832.155s">[Knight]</a>: I really do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12832.995s">[Knight]</a>: I also think it was a bad vote when we changed it to any building that was built in the last 75 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12836.917s">[Knight]</a>: I think it was a bad vote, Mr. President, because I feel like what we're doing is not really looking at historic preservation, but what we're looking at doing is a board that's trying to flex its muscles right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12846.921s">[Knight]</a>: All right, we see a board that's trying to increase its level of influence and power in the community because the corner office, we don't have the strongest leader right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12854.271s">[Knight]</a>: So I think, Mr. President, looking at this, you know what I mean, and the way that it's going, there's two more opportunities for design review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12860.239s">[Knight]</a>: The parcel's a strange shaped parcel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12862.823s">[Knight]</a>: It's going to have to go before the zoning board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12865.093s">[Knight]</a>: It's already been noted in the meetings and noted in the discussions, and based upon the plan that's been presented, it's been determined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12872.38s">[Knight]</a>: So this is nothing more, I think, than a power play at this point, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12875.323s">[Knight]</a>: And I certainly thank the Council if I'm moving it to a vote, and I'll be happy to vote against it this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12882.43s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13060.571s">[Knight]</a>: Counsel Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13061.012s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, if I could just offer an amendment to that paper, a re-paper to that amendment, that the administration provide us with a list of whether or not these contracts are being negotiated by internal counsel or external counsel, and the amount of money that they've spent on external counsel, if they have to do such.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13138.71s">[Knight]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13138.87s">[Knight]</a>: And that can be in the form of a B paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13140.231s">[Knight]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13140.992s">[Knight]</a>: It can be in the form of a B paper or an amendment based upon the preference of the sponsor or the person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15069.651s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, the snow and ice account is the only account that we can run a deficit in here in the city of Medford and across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15076.472s">[Knight]</a>: We heard Marsha this morning, it feels like this morning, earlier in the evening when we were talking about the Lawrence Mural Hospital and she gave us a figure of 20% of the community residents are senior citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15088.155s">[Knight]</a>: I know, I just realized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15089.435s">[Knight]</a>: I'm maybe a little high, but close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15092.618s">[Knight]</a>: You know, the city in the past has had a practice of removing the snow in our business districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15097.282s">[Knight]</a>: We've had a bombardier that's gone down the street and down the sidewalks and removed the snow in front of St.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15103.228s">[Knight]</a>: Joseph's all the way down into Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15104.949s">[Knight]</a>: And that's a practice that we've<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15107.111s">[Knight]</a>: Had in the past, and it's a practice that should continue, when we look at the Department of Conservation and Recreation and we see the roadways that are under their control, they have a bombardier that comes out and clears their sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15117.314s">[Knight]</a>: The Department of Conservation and Recreation, a state agency, Mr. President, goes out and does all of their property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15124.255s">[Knight]</a>: I see no reason why the city of Medford should take steps to hold their citizens to a higher standard than that of their DPW and the contractors that they're hiring to pave the streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15136.619s">[Knight]</a>: We can either pass an ordinance that's going to require the citizens to perform the DPW's job, or we can focus on the delivery of services here in the community for the residents and the taxpayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15145.448s">[Knight]</a>: And the way that we do that is by investing in our DPW, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15149.272s">[Knight]</a>: And that's an area that we've historically not invested in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15152.435s">[Knight]</a>: We say, buy this piece of equipment because you're not going to have the manpower.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15155.378s">[Knight]</a>: We're getting to the point now, Mr. President, where we've got more pieces of equipment than we do people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15159.162s">[Knight]</a>: All right, so we're not going to be able to get anything done if we don't look at what's going on, reallocate funds, and refocus what our priorities are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15166.129s">[Knight]</a>: Because our DPW is failing right now, and they're failing because of one reason, manpower.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15171.533s">[Knight]</a>: Manpower, Mr. President, manpower.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15174.356s">[Knight]</a>: We can have over 100 police officers, over 100 firefighters, but not even 50% of that is part of our DPW?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15183.1s">[Knight]</a>: That's a problem, Mr. President, and I don't think that penalizing residents and homeowners because we're making poor decisions in terms of how we allocate funds is going to be the answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15191.987s">[Knight]</a>: So moving forward, Mr. President, I think it's very important that we look at the reasoning behind why fines for commercial properties have doubled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15199.413s">[Knight]</a>: When we look at commercial properties, they pay a higher tax rate than residential properties here in the community, as do industrial properties, because we have a bifurcated tax rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15207.621s">[Knight]</a>: And we have that tax rate for a reason, to keep residential property taxes low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15212.065s">[Knight]</a>: But at the same time, snow removal, snow removal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15214.347s">[Knight]</a>: Why are we punishing a commercial property owner double what we'd be punishing a industrial property owner or a residential property owner?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15222.654s">[Knight]</a>: I don't understand what the importance of singling out a commercial property for double fines is, when the commercial properties are the ones that actually bring jobs to this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15234.281s">[Knight]</a>: They actually allow people to go to work, who live in Medford, can work in Medford, can play in Medford, can spend their ancillary money in the circular floor of our local economy, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15243.867s">[Knight]</a>: So I think it's very important we recognize the role that commercial properties play in our community, and we shouldn't be singling them out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15250.331s">[Knight]</a>: Every time we talk about zoning, we talk about the fact that we're losing commercial properties left and right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15255.032s">[Knight]</a>: We're down to 7 or 8% of the total number of parcels in our community is going to be commercial industrial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15261.094s">[Knight]</a>: Well, if we keep doing stuff like this and penalizing properties for being commercial when instances arise, then we're going to be in a situation where we're going to see less and less of that, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15269.976s">[Knight]</a>: So I think that the fine should be uniform and across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15272.517s">[Knight]</a>: It shouldn't matter what type of parcel you own.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15276.67s">[Knight]</a>: The fines should be the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15278.251s">[Knight]</a>: That coupled with the fact that I really feel as though we should be investing our efforts and our energies in delivering services as a city and as a community, in addressing some of the issues that Councilor Mox brought up about prioritizing our sidewalks and our roadways and ensuring connectivity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15294.386s">[Knight]</a>: But at the same time, not doing it in a punitive fashion so that our residents are being penalized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15300.63s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, I do think this needs a lot of work, and the paper remains in the subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15306.093s">[Knight]</a>: So we could take a vote on this, or we could just say call the subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15310.956s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, the paper's in the subcommittee already from last term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15313.237s">[Knight]</a>: It is what it is, but I'd move for approval on the paper and the amendments, and I'd like to ask that they be consolidated so that we can vote once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15329.387s">[Knight]</a>: I don't know if there's one in public works or public safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15332.288s">[Knight]</a>: It was in public works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15336.229s">[Knight]</a>: If this is really a priority, Mr. President, last week we asked the city clerk to post three meetings, second Tuesday in October, November, and December, for the purpose of the city solicitor appearing before us to talk about ordinances in the ordinance subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15349.364s">[Knight]</a>: This is an ordinance, this is also a venue that we could take it up in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15352.067s">[Knight]</a>: I know Councilor Beals wants to maintain control of it, so he probably wants it in the committee that he chairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15355.851s">[Knight]</a>: I don't want to speak for him, but you know what I mean, it is what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15358.594s">[Knight]</a>: So either way is fine with me, Mr. President, but those meetings are already going to be posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15362.939s">[Knight]</a>: The clerk's already been directed to do such.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15364.601s">[Knight]</a>: So if we want to talk about existing ordinances, then that's a committee that can be referred to as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15377.142s">[Knight]</a>: I don't have a horse in the game, Mr. President, one way or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15379.985s">[Knight]</a>: It's going to have to go to a committee of the whole before it comes to the council floor, pursuant to council rules anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15506.372s">[Knight]</a>: Point of information, Mr. President, just before we start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15508.954s">[Knight]</a>: I'm sorry, point of information, Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15510.756s">[Knight]</a>: It's 20 past 11 at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15512.417s">[Knight]</a>: We have about 17, 18 other items left on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15515.56s">[Knight]</a>: This matter is going to subcommittee to be vetted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15517.462s">[Knight]</a>: It's going to go to committee of the whole to be vetted further, and then it's going to come back to the council floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15522.026s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15523.51s">[Knight]</a>: We're all going to vote in favor to send this thing to the subcommittee to be discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15527.553s">[Knight]</a>: We've already all spoke on it, and we've already all said that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15530.995s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, there'll be ample opportunity for individuals to provide public participation on the topic that's before us here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15538.1s">[Knight]</a>: They're going to have a subcommittee meeting or multiple subcommittee meetings, a committee of the whole meeting, and then it's going to come back to the council floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15544.224s">[Knight]</a>: Right now, the vote we're taking is only to send it to subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15546.665s">[Knight]</a>: I know there are individuals in the community that support this piece of legislation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15550.988s">[Knight]</a>: But I think in the interest of time, Mr. President, it might make sense for us to say, OK, we're going to send it to subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15555.469s">[Knight]</a>: The subcommittee is going to be scheduled, and the matter is going to be deliberated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15560.27s">[Knight]</a>: And then it's going to go to the committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15561.771s">[Knight]</a>: It's going to be scheduled, deliberated again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15563.291s">[Knight]</a>: Then it's going to be put on the council agenda, and going to move forward again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15566.272s">[Knight]</a>: So everybody's going to have an ample opportunity to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15568.532s">[Knight]</a>: We would have been done by now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16010.345s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16012.866s">[Knight]</a>: In review of the common practice of the council, it's always been that the special permit for extended hours would be granted to the business and not the property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16024.512s">[Knight]</a>: And the business is changing hands, which would require an application for a second<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16032.02s">[Knight]</a>: An application for a permit for extended hours, if I'm not mistaken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16035.301s">[Knight]</a>: So I guess, can the city clerk clarify or confirm whether or not when this initial permit was issued, it was issued to the property or to the business?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16043.682s">[Knight]</a>: And if it was issued to the business, then I believe they'd be required to come back before us for extended hours permit for any operation before 7 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16050.784s">[Knight]</a>: or after 11 p.m., right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16061.391s">[Knight]</a>: And I don't want to hold it up, Mr. President, so I have no problem moving for approval, provided that the clerk gives us the information that we're requesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16071.818s">[Knight]</a>: And if an extended hours permit is necessary, he contacts the business owner prior to their opening and informs them of the process that they need to go through to obtain an extended hours permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16106.952s">[Knight]</a>: It's an operation of government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16108.093s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, if the permit was issued, what they're asking for right now, they can't get if they're not grandfathered in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16114.695s">[Knight]</a>: If they are grandfathered in, they can get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16120.938s">[Knight]</a>: Yeah, let's confirm what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16123.039s">[Knight]</a>: We'll move for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16124.32s">[Knight]</a>: The license is going to be, I'm under the impression it's going to be 7 to 11, unless otherwise with the restrictions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16130.622s">[Knight]</a>: And if not, then the clerk will notify them and have them come back before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16168.93s">[Knight]</a>: Along with the review, Mr. President, I'd like to ask that the permit go with the business entity and not the address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16174.652s">[Knight]</a>: If in fact we need to address the extended hours permit going forward, whether or not there's a way that we can put a mechanism in place so that it now goes with the business and doesn't stay with the process, whether that requires a rescinding of a vote, previous vote or not, but to protect the neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17045.819s">[Knight]</a>: I am all set, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17050.18s">[Knight]</a>: So does this mean they're not going to change the direction of South Street like they were talking about three years ago?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17054.362s">[Knight]</a>: We're going to get the speed bumps instead?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17056.142s">[Knight]</a>: One phone call, Councilor Marks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17057.302s">[Knight]</a>: Great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17060.663s">[Knight]</a>: No, Mr. President, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17062.904s">[Knight]</a>: I think it's important also that because this is an issue of funding coming from partners in state government that we make sure that Representative Donato's informed every step of the way on what efforts we're making as a council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17075.194s">[Knight]</a>: This money didn't get released or given to us because we're good people and we're a nice community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17080.558s">[Knight]</a>: They got released because we were sending them letters once every two months asking them to look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17085.142s">[Knight]</a>: We were bringing our chief of police down there and we were telling them do something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17087.764s">[Knight]</a>: We were looking at statistics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17090.005s">[Knight]</a>: So I think it's very important, Mr. President, that in order to keep the momentum going, that we have our partners in government at the state level involved in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17097.007s">[Knight]</a>: And Representative Donato's been a champion on this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17101.289s">[Knight]</a>: He's been very outspoken in his support for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17103.149s">[Knight]</a>: So I just ask that any time a correspondence goes out relative to the furtherance of this initiative that Representative Donato's offered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17121.618s">[Knight]</a>: He's in a very powerful position, Mr. President, so I think that it's important that he be involved in these conversations as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17128.299s">[Knight]</a>: As the assistant majority leader, he's going to have the ability to control some purse strings and get us some money, and he's done a great job of that in the past, and I'm sure he'll continue to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17135.801s">[Knight]</a>: So I'd ask that he be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18137.504s">[Knight]</a>: Again, Mr. President, the way that things have gone down with the Historical Commission in the past, oh, eight, nine months would lead me to believe that I don't want them to do anything other than what they were doing before what they were doing the last eight or nine months ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18149.967s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, I'm opposed to Councilor Caviello's measure this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18153.947s">[Knight]</a>: I feel as though the Historical Commission is exceeding their authority underneath the statute and the efforts and endeavors that they've undertaken in recent months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18161.229s">[Knight]</a>: And for that reason, I will be opposing this this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18238.344s">[Knight]</a>: One more information, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18253.855s">[Knight]</a>: It's problematic, Mr. President, when everybody that you talk to says they're having some sort of problem getting a permit, some sort of problem getting a permit, unless they know somebody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18262.301s">[Knight]</a>: They call a city councilor and then they get, oh yeah, it's no problem, I'll get you in a half an hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18265.764s">[Knight]</a>: If they don't know somebody, though, they're held up for 17 months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18269.369s">[Knight]</a>: All right, that's a problem, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18271.25s">[Knight]</a>: I feel as though that's a very big problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18273.31s">[Knight]</a>: I also think it's a problem that, you know, there's no guidance from the administration as to how this process is supposed to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18279.933s">[Knight]</a>: So now Paul Moky's supposed to notify someone or the building commissioner, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18285.475s">[Knight]</a>: The building department's supposed to notify residents which have had their buildings permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18289.096s">[Knight]</a>: permits reviewed by the historical commission within 72 hours after the review has been completed of the decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18295.259s">[Knight]</a>: Nothing prompts the historical commission to notify the building commissioner within a defined period of time when they get the application or after they make their decision to tell the building commissioner when it is that they can pull the trigger on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18307.284s">[Knight]</a>: This is a flawed process from the start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18308.945s">[Knight]</a>: The changes that have been implemented over the last year, Mr. President, are detrimental to the growth in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18378.952s">[Knight]</a>: I mean, if your application is before a board or a commission and they vote on it, the board of commission should be the one telling you what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18384.256s">[Knight]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18405.247s">[Knight]</a>: There needs to be, someone needs to define who's responsible for issuing a building permit in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18410.928s">[Knight]</a>: I think that's the building commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18412.368s">[Knight]</a>: It always has been in the past, just like he's always been the person responsible for zoning, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18417.369s">[Knight]</a>: So I think that although the council feels as though I'm comparing apples to oranges, I don't think that's necessarily the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18425.331s">[Knight]</a>: I feel as though I'm comparing overstep and overstep based upon the statutory guidelines and the ordinance that's in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18431.826s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18478.149s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, but again, the mechanism is when is the building department getting notified when the determination is being made?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18485.212s">[Knight]</a>: And is there a criteria or a timeline for when that determination needs to be made from the ancillary secondary body?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18491.57s">[Knight]</a>: So can I get a building permit and go give it to Paul Moki and he says, OK, yeah, this has to go to Historic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18497.113s">[Knight]</a>: He gives it to Historic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18498.373s">[Knight]</a>: Historic has a meeting on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18499.734s">[Knight]</a>: Neva tells him about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18500.795s">[Knight]</a>: Or Historic doesn't have a meeting on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18502.115s">[Knight]</a>: It has a meeting on it in 45 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18503.916s">[Knight]</a>: Are there any defined parameters or timelines?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18507.338s">[Knight]</a>: That's the concern, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18509.339s">[Knight]</a>: There's a breakdown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18526.845s">[Knight]</a>: Point of information, Mr. President, I think it's been made clear by the council is that as long as you know a counselor and pick up the phone, there is no breakdown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18531.686s">[Knight]</a>: But if you don't know a counselor and you can't pick up the phone, then there is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18610.324s">[Knight]</a>: Motion to receive and place on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18611.365s">[Knight]</a>: It's a move point, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18612.566s">[Knight]</a>: We took the vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18735.355s">[Knight]</a>: Is there a committee report?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18740.457s">[Knight]</a>: Is there one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18744.679s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18814.975s">[Knight]</a>: Motion to take papers in the hands of the clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18816.816s">[Knight]</a>: No, we have two more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=19237.847s">[Knight]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=99.433s">[Knight]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=133.539s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I move to take paper 2013 out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=137.261s">[Knight]</a>: This was a paper that was before the council previously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=139.383s">[Knight]</a>: We sent it back to the mayor with a request for amendment and it has come back as<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=144.315s">[Knight]</a>: The council amended it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=145.075s">[Knight]</a>: I'd like to ask a representative from the administration to come up and just give us a brief synopsis of the paper that's before us, and then hopefully move for a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=180.035s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I do believe, Mr. President, that the special revenue fund was a recommendation that was made by the Division of Local Services from the Department of Revenue to establish generally accepted accounting practices on how to spend the funds that come with these host community agreements and community impact agreements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=195.918s">[Knight]</a>: Based upon the language that's been provided to us and the review of the language that's been provided to us previously, it seems as though everything's in order and the recommendations of the council have been adopted by the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=204.839s">[Knight]</a>: As such, I'd move for approval of the paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=209.284s">[Knight]</a>: On the motion of- No, no, it's actually a home rule petition, it's going to the legislature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=214.386s">[Knight]</a>: It's a home rule petition, so it will go to the legislature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=266.21s">[Knight]</a>: Yes, we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=267.091s">[Knight]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1516.658s">[Knight]</a>: restricted available funds used to supplement the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1520.641s">[Knight]</a>: By definition that's what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1524.663s">[Knight]</a>: Motion to receive and place on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2010.135s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2011.476s">[Knight]</a>: Last term when this council did adopt the increase from $20,000 to $40,000, which passed unanimously before the body, we raised a question to the city assessor asking her to conduct a cost analysis and feasibility study of adopting the state maximum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2028.242s">[Knight]</a>: She reported back to us, I believe, right around the time we were setting the tax rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2033.517s">[Knight]</a>: that she was still working on that document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2036.1s">[Knight]</a>: So I'd just like to add the paper that the council had adopted back in March of 2019, I'm sorry, May of 2019, I believe it was either the 20th or the 28th in that meeting, making that request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2048.192s">[Knight]</a>: And add that to the agenda as part of the discussion, Mr. President, because if we're going to make a decision about this type of issue that's going to have a certain impact on our finances here in the community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2058.48s">[Knight]</a>: then at the very least we need to have a feasibility study or a cost impact analysis done so that we have an understanding of what impact it's going to have on the bottom line in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2069.164s">[Knight]</a>: So my motion would be to join that paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2074.086s">[Knight]</a>: To include it as part of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2075.386s">[Knight]</a>: It doesn't necessarily have to be joined to this paper tonight, but when the meeting is conducted, that it's conducted when we have the cost analysis and feasibility study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4193.481s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I believe it was early in December that we were up here singing Rosemary praises for her recent achievement being named Medford's 2019 Citizen of the Year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4202.814s">[Knight]</a>: And as such, just recently, at the end of this month, earlier this month, she celebrated a very momentous birthday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4209.661s">[Knight]</a>: So it's been quite a year for Rosemary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4211.623s">[Knight]</a>: She became a citizen of the year and an octogenarian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4214.487s">[Knight]</a>: I'd like to wish her a very happy 80th birthday and ask my council colleagues to join her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4429.646s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4431.808s">[Knight]</a>: Paper 17321 was introduced in 2017 before the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4436.312s">[Knight]</a>: It had gone through a subcommittee process and was a paper that was reported out favorably by the subcommittee on ordinances, I do believe, and then was never scheduled for a committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4446.241s">[Knight]</a>: And that was a paper that was also designed to regulate drop boxes here in the community of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4451.665s">[Knight]</a>: During the deliberations and discussions of this issue, one thing came up that was very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4457.43s">[Knight]</a>: We have a textile recycling fundraising program at our elementary schools and our middle schools and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4467.352s">[Knight]</a>: facilities exemption was something that was very important at the time, and I'm sure that still holds true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4472.934s">[Knight]</a>: So moving forward, if we're going to regulate donation drop boxes by way of ordinance, I'd just like to request that school and city facilities be excluded from the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4489.701s">[Knight]</a>: That would be an amendment to the main paper, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5380.06s">[Knight]</a>: Point of information, Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5382.502s">[Knight]</a>: I think it's important to point out that this council sued the Board of Appeals relative to that decision that they made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5387.086s">[Knight]</a>: We took this case to court and we lost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5388.608s">[Knight]</a>: We were found to not have standing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5409.175s">[Knight]</a>: The Medford City Council filed suit and was thrown out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5412.638s">[Knight]</a>: And the land court judge had found the city legislative body had zero standing to appeal the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5428.791s">[Knight]</a>: We got thrown out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5432.153s">[Knight]</a>: We spent $60,000 to be told we didn't have standing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5437.601s">[Knight]</a>: Then the question was, are we going to spend another 60 grand to be told that again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5441.667s">[Knight]</a>: But I rest my case, but I just wanted to point out the factual history of the process and what went down with Locust Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5447.449s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you, Councilman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5448.35s">[Knight]</a>: We weren't sitting back on our hands saying, oh, Locust Street's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5451.191s">[Knight]</a>: That's not what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5451.891s">[Knight]</a>: We sued the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5452.631s">[Knight]</a>: We sued the zoning board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5477.739s">[Knight]</a>: I believe it was 40, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5479.14s">[Knight]</a>: And we weren't, we weren't, we weren't, uh, you know, co-defendants or co-appellants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5483.962s">[Knight]</a>: We were an individual entity that moved forward as a, in a silo, not with the neighborhood, not with anybody else, but we're in the best interest of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5828.88s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I support the resolution wholeheartedly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5830.921s">[Knight]</a>: I do think it's important to point out that if the council does have in fact legal counsel to provide it with legal opinions, the legal opinions relative to ethics and the like would have to come from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5842.648s">[Knight]</a>: Statutorily, the city solicitor's office, we can't have our own council giving us opinions related to that, but we can use this person for the very important job of drafting framework ordinances, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5852.63s">[Knight]</a>: That's something we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5853.971s">[Knight]</a>: It's something, you know, just in the very short time that we've been meeting as a council, we've taken, you know, several resolutions that have been filed that we've been asking for draft ordinances to be put together on that have been two and three and four years in the making, not because the city solicitor wasn't able to do it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5872.152s">[Knight]</a>: Capability-wise, it was because he has to run the everyday operations of an entire city, as well as, you know, that he had the requests that this body makes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5881.957s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, I think that this is a step in the right direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5884.458s">[Knight]</a>: It was my number two priority, Mr. President, when we talked about council priorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5888.219s">[Knight]</a>: Number one, improving the way we deliver services here in this community, making sure that when you pick up the phone and call because your trash barrel wasn't picked up, that someone comes and picks it up for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5896.023s">[Knight]</a>: When you say there's a pothole in front of your house, it gets fixed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5898.344s">[Knight]</a>: When your sidewalk needs to be repaired, it gets done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5900.445s">[Knight]</a>: Number one priority, service delivery and improving the way we do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5902.927s">[Knight]</a>: Number two priority, getting counsel for the Medford City Council so that we can put out a better work product at a faster pace, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5930.94s">[Knight]</a>: Do need this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5932.32s">[Knight]</a>: We do really need this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5933.761s">[Knight]</a>: It's not something that we don't really need, Mr. Strehler, it's something that we do really need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5937.523s">[Knight]</a>: You know, when you're looking at the number of draft ordinances that we've requested just since this body's met this term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5942.793s">[Knight]</a>: We're looking at nine, nine draft ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5944.895s">[Knight]</a>: That's more, nine ordinances is more of a work product than we put out in a term, and I can't tell you in how long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5950.78s">[Knight]</a>: If we get those draft ordinances produced to us, I guarantee you we're gonna put out a stronger work product than we have in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5955.284s">[Knight]</a>: If we have some council that's working for us, dedicated X amount of hours a week, putting those work products out, I guarantee you we're gonna do more work than we've done in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5999.715s">[Knight]</a>: I think if you look at the ordinances before you, it says that the issue of funding for the City Council to hire an additional legal services line item be discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6007.379s">[Knight]</a>: Now, I think it's also important to point out, Mr. President, that Mayor Burke<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6010.407s">[Knight]</a>: during this fiscal year has already committed to us $40,000 for professional and legal services in the form of a zoning consultant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6016.63s">[Knight]</a>: That money's never actually been transferred into our line item for professional legal services in the city council's budget and the budget of the legislative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6024.133s">[Knight]</a>: It sits in a revolving fund for special services that lays in the auditor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6029.654s">[Knight]</a>: So, with that being said, you know, we already have funds that are available to us that have been committed to us and have been budgeted to us for the purposes of legal or professional technical services, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6037.702s">[Knight]</a>: I think what we're looking at doing is figuring out a way that we can best capture these funds and start utilizing them so that we can put out a stronger work product.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6109.758s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6111.683s">[Knight]</a>: Everybody that knows me knows I love my amichis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6114.812s">[Knight]</a>: Probably once a week at least, I go down to amichis and get.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6118.496s">[Knight]</a>: couple slices of pizza before I make my way up here to the city council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6121.937s">[Knight]</a>: I'll get two slices of cheese with that great, you know, sauce-cheese ratio and the great flop that they have down there at Amici's, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6129.039s">[Knight]</a>: But a couple weeks ago when I was getting out of my car to pick up my dinner before I came to the council meeting, I noticed that the drainage issue right in front of Amici's, recently they had a complete streets program down there and they did a bump out in the curb right where Amici's and Paul Revere's is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6144.924s">[Knight]</a>: And that bumped out, but the gradient isn't conducive to proper drainage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6149.573s">[Knight]</a>: So what's going on, Mr. President, is the water's pooling and it's becoming at least five, six, seven inches deep at some point, which renders that parking spot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6159.451s">[Knight]</a>: And that's the parking spot that sits right out in front of, you know, four businesses that specialize in takeout food, Hong Kong Village, CB Scoops, Amici's, and Paul Revere's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6170.278s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, it's having a negative impact on the businesses that worked on, that are operating down in West Bedford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6176.602s">[Knight]</a>: Also, when they did this complete streets project and they did put the bump out in, they took away a parking spot and a half.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6181.866s">[Knight]</a>: So to add, you know, insult to injury, on top of losing a parking spot, now there's another parking spot there that is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6188.73s">[Knight]</a>: virtually useless to the business district in times of inclement weather.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6192.391s">[Knight]</a>: So I'm asking that the engineering department take the appropriate steps to hold the contractor accountable that did the work and get them back out there to fix it so that the fine people that are trying to get a nice slice of pizza down there in West Memphis Square are able to do so, Mr. President.<br><br>
