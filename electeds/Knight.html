    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=646.029s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you very much, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=647.389s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Knox, for bringing this resolution forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=650.154s">[Knight]</a>: I think this is a great proactive approach to improving the quality of life for residents here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=655.677s">[Knight]</a>: I will be voting in favor of this resolution and I might ask that the resolution be amended by way of a B paper, Mr. President, which would ask that the Medford police or the building department report back to this council locations that have been reported to have been graffitied within the last 12 months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=670.025s">[Knight]</a>: I think it's very important that we keep track of this data to determine whether or not there were clusters and trends that are occurring here in the city so that we know where to ramp up enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=677.233s">[Knight]</a>: So I'd like to thank Councilor Marks for taking such a proactive approach to looking at the quality of life in this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=682.416s">[Knight]</a>: And I will be voting in favor of this resolution, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=684.878s">[Knight]</a>: I just ask that it be amended for the Police Department of the powers that be to report back any locations that have been reported within the last calendar year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4365.073s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you very much, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4366.86s">[Knight]</a>: I think it's very important that we recognize the efforts and the leadership that Councilman Marks has put forward on the issue of a dog park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4373.064s">[Knight]</a>: Not only has he brought this issue to the council floor, he's actually put his money where his mouth is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4376.886s">[Knight]</a>: He's gone out, I witnessed him personally collecting signatures from members in this community to seek support for a dog park, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4384.75s">[Knight]</a>: And that's the proactive grassroots type of work that makes the community really come together and it makes matters like this come to fruition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4393.625s">[Knight]</a>: I'd like to congratulate Councilor Marks on the efforts that he's put forward, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4396.886s">[Knight]</a>: Not only does he file the resolutions, but he does the legwork.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5602.964s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you very much, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5608.789s">[Knight]</a>: taken a big interest in recent weeks to the water and sewer billing system and the rates that are in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5613.89s">[Knight]</a>: And in my research, I've been able to determine that in 2006, of the MWRA communities, Medford was the 15th highest consumer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5624.413s">[Knight]</a>: And it's also my understanding that a tiered rate system is put in place to promote conservation of use of water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5631.815s">[Knight]</a>: Previous councils, dating back as far as I've looked to 2007, have consistently voted to establish a tiered rate system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5638.312s">[Knight]</a>: We have paper 07464 to establish a tiered rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5642.034s">[Knight]</a>: Paper 07559 to establish a progressive H2O consumption system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5648.296s">[Knight]</a>: Paper 08591, the city engineer present the tiered system for the council to review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5653.418s">[Knight]</a>: 09535, a report on the tiered rate system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5655.779s">[Knight]</a>: 09706, creation of a tiered system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5657.18s">[Knight]</a>: 09838, an excessive use of water program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5658.82s">[Knight]</a>: 10036, the status of a tiered rate system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5669.347s">[Knight]</a>: 720, report back on the progress of creating a tiered system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5673.769s">[Knight]</a>: Dating back to 12-4-07, the Medford City Council has been on record in supporting looking at water and sewer rates and eyeing a multi-tiered system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5682.772s">[Knight]</a>: As recently as 12-24, Mr. President, there was an article in the Medford transcript saying that the City Council supported the implementation of a tiered system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5689.495s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Mayorka was a champion for such a program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5692.016s">[Knight]</a>: Councilor Mayorka was of the theory that if you use more, you pay more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5695.397s">[Knight]</a>: And I certainly agree with that philosophy, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5699.13s">[Knight]</a>: In looking at how the rates are determined, we have a Water and Sewer Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5703.072s">[Knight]</a>: The Water and Sewer Commission meets monthly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5704.994s">[Knight]</a>: Here in my city council packet this week, I received a notice of when this Water and Sewer Commission is going to meet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5710.597s">[Knight]</a>: For the edification of the people at home, I'd like to let them know that on October 15, 2014, in room 201, at 2 o'clock, the Water and Sewer Commission will be meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5718.982s">[Knight]</a>: It's open to the public and all members can attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5721.204s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I certainly share some concerns about the itemization of the bill, and I too have seen irregularities in water bills, my own included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5727.504s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5728.084s">[Knight]</a>: However, I think to say that this is a surprise is a little bit of a misconstrue of what's happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5735.528s">[Knight]</a>: It's not in line with what the history shows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5737.448s">[Knight]</a>: It's not in line with what the history says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5819.174s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you very much, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5820.535s">[Knight]</a>: And I was getting there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5821.776s">[Knight]</a>: I think that, you know, when we get a response from the mayor saying to call a public hearings within the council purview, it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5827.522s">[Knight]</a>: We have subcommittees, we have committees, committees of the whole, which has the power to call a committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5833.168s">[Knight]</a>: We have a committee on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5834.744s">[Knight]</a>: auditing finance, budget, and taxation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5836.444s">[Knight]</a>: We have a subcommittee on intergovernmental affairs, and I think that when we call for a public hearing, we don't need to have the permission of the mayor to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5842.546s">[Knight]</a>: We can use our internal governmental structure that we have here as a council in order to promote these meetings, in order to make these meetings happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5848.968s">[Knight]</a>: So when I looked at it and I saw that it falls within the council purview, and then I read the language in the resolution, I said, well, I think that this refers to the fact that the council does have the power to call this meeting, and we don't need the mayor to give us authority to do such.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5859.67s">[Knight]</a>: And that's where I'm coming from, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5861.131s">[Knight]</a>: I certainly feel as though we need to have a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5863.427s">[Knight]</a>: better line of communication in terms of the way that our water and sewer billing is implemented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5868.888s">[Knight]</a>: And I certainly have concerns, because when we look at 2007, we look at the ideas that came out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5873.569s">[Knight]</a>: And the tiered system was really 0 to 1,000 cubic feet of use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5877.87s">[Knight]</a>: And it's gone down to 800.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5879.391s">[Knight]</a>: So I can understand that there must have been some deliberation and some decision-making process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5883.012s">[Knight]</a>: And I, too, share the concerns as to how do we get to this figure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5885.932s">[Knight]</a>: It's my understanding that, based upon conversations that I've had with members of the Water Sewer Commission, that about two-thirds of the households in the city will fall in the first tier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5894.149s">[Knight]</a>: I haven't seen any hard facts and hard figures on that, but that's what's been represented to me through the conversations that I've had with the Water and Sewer Commission, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5900.893s">[Knight]</a>: So with that being said, I certainly do not see any reason for us to go to the mayor's office and ask the mayor for permission to hold a hearing on this when we have a perfect structure that's in place that's underutilized right now in order to do such.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5911.159s">[Knight]</a>: So I would move, Mr. President, this be forwarded to one of the appropriate subcommittees that we have here that's in existence already for us to actually take ownership of the issue and get the answers that we need without relying on somebody else giving them to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5921.084s">[Knight]</a>: We can go and extract them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6413.158s">[Knight]</a>: Counselor Mack.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6413.598s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you very much, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6415.079s">[Knight]</a>: I echo the sentiments relative to infrastructure that Counselor Max has raised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6420.515s">[Knight]</a>: Our MWRA assessment is calculated every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6422.897s">[Knight]</a>: It's done so by the MWRA estimating the total amount of revenue that's going to be necessary for them to run their water system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6429.603s">[Knight]</a>: The chart is then calculated at a flat rate times the metered water used in a community, and that's how they come up with their assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6435.368s">[Knight]</a>: However, it's interesting to point out that debt service represents 60% of the FY15 budget at the MWRA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6439.992s">[Knight]</a>: So that means 60%<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6443.826s">[Knight]</a>: of their budget is dedicated just to debt service for infrastructure improvements that they've made to deliver these water to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6449.128s">[Knight]</a>: So I think it's time that we need to take a look internally and say, OK, now it's time for us to make this commitment to our infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6454.589s">[Knight]</a>: Because ultimately, in the long run, it is going to reduce the cost for the individuals in this community to pay water bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6841.74s">[Knight]</a>: Mr. President, I do appreciate where Councillor Pentland is coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6844.501s">[Knight]</a>: However, where we're asking so many questions and we have so many questions, I think it would be better vetted appropriately in the subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6850.604s">[Knight]</a>: I think that we can ask these questions, we can get answers to these questions, then we can convene as a body as a whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6855.612s">[Knight]</a>: and we can make recommendations to the Water and Sewer Commission, instead of asking these questions to the Water and Sewer Commission and not having any opportunity to properly vet it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6863.198s">[Knight]</a>: That's why, Mr. President, I will not be withdrawing my motion to amend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6935.762s">[Knight]</a>: Yes, please, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6942.958s">[Knight]</a>: I'd also like to see the city solicitor present where there are some questions relative to legalities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7078.067s">[Knight]</a>: Um, actually, Mr. President, I think that might make sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7080.728s">[Knight]</a>: If any of us have any questions that we'd like to have answered, that we send those questions to the chairperson of the subcommittee to forward to the water and sewer commission prior to this meeting taking place so that we can get this information to us beforehand and have a productive meeting as Councilor Penter suggested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7094.15s">[Knight]</a>: Valid point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7290.914s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you very much, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7292.375s">[Knight]</a>: And Councilor Caraviello brought this up to my attention, actually, would be also Badger Road in Winthrop, where the Caliaco Construction Company's performing infrastructure improvements to our water and sewer pipes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7302.618s">[Knight]</a>: They're driving over the sidewalk to use that piece of land as a layover land.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7305.939s">[Knight]</a>: And as such, they've caused extensive damage to the curb and siding over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7310.379s">[Knight]</a>: And I believe that's one of the safe routes to schools, Mr. President, so I think that's something that might also need to be looked at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7347.273s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you very much, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7348.814s">[Knight]</a>: Where October is National Disability Awareness Month, I found this resolution to be fitting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7354.131s">[Knight]</a>: We have a number of projects going on, a number of projects that have been completed, whether it's through community development block grant funds or otherwise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7361.572s">[Knight]</a>: We're seeing park improvements and accessibility, sidewalk improvements for accessibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7365.353s">[Knight]</a>: And I'd like the director of disability to have an opportunity to come down here and explain to us exactly what progress they've made over the last year or so in terms of improving accessibility and equal opportunity for the residents here in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7395.348s">[Knight]</a>: Thank you very much, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7396.868s">[Knight]</a>: There are two very proud grandparents in two separate parts of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7400.476s">[Knight]</a>: Many of us know Joan Gatto from the magnificent Muffin and Bagel Shop, and right now I'm sure she's smiling with the birth of her newest grandson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7407.801s">[Knight]</a>: As goes Jean Entapa from over in the hillside area of Medford, an employee at Tufts University, who brings, I believe, her third male grandson into the family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7417.828s">[Knight]</a>: I think she has about six total.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7419.749s">[Knight]</a>: However, Benjamin David Entapa joins his sister Ava and his sister Callie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7425.513s">[Knight]</a>: So we'd like to welcome her to the world and congratulate two proud grandparents, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8147.535s">[Knight]</a>: I think that it's important to point out that all the officers in our department are appropriately trained and the Chief of Police has implemented a number of programs as required by state law and otherwise to ensure the safety of our officers and to ensure the fact that the general public is protected and that, you know, these personnel issues that occur.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8169.196s">[Knight]</a>: in any organization, within any organization, not just within the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8173.658s">[Knight]</a>: So although I appreciate what you're saying, I think that, you know, we're getting a little off base here in terms of, maybe you're losing me here, I'm just trying to figure out what direction you're trying to go in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8182.303s">[Knight]</a>: Maybe if you could, you know, you're talking about staffing levels, you're talking about programming, I'm a little confused as to where you're going here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8187.645s">[Knight]</a>: All of the above.<br><br>
