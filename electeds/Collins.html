    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4211.496s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Penny, for being here tonight and for presenting, you know, some of the process and progress that's gone into the work that this grant has enabled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4219.101s">[Collins]</a>: I think, you know, over the past year, this grant, I mean, I know it's gone on for more than the past year, but, you know, what's come out of this has been one of the things that I, you know, feel most proud of in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4229.067s">[Collins]</a>: It's really great to be able to see some first steps towards language equity, doing a better job of reaching out to the people who, you know, historically do not show up to City Hall,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4238.154s">[Collins]</a>: are not reached out to, don't speak the language, you know, in whatever way, I think this is really important work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4242.997s">[Collins]</a>: And it's great to get sort of these concrete facts about what specifically has been done, what the grant has enabled the city to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4250.24s">[Collins]</a>: I think that it's important for us to get a picture of what doing that work of bringing more of the community into community spaces, how that breaks down into roles and positions and programs, kind of gives those numbers some context.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4265.466s">[Collins]</a>: You know, as a, as a counselor, and I know that you in your office, you, you, you get this, you know, 10 times more than, than we do, but, you know, we hear from people looking for housing, we hear from people who are looking for pro bono legal representation, you know, the eviction crisis in Medford square several months ago, eviction help, you know, tenant organizing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4283.34s">[Collins]</a>: I'm been very involved with the mutual aid network for several years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4286.122s">[Collins]</a>: You know, I, what strikes me every time these conversations come up is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4290.461s">[Collins]</a>: It seems like over and over again, we hit against the fact that even our provider network are very close to hitting their bandwidth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4298.743s">[Collins]</a>: And I know that it's in my mind so strongly all the time that our regional network of providers is inundated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4308.625s">[Collins]</a>: There's so much need, you said for housing, food insecurity, there's so much need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4312.366s">[Collins]</a>: And I know that that's one of the many things that we need a regional approach for, we need more state assistance for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4318.908s">[Collins]</a>: Where this comes in as I think,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4320.558s">[Collins]</a>: Given that it's so important for us to streamline on the local level as much as possible to make sure that everybody in our community who needs those resources can access them in an easy way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4329.322s">[Collins]</a>: I think this program is doing that and that everybody in the community can have equitable access to the resources that are available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4335.745s">[Collins]</a>: And I really hope that that work can continue in parallel with, you know, regionally and with our other providers working to make sure that we have more places to direct people to, you know, I'm sure it's heartbreaking for your staff every time you have to say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4349.366s">[Collins]</a>: I can get you on that wait list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4350.426s">[Collins]</a>: I can get you on that list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4351.507s">[Collins]</a>: I can't wait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4352.007s">[Collins]</a>: I can't get you on that wait list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4353.107s">[Collins]</a>: And I'm sure that's, I'm sure that's really hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4355.348s">[Collins]</a>: So I just thank you for, thank you for this work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4357.349s">[Collins]</a>: I'm really excited to see how it continues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4358.949s">[Collins]</a>: And like vice president Behr said, so any way this council can support you and continue that work, you know, we're partners with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5659.556s">[Collins]</a>: I just wanted to thank you for coming before us for having these numbers prepared and for your candor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5664.038s">[Collins]</a>: I think we all know that when you took the job here, you didn't sign up for a cakewalk, but we all know how much is on your plates with catching up from our financial backlog, reconciling everything, and we don't want<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5679.025s">[Collins]</a>: you know, your, your role in, in, in getting us up to speed to be any more, you know, painful than it has to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5685.269s">[Collins]</a>: So I'm hoping that, you know, I'm looking forward to the presentation in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5688.211s">[Collins]</a>: I really appreciate, you know, your help in dialing down how to get us what we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5692.595s">[Collins]</a>: And I hope that, you know, at that presentation and the committee of the whole, if we refer it there, we can also at that point kind of assess what do we need going forward to make sure that this back and forth between the council and your offices, you know, having communication wise, what it needs,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5706.817s">[Collins]</a>: just to make sure that that's as streamlined as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5708.699s">[Collins]</a>: So again, thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5710.48s">[Collins]</a>: We do really appreciate your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7294.493s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7296.434s">[Collins]</a>: You know, mostly right now, I want to, I know there are community members in the room, I want to hear<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7301.169s">[Collins]</a>: from community members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7303.551s">[Collins]</a>: But I just wanted to say at the outset, you know, yesterday's incident was heartbreaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7308.394s">[Collins]</a>: It's traumatizing during an already extremely raw and difficult time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7316.219s">[Collins]</a>: These events affect the whole community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7318.801s">[Collins]</a>: As leaders, I think it's our responsibility to hear from people who are the most affected, the students, the families, teachers, and staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7324.705s">[Collins]</a>: I think we can all agree, nothing is more important than our public schools being safe and stable and supportive<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7331.007s">[Collins]</a>: everybody who has to be inside of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7332.648s">[Collins]</a>: I think that's a really shared goal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7335.529s">[Collins]</a>: And I think this heartbreak is shared that our schools are not safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7340.151s">[Collins]</a>: They're not secure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7341.072s">[Collins]</a>: They don't feel supportive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7343.053s">[Collins]</a>: And, you know, in this conversation, you know, I want to hear from the people most affected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7347.355s">[Collins]</a>: That's the folks who go to the schools every day and the people who love them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7351.857s">[Collins]</a>: As we mentioned, you know, many counselors, myself included, have papers later on the agenda for ways that this council can act within its power to try and be part of the solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7361.372s">[Collins]</a>: We'll get into more of that later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7364.693s">[Collins]</a>: It's deeply troubling that we have to be having this conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7369.296s">[Collins]</a>: It's hard to put into words how to express sympathy for something so painful that's happened to kids just going to school and their families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7379.161s">[Collins]</a>: It's a sorry thing, the events that precipitated this discussion, but we have to have it and we're gonna have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7386.865s">[Collins]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli and others were calling for urgent action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7390.199s">[Collins]</a>: We're calling for the council to act within its purview to try and be part of the solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7393.841s">[Collins]</a>: And I completely agree, completely agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7398.283s">[Collins]</a>: You know, we have to use our powers as city councilors to try and be part of the solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7402.265s">[Collins]</a>: We aren't the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7404.286s">[Collins]</a>: We can't be the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7405.887s">[Collins]</a>: We can't make the type of the decisions that the school community is empowered to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7410.029s">[Collins]</a>: We can use the powers that we have as the city council to try to direct resources where they need to go to try to be a part of the community-wide conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7417.628s">[Collins]</a>: to emphasize the voices of the folks that are most affected by this, to listen to the people who know best where those resources need to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7424.231s">[Collins]</a>: And I'm glad that we get to be a part of that conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7426.992s">[Collins]</a>: I hope that going forward, this can be more collaborative, that we can all do our specific roles, but in concert with each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7435.715s">[Collins]</a>: And lastly, since Councilor Scarpelli's resolution calls for public input, if anybody's here to give input, I just want to acknowledge that not everybody does feel comfortable speaking in public, especially on live TV.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7445.68s">[Collins]</a>: It's not for the faint of heart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7447.356s">[Collins]</a>: And also not every comment, especially when kids and school security is involved, is best said in a public setting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7454.543s">[Collins]</a>: I just wanna restate for the record, whether we're in session or not, I'm available to any resident, to any constituent to field ideas, to hear your questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7465.213s">[Collins]</a>: If you just need a listening ear, if you don't feel comfortable speaking tonight, you can always reach out to me, we're available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7473.218s">[Collins]</a>: So I just wanted to say that at the outset of any community input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7477.341s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9175.618s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9176.518s">[Collins]</a>: And I'm speaking off the cuff here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9178.819s">[Collins]</a>: So I just want to say, you know, I think that what the community deserves today in the aftermath of yesterday's events, in the aftermath of other traumatic, tragic events, what the community deserves is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9194.111s">[Collins]</a>: a communicative, collaborative city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9199.876s">[Collins]</a>: They deserve clear communication, resolve to work together productively from all their elected leaders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9207.843s">[Collins]</a>: We owe our community better than infighting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9210.386s">[Collins]</a>: You know, we've disagreed on many things many times before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9214.389s">[Collins]</a>: Behind this rail, it'll happen again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9217.292s">[Collins]</a>: That's what we're here to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9219.332s">[Collins]</a>: We're here to represent different viewpoints for perspective on issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9222.973s">[Collins]</a>: We're here to represent different viewpoints for how to, how to craft strategy and how to respond to problems in our community and how to plan for the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9231.094s">[Collins]</a>: But I think that we owe today, especially today and all days, we owe the community a productive use of our time, discussing available strategies for what we can do within our powers to try to deal with the problems before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9246.478s">[Collins]</a>: I, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9248.973s">[Collins]</a>: What, what looks like a buzzword to one counselor might be somebody else's best good faith, earnest approach at doing something that is within our power, within our purview to try to address specifically a problem that exists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9265.717s">[Collins]</a>: It's put forth in good faith.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9267.018s">[Collins]</a>: And I think that tracks both ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9268.478s">[Collins]</a>: I don't think it's productive for us to launch into<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9274.321s">[Collins]</a>: veiled personal attacks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9275.682s">[Collins]</a>: You know, I don't want, I don't want that to be what tonight is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9279.184s">[Collins]</a>: I think that we have to come together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9280.846s">[Collins]</a>: We have to discuss the strategies that we've put forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9283.367s">[Collins]</a>: We might not agree on all of them, but what our community is calling out for is a good faith, earnest discussion of strategies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9290.372s">[Collins]</a>: It does our community no good to spill a lot of ink and spill a lot of airtime, fighting about things that we cannot control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9300.88s">[Collins]</a>: The community deserves better than a performance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9303.223s">[Collins]</a>: we need to discuss strategies that we have the capacity to enforce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9307.105s">[Collins]</a>: And sometimes we will disagree about what those best strategies are, but that's what our time should be for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9311.666s">[Collins]</a>: So I have a rationale for why I brought the strategies that I think are most important to talk about here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9317.669s">[Collins]</a>: I know those feelings aren't universally shared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9319.85s">[Collins]</a>: I'll save that for when those papers are brought up, but I really hope that we can maintain<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9325.708s">[Collins]</a>: clear communication and sticking to the issues at hand and striving for concrete strategies for as much of this evening as possible, because that's what the community needs from us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9333.399s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12246.495s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12247.856s">[Collins]</a>: Um, I it's, it's hard to add anything after a story like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12251.239s">[Collins]</a>: I don't have anything to add.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12252.12s">[Collins]</a>: I just wanted to thank you for, for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12254.021s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for sharing your story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12256.402s">[Collins]</a>: I'm not a parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12257.182s">[Collins]</a>: I can't fathom what it's like to be a parent and go through something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12260.183s">[Collins]</a>: Something that unfortunately a lot of families in our public school systems have to go through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12264.144s">[Collins]</a>: It's heartbreaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12264.885s">[Collins]</a>: I just want to say, you know, our hearts go out to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12266.725s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15180.457s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you very much, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15182.439s">[Collins]</a>: Tonight is the third night of the holiday Hanukkah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15185.321s">[Collins]</a>: I hope my colleagues will join me in wishing a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15187.734s">[Collins]</a>: Chag Sameach or happy holiday to all who celebrate this holiday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15191.936s">[Collins]</a>: Celebrates the legend of an oil candle that burned in probably for eight whole nights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15196.597s">[Collins]</a>: And I think tonight we can celebrate the miracle of a hypothetical candle that burned for a probably five hour city council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15202.499s">[Collins]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15431.086s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15432.407s">[Collins]</a>: Just to keep it very brief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15433.528s">[Collins]</a>: This is a project that I've already discussed with the director of PBS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15437.11s">[Collins]</a>: This came about because of my involvement in the Solid Waste Task Force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15440.072s">[Collins]</a>: They thought that an ordinance to this effect would help further the overall goals of the task force and further streamline<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15447.231s">[Collins]</a>: standards and operations for all waste haulers in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15450.292s">[Collins]</a>: They've already indicated that draft language is available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15453.853s">[Collins]</a>: So I'd move approval for referring this into subcommittee for further study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=11.0s">[Collins]</a>: Present<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3909.113s">[Collins]</a>: Sorry, I think Councilor Callahan had her hand up first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3912.974s">[Collins]</a>: Just a general comment, I really appreciate the communication so far as our budget season gets off to its start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3918.996s">[Collins]</a>: I know that it's been,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3920.808s">[Collins]</a>: busy start to this kind of forecasting, assessing, and planning season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3924.249s">[Collins]</a>: I appreciate the communication so far, and I think this presentation is really helpful as we head into and get further into the weeds together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3930.651s">[Collins]</a>: I haven't heard a lot of specific questions from me tonight because I think sort of the scope that we're looking at that President Bears just summed up are kind of the concerns and questions that are on all of our minds, which is, you know, as we, as the work gets on, it continues on your side to try to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3948.462s">[Collins]</a>: bring the two numbers in reconciliation with each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3952.364s">[Collins]</a>: You know, obviously the question that we are all, you know, continuing to discuss is reconciling what we have with our fixed non-negotiable costs, especially in our first budgeting year after ARPA, which, you know, this will be my first budget after ARPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3969.914s">[Collins]</a>: It feels like a seismic change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3971.675s">[Collins]</a>: And I know that, you know, essentially we have our rock solid non-negotiables<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3978.066s">[Collins]</a>: And I think for this council, we have other non-negotiables that are technically negotiable, but from the value that they bring to the community, you know, often come into this conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3987.411s">[Collins]</a>: We're having a budget conversation here that we know is fiscally really difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3993.194s">[Collins]</a>: I think that we're all, you know, all eagerly and with a little bit of anxiety anticipating, you know, when we get to that reconciliation phase, how many of those programs that are, you know, programming staff, you know, working together to make sure that we are,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4008.922s">[Collins]</a>: keeping as much in this budget during this very difficult year as we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4011.742s">[Collins]</a>: So I'm glad that we're doing that together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4013.723s">[Collins]</a>: I'm glad that we're starting early and I appreciate all of the early communication around what kind of scenario we find ourselves in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4020.984s">[Collins]</a>: And it is great to hear about all of the coordination efforts, which I know are not new, but get a little bit more finessed every year with trying to lump together those costs that occur in different places around the building, around the institution to make sure that we are not duplicating expenses where we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4035.647s">[Collins]</a>: Because in this type of budget year, I know that every little bit<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4039.053s">[Collins]</a>: does make a difference, especially when we are talking about some of those grant-funded positions that we're trying to keep within the operating budget, which might be, you know, under $100,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4047.599s">[Collins]</a>: Like, some of those cost-saving measures could really make the difference for positions like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4052.181s">[Collins]</a>: So all of that is really meaningful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4053.242s">[Collins]</a>: It's appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4054.142s">[Collins]</a>: And I know we'll probably have some tough decision points and discussions ahead of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4060.546s">[Collins]</a>: But, you know, the early information is very appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4063.088s">[Collins]</a>: Appreciate all the effort that you're putting into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4065.069s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5099.332s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5099.892s">[Collins]</a>: Just a quick clarifying question on the same topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5102.013s">[Collins]</a>: You said nine months on the RFPs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5103.593s">[Collins]</a>: Is that, do you expect to get proposals back from vendors or just what's the step in the timeline?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5153.912s">[Collins]</a>: Understood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5154.237s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5872.007s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, it doesn't have to be a motion, but will the slides from today's presentation be emailed around for the councillors who want it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5877.611s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5877.931s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5985.199s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5985.439s">[Collins]</a>: Just want to again thank Director Dickinson, Chief of Staff for being here tonight and for preparing us for this meeting, all the documents you've prepared for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5993.267s">[Collins]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5994.268s">[Collins]</a>: And thank you as well to the clerk for the budget presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5999.013s">[Collins]</a>: I don't think we need to thank ourselves for ours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=6001.876s">[Collins]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=6003.858s">[Collins]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=12.764s">[Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=257.875s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=258.995s">[Collins]</a>: I want to congratulate you again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=260.876s">[Collins]</a>: Rick, in my culture, we have a name for a person like you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=263.677s">[Collins]</a>: It's a mensch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=264.778s">[Collins]</a>: And, you know, this past week was, you know, we all talked about your service and making sure that this elderly tenant had a safe landing spot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=272.541s">[Collins]</a>: But I know that for you, this is just, you know, that was just a regular Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=276.183s">[Collins]</a>: And it's that kind of service that makes this honor so well earned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=278.624s">[Collins]</a>: So thank you for doing what you do all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=433.275s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears, for co-sponsoring this resolution with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=437.518s">[Collins]</a>: Jewish American History Month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=440.25s">[Collins]</a>: Heritage Month, excuse me, is a relatively new commemoration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=445.133s">[Collins]</a>: It was first proclaimed in 2006.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=446.894s">[Collins]</a>: It was a collaboration between the American federal government and Jewish museums throughout the nation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=453.158s">[Collins]</a>: And I think that this is a wonderful opportunity to thank Jewish culture bearers in Medford, not just for their contributions, but for continuing to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=460.623s">[Collins]</a>: tell the stories of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=462.406s">[Collins]</a>: And it's a good reminder to thank all culture bearers of all communities within Medford for continuing to tell their stories and share their culture and their history with the entire community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1041.62s">[Collins]</a>: We met again with the city council zoning consultant, and we reported out several items which are all on the city council agenda tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1049.345s">[Collins]</a>: The table of use and parking regulations, updating some definitions, updating just the digital version of the existing zoning map, and municipal exemptions, no substantive changes, just some tweaks to streamline the city's zoning procedures while we work with the zoning consultant on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1070.376s">[Collins]</a>: more thematic changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1071.636s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1173.752s">[Collins]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1180.334s">[Collins]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1181.794s">[Collins]</a>: President Bears?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1188.856s">[Collins]</a>: Motion to suspend the rules and take 24-366 out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1441.274s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1603.068s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1629.96s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1632.341s">[Collins]</a>: This council has for a long time been a forum for residents when they are in a time of need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1638.824s">[Collins]</a>: I think it's fitting that former Councilor Caraviello is here tonight because in my first term, you know, he was the liaison that bridge that made that connection with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1650.67s">[Collins]</a>: a whole group of tenants that were in a time of need and I think early 2022 with the Bradley Road tenants and made sure that counselors were informed of what was happening in their building and could offer whatever support we could as they sought their next safe haven in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1668.442s">[Collins]</a>: And I'm glad that this council can be a forum to hear from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1671.784s">[Collins]</a>: residents in any occasion of need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1675.025s">[Collins]</a>: Over the past several months, tenants at the Brooks Park apartments have been keeping councilors informed of their situation, which includes, you know, the property changing hands, and unfortunately, a wave of displacement and evictions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1689.949s">[Collins]</a>: I understand that they've been seeking to converse and discuss and negotiate with their property owners that they can remain in this community, and I am grateful to them for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1699.952s">[Collins]</a>: appearing tonight so that we can hear an update directly from the source about the status of their tenancies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1705.835s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3127.745s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3129.786s">[Collins]</a>: I want to thank again everybody who's spoken so far, everybody who's spoken as a member of the Tenants Association, and to the people who have come here to stand in solidarity with them, or the people who found themselves here and are supporting them nonetheless.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3143.509s">[Collins]</a>: I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3146.186s">[Collins]</a>: That seems like a really Medford thing to me to say, you're my neighbor and I want you to be able to stay here and I want you to stay a part of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3153.901s">[Collins]</a>: I wanted to keep it brief at the beginning to pass the mic to the folks who are really going through this, but I just want to give a little bit more context about how I came to know about this issue that these tenants are facing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3162.767s">[Collins]</a>: I think it's been almost a year since I heard about the sale of the Brooks Park Apartments for the first time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3169.392s">[Collins]</a>: It was actually somebody who lived, who owns a condo up the road who first reached out to me and said they had seen the for sale sign and they were really worried because they knew that this was naturally occurring affordable housing and they were worried about what would happen to the tenants after it was sold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3182.322s">[Collins]</a>: It was shortly after that that myself and President Bears, together with the planning department, started spending a few days just on the phone, all the time talking to an interested affordable housing developer and trying to see what we could do to make sure that this building would be competitive to sell to an affordable housing developer instead of to a for-profit housing developer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3204.26s">[Collins]</a>: And that didn't happen, unfortunately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3205.981s">[Collins]</a>: The offer just wasn't competitive with what the corporate property owner could offer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3211.566s">[Collins]</a>: And I remember thinking, it's going to happen again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3214.55s">[Collins]</a>: What happened on Bradley Road is just going to happen again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3216.852s">[Collins]</a>: And we're just waiting for it to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3219.596s">[Collins]</a>: You know, and then several months later, it happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3222.439s">[Collins]</a>: And we saw that wave of notice to quit notices go out to these two, we're hearing about that wave of evictions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3231.488s">[Collins]</a>: And you know that just it, it breaks my heart as a representative of neighbors in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3237.472s">[Collins]</a>: When people from up the street or people who are going through this come to me as a city councilor and say, what are you doing about this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3244.697s">[Collins]</a>: How can you stop this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3245.618s">[Collins]</a>: How can you how can you keep these people in our community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3248.16s">[Collins]</a>: How can you help me to stay in this community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3251.522s">[Collins]</a>: And it breaks my heart because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3254.07s">[Collins]</a>: There's not a lot we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3255.011s">[Collins]</a>: We had this conversation when Bradley Road was happening, we said we can stand with you, we can support you, and we can platform what you're going through, we can platform your testimony, we can stand with you when you rally outside the building, when you try and try and try to get your property owner just to talk with you, just to try and recognize you as a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3273.564s">[Collins]</a>: a group of residents that are trying to collectively bargain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3277.246s">[Collins]</a>: But the state doesn't give us any other tools for keeping our residents who want to stay here in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3285.009s">[Collins]</a>: We don't have those tools that other states have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3288.87s">[Collins]</a>: You know, I think that I'm so glad that we're talking about what it will take to put the city in a position where we can in the future buy a building like this and say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3301.28s">[Collins]</a>: We got this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3302.441s">[Collins]</a>: We'll protect you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3303.561s">[Collins]</a>: That building's up for sale.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3304.982s">[Collins]</a>: We're going to buy it so that Medford residents can stay there in perpetuity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3310.005s">[Collins]</a>: We're not at that place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3310.925s">[Collins]</a>: I think they're growing an affordable housing trust fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3314.407s">[Collins]</a>: The analogy that comes to mind is it's like planting a tree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3317.249s">[Collins]</a>: Right now we're planting that tree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3318.429s">[Collins]</a>: That sapling is in the ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3319.63s">[Collins]</a>: It's been in the ground for three months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3321.511s">[Collins]</a>: It's going to be decades before we can turn that into<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3327.591s">[Collins]</a>: purchasing buildings that will be affordable housing for members of this community, unless we start planting immediately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3333.817s">[Collins]</a>: And that's what's so sad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3334.738s">[Collins]</a>: We're behind the eight ball.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3336.459s">[Collins]</a>: So we need to be thinking about growing that forest so that this doesn't keep happening again in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3341.624s">[Collins]</a>: But in the short term, we need more tools to help people like the tenants that are before us this evening, whose problem is right here and right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3349.851s">[Collins]</a>: It can't wait 20 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3351.809s">[Collins]</a>: So I want to thank you so much for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3353.27s">[Collins]</a>: And every time that a tenant speaks out for themselves and their neighbors, they're speaking out for all tenants who don't want to be moved around the region like pawns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3359.795s">[Collins]</a>: They want to stay here in their community where they work and have friends and have family and have invested and want to keep investing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3367.481s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3949.133s">[Collins]</a>: President Bears?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3955.074s">[Collins]</a>: I just want to note that I think we've gotten pretty far off of the topic of the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3959.075s">[Collins]</a>: I would like to respond to the misinformative spin put on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3966.098s">[Collins]</a>: actions that I've made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3967.459s">[Collins]</a>: However, I'd prefer that we get back on topic and get on with the meeting because talking about the transfer fee was not on the agenda for tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3973.985s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5421.0s">[Collins]</a>: I'm gonna make a quick comment, and then I'm gonna make a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5425.021s">[Collins]</a>: Actually, I'll make the motion first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5426.021s">[Collins]</a>: The motion is to receive and place on file, I guess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5440.23s">[Collins]</a>: Yeah, that's a better idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5665.046s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5665.987s">[Collins]</a>: This is the first package small package of updates to come out of the planning and permitting committee and its work with the zoning consultant that the city council hired at the beginning of this term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5677.518s">[Collins]</a>: So we're starting it off with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5680.16s">[Collins]</a>: some proposals that I think will be, you know, relatively minor procedural compared to the scope of work that we will be continuing on for the rest of this term, which will be, you know, kind of encountering those bigger questions that constituents have been coming to us with for years around residential development and commercial development and mixed use development and incorporating the goals and themes of our comprehensive plan, climate plan, housing production plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5705.359s">[Collins]</a>: These are less sexy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5708.886s">[Collins]</a>: We've been working with the zoning consultant and planning staff and the new building commissioner to make<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5716.969s">[Collins]</a>: What's the word I'm looking for kind of some like formatting changes to the table of use and parking regulations, so that all of the relevant information is on the same page and updated so that it's more readable, so that when city staff and potential developers are looking for this information, they don't have to go flipping through our very low court ordinances to find it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5736.107s">[Collins]</a>: We have also added and made some adjustments to the definitions in the zoning code to bring that up to best practice and to include some definitions that we might need to include later when we do tweak the zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5747.833s">[Collins]</a>: We would like to adopt the new digital GIS zoning map.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5752.775s">[Collins]</a>: There's been no material changes to the zoning map proposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5755.717s">[Collins]</a>: We'd just like to move away from the literally colored pencil version and have the official version be the digital version instead, which I think is a great step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5764.601s">[Collins]</a>: And finally, the proposal also includes certain municipal exemptions from the zoning code ordinances so that major city projects, for example, a new fire headquarters will be able to proceed in a more efficient, streamlined manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5779.404s">[Collins]</a>: So procedurally, this has to be referred to the Community Development Board before this council can take a vote to codify it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5785.705s">[Collins]</a>: So I'd motion to send it to the CDB.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5800.909s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6253.496s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6844.0s">[Collins]</a>: I'll let George go and then I'll speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=38.838s">[Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=153.916s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=290.536s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=345.455s">[Collins]</a>: I would also like to extend my thanks and congratulations to all the organizers of this event and everybody who participated, signed up to host a band on their porch or contributed in other ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=354.096s">[Collins]</a>: You know, this is the type of thing that Medford residents have been wanting to see more of for a very long time, and it's great to see this event growing and flourishing more and more every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=362.658s">[Collins]</a>: So thank you and my congratulations to the organizers and to all of the musical acts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=755.904s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Burris.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=756.725s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=758.145s">[Collins]</a>: Just two quick questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=759.786s">[Collins]</a>: When is the work plan to be done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=761.968s">[Collins]</a>: And I noted the recommendations around sidewalk restoration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=765.61s">[Collins]</a>: I'm just curious how much of the sidewalk is going to be restored?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=768.912s">[Collins]</a>: Is it just the area immediately around the pole or is it more of the block?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=775.555s">[Collins]</a>: If you happen to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=781.755s">[Collins]</a>: What other areas were you... Or just how far up and down the sidewalk will the restoration be extending, or is it just gonna be the area immediately around the pole?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=794.424s">[Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=796.106s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=797.006s">[Collins]</a>: And when is the work planned for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1399.279s">[Collins]</a>: Motion to approve pending the public comment period with the conditions recommended by the city engineer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1558.373s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1560.473s">[Collins]</a>: This has come before City Council at a regular meeting once before when we procedurally had to refer it to the Community Development Board before it can come back to us for a formal vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1571.136s">[Collins]</a>: This is the first package of zoning change proposals to come out of the Planning and Permitting Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1577.457s">[Collins]</a>: That committee has been working all year so far with the City Council's new zoning consultant on a host of zoning-related goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1585.639s">[Collins]</a>: And this is that first set.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1586.78s">[Collins]</a>: These are namely<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1588.44s">[Collins]</a>: What I would characterize as formatting, streamlining, and procedural changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1592.983s">[Collins]</a>: We'll get to our discussions of more of those bigger themes and bigger changes later in the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1598.547s">[Collins]</a>: These are simpler.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1600.769s">[Collins]</a>: The first is to, as was stated, just to quickly restate that we all know what we're talking about, changing the format of the table of uses and parking regulations so that that table is more readable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1611.156s">[Collins]</a>: The intent of this is to put the parking and loading requirements into a format that is more<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1616.079s">[Collins]</a>: intuitive, easier to understand switching away from a code based model.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1620.041s">[Collins]</a>: And so that it's all on the same page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1621.341s">[Collins]</a>: So people who would like to do business in the city of Medford don't have to flip through our rather long code of ordinances to find what they're looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1629.225s">[Collins]</a>: The second is many definitions were amended or added into the definitional tables that these could be made useful later in the zoning process or to just update and modernize the definitions that we're currently using.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1642.37s">[Collins]</a>: All of these changes were rigorously considered with city staff as well as zoning consultants over the course of several meetings in April and May.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1650.856s">[Collins]</a>: We are also taking a vote to adopt the GIS digital version of our zoning map.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1655.819s">[Collins]</a>: There are no substantive changes being proposed to the zoning map.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1658.561s">[Collins]</a>: This is just to make it so the official on-the-book zoning map for the city of Medford is the one that is digital, is the one that has GIS letters, and is not the one that is quite literally paper and colored pencil.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1669.808s">[Collins]</a>: A good step for year 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1672.41s">[Collins]</a>: Finally, the last proposal in this package is to exempt certain municipal uses from the table of use in parking regulations and the table of dimensional requirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1682.633s">[Collins]</a>: This is to streamline the process for the building of certain city infrastructure so that those buildings, for example, hypothetically, a new fire infrastructure, wouldn't have to go through the cumbersome zoning ordinance, zoning, sorry, zoning variance regulations that it would otherwise potentially be subjected to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1701.018s">[Collins]</a>: I would motion to take the first vote to be ordained after a comment from my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1820.949s">[Collins]</a>: Need I make a motion to adopt the recommendation from the CDB in my motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1826.611s">[Collins]</a>: Motion to approve with the typographical suggestion from the CDB.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2008.822s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2009.482s">[Collins]</a>: I would motion to suspend the rules to take papers 24-415, 24-045, 24-410, 24-413, 24-414,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2024.016s">[Collins]</a>: out of order to join those papers for consideration and to suspend Rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2057.004s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3948.305s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3950.586s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3951.086s">[Collins]</a>: Nice to see you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3954.56s">[Collins]</a>: I want to thank you for the comprehensive proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3956.601s">[Collins]</a>: I also want to thank you for presenting each of these pieces in context of one another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3963.106s">[Collins]</a>: For me, that is the theme and the precondition for this budget season is all of these pieces have to work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3969.61s">[Collins]</a>: This is my third budget season that I've had as a councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3976.696s">[Collins]</a>: This is the least chaotic one so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3982.381s">[Collins]</a>: Let me put that another way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3984.103s">[Collins]</a>: We're facing some really big difficulties here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3987.126s">[Collins]</a>: The budget process has always been difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3990.749s">[Collins]</a>: It's been difficult while I've been on the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3992.131s">[Collins]</a>: I know it's been difficult before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3993.612s">[Collins]</a>: We're coming off of a really difficult period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3995.334s">[Collins]</a>: I've always made it clear what my red lines are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3997.856s">[Collins]</a>: This collaborative process has allowed us to reach a budget plan that I am<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4003.772s">[Collins]</a>: comfortable and happy to put forward tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4009.116s">[Collins]</a>: We have known for a while that Medford has a funding problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4013.839s">[Collins]</a>: This has been the topic of so many conversations between me and my colleagues in these chambers, outside of these chambers, the school funding problem and infrastructure funding problem, the capacity building problem, the problem of weaning off of one-time funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4027.729s">[Collins]</a>: These are not problems that are unique to Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4030.211s">[Collins]</a>: They're problems that we have to work through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4033.397s">[Collins]</a>: In the two and a half years that I have been on the council, we have discussed, I think, every mechanism that could contribute towards the solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4038.9s">[Collins]</a>: As a council, we've made zoning changes that could promote new growth, and we're working on more in our continuing zoning work that we'll put to votes later in the term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4048.484s">[Collins]</a>: We've discussed the city's ARPA strategy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4051.025s">[Collins]</a>: President Bears and I even proposed an override back in 2022, though it did not move forward, and that was robustly discussed in the previous term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4059.509s">[Collins]</a>: This year, everybody is well aware that countdown clock on our strategy for the future is hitting zero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4065.693s">[Collins]</a>: ARPA and ESSER are going offline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4067.034s">[Collins]</a>: So since last fall, the financial task force, which was convened last year as a condition of the FY24 budget, has been meeting to talk about what's next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4077.301s">[Collins]</a>: I've been really proud to be a part of that process, which I joined when I joined city council leadership at the beginning of this term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4084.927s">[Collins]</a>: And I think that that has been part of that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4088.373s">[Collins]</a>: that really important critical pivot towards greater collaboration, which has also been affirmed by you and your staff's participation in the budget ordinance process, as well as this collaboration on meeting the needs of this budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4102.498s">[Collins]</a>: This is the culmination of many meetings over many months discussing precisely what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4107.199s">[Collins]</a>: our needs are and how to meet them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4109.001s">[Collins]</a>: We have rigorously considered the needs facing Medford public schools and city infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4118.271s">[Collins]</a>: Among these branches of government, we certainly don't always agree, but the bottom line is that there's a set of facts and a set of goals that we are completely aligned on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4130.199s">[Collins]</a>: then I also believe that the community fundamentally is aligned on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4134.143s">[Collins]</a>: We need to maintain at least level service at MPS, we need to staff it properly, and we need to enable public education to start getting better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4141.57s">[Collins]</a>: We need our roads and sidewalks to start getting better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4143.511s">[Collins]</a>: We need to be in a position<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4145.453s">[Collins]</a>: to pay our city and school staff competitively, and unless we take action, those things will not happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4151.398s">[Collins]</a>: Our schools will not be what we want them to be, what we need them to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4155.442s">[Collins]</a>: We will lose students to private schools, and those who cannot afford that type of expense will suffer the most.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4161.127s">[Collins]</a>: Our infrastructure will depreciate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4163.269s">[Collins]</a>: Those costs will get passed along to individuals at even higher rates, and we will lose good city workers to other municipalities or the private sectors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4172.551s">[Collins]</a>: There's always been a lot to discuss in how we solve these problems, but I truly believe that, for the most part, we are aligned on these facts and these goals, because we all know that those outcomes are unacceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4186.936s">[Collins]</a>: And I think a hallmark of this proposal on how to pivot towards the future hinges on a combined approach of coming out of the reason that we're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4202.557s">[Collins]</a>: Sorry, can you tell I'm nervous?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4203.638s">[Collins]</a>: This is only the biggest vote that we take all year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4206.179s">[Collins]</a>: Pardon me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4207.199s">[Collins]</a>: Just breaking the fourth wall here for a sec.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4214.383s">[Collins]</a>: You know, we only had ARPA and ESSER to wean off of in the first place because we're coming off of such a hard time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4220.846s">[Collins]</a>: And now we're adapting to that new normal, figuring out what it will require of us, and taking the affirmative steps to gain the revenue that we need to keep Medford a place that supports the people that live here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4237.662s">[Collins]</a>: So for me, this budget is conditioned on its context.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4240.384s">[Collins]</a>: We are considering it in the context of two override proposals, one from President Bears and I, one from you, Mayor, totaling $7.5 million, which if they pass, will start stabilizing our school and city operating budgets in quarter three of this fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4254.256s">[Collins]</a>: We're considering that in the context of a $1.75 million appropriation to stabilize the school department in quarters one and two of this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4263.064s">[Collins]</a>: And to me, that's critical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4264.705s">[Collins]</a>: That is what my sense of confidence in this plan is hinged on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4268.628s">[Collins]</a>: That gives us the breathing room to get to the override vote, which we put to residents in November without devastating effects happening to the school's department in the meantime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4280.176s">[Collins]</a>: And then the overrides should they pass will allow us to start investing in things getting better and bringing up that baseline year over year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4287.702s">[Collins]</a>: I know that a lot of people are frustrated that we have to be here at all contemplating overrides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4293.174s">[Collins]</a>: I think that totally makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4295.218s">[Collins]</a>: I really do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4296.4s">[Collins]</a>: I also wish that we were, I wish that this was something that no municipality had to contemplate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4304.549s">[Collins]</a>: But I think it's important context to note that since 1990, 300 of the 351 cities and towns in Massachusetts have advanced at least one override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4313.574s">[Collins]</a>: And many of them have done them lots of times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4316.395s">[Collins]</a>: There have been over 4,500 individual overrides on ballots in municipalities since 1990.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4322.218s">[Collins]</a>: For debt exclusions, that number is even higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4325.299s">[Collins]</a>: There's been 313 cities and towns that have advanced debt exclusions since 1989.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4331.982s">[Collins]</a>: totaling over 4,000 individual debt exclusions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4335.784s">[Collins]</a>: So I just put that out there to say, it is really serious to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4339.305s">[Collins]</a>: It is really serious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4341.426s">[Collins]</a>: And that's why I'm glad that this is a mechanism that goes on the ballot so that residents of Medford will choose by popular vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4348.949s">[Collins]</a>: It is serious, but it is not an aberration to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4352.61s">[Collins]</a>: I think that the fact that Medford is one of those few municipalities that has never done this is part of the reason that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4360.613s">[Collins]</a>: Our budget seasons have been so hard lately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4365.196s">[Collins]</a>: And I'm proud that we're advancing proposals to start pivoting towards a more sustainable future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4369.959s">[Collins]</a>: So I will close by saying I am happy that this year we get to vote on not just a budget, but a plan to advance Medford out of underfunding and into a future where we can reliably provide better services for all students and all residents in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4389.11s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7496.309s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7497.53s">[Collins]</a>: I went pretty long earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7498.53s">[Collins]</a>: I'll try to keep this short, bring my average down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7503.194s">[Collins]</a>: First thing, about the financial task force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7506.657s">[Collins]</a>: And I think that there's some people who don't need to hear this, but when we talk about the press release that was released on Friday, that we all collaborated on, city council leadership, mayor and the mayor staff, school committee leadership,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7518.243s">[Collins]</a>: What that press release contained was the budget that was already made public, line by line, department by department, that the city council had already reviewed in budget hearings that the entire community was privy to if they cared to read those agendas or attend the meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7532.731s">[Collins]</a>: those same numbers, very minor, essentially all the numbers that we already had plus one and three quarters million dollars from ARPA to the schools proposed and the two overrides and debt exclusion that everybody gets to vote on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7548.241s">[Collins]</a>: So just to clarify what was presented on Friday<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7553.638s">[Collins]</a>: and how transparent or untransparent it was, was all the numbers that the city council and the school and the public already had, plus an appropriation of one-time funds, which many people, including myself, were hoping to see and working to secure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7567.564s">[Collins]</a>: And then three things that we get to put to the voters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7570.325s">[Collins]</a>: So I just want to set the record straight on that, because I think there's a lot of editorializing going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7576.768s">[Collins]</a>: Second, we have discussed free cash a lot on this council, last term, this term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7585.415s">[Collins]</a>: I have had, you know, it's no secret that we disagree on a lot of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7589.218s">[Collins]</a>: We agree on a lot of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7590.139s">[Collins]</a>: I've had some pretty sincere concerns about our free cash strategy in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7595.383s">[Collins]</a>: I have my own wishlist for how I'd like to see some of that money appropriated, which I know is different than the strategy that the mayor has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7601.868s">[Collins]</a>: To me,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7604.91s">[Collins]</a>: That is irrelevant here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7606.373s">[Collins]</a>: I do not see the end game in appropriating large sums of our free cash reserves towards operating costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7614.507s">[Collins]</a>: What is the end game of that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7615.749s">[Collins]</a>: We end up back here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7618.294s">[Collins]</a>: we can wish upon a star that we're going to see new growth accelerate at such an incredible rate that we are going to be able to fill that gap exactly in 12 months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7628.377s">[Collins]</a>: But I don't think that we should be budgeting on wishful thinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7631.058s">[Collins]</a>: Again, I've had sincere concerns and grievances about how we're using free cash in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7637.44s">[Collins]</a>: I have my own preferences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7639.781s">[Collins]</a>: It is not the path forward that I think the community wants and needs to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7646.73s">[Collins]</a>: allocate money towards the problem that we may never ever see again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7650.595s">[Collins]</a>: It pushes the can down the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7655.2s">[Collins]</a>: I also think that finding these proposals divisive is completely a choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7659.164s">[Collins]</a>: That's one of the wonderful things about this being a ballot question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7663.169s">[Collins]</a>: I think, you know, we're a room full of people who have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7667.367s">[Collins]</a>: voted differently on things in the past, we will again in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7671.768s">[Collins]</a>: And that doesn't have to make us any less of a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7674.089s">[Collins]</a>: We can talk about it and discuss it and debate about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7676.27s">[Collins]</a>: And some people will campaign one way and some people will campaign another way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7679.991s">[Collins]</a>: And it does not have to divide us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7682.892s">[Collins]</a>: That is a choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7689.954s">[Collins]</a>: And I think when people are telling you that you're being divided,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7694.5s">[Collins]</a>: You should pay attention to what the motives behind that imperative might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7697.781s">[Collins]</a>: You don't have to be divided by this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7699.562s">[Collins]</a>: This can actually bring us together in a city with a future that is going to be brighter and more supportive because of what we might do with these investments if we pass them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7708.812s">[Collins]</a>: Not willing to pass a budget based on wishful thinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7711.473s">[Collins]</a>: We can wish that new growth was different in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7714.154s">[Collins]</a>: We can wish for dramatic new growth over the next 12 months that'll solve all of our problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7718.955s">[Collins]</a>: That wouldn't be responsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7722.016s">[Collins]</a>: I don't think that what we want as duly elected leaders of the community is for the ability to point the finger and blame somebody else for our problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7730.059s">[Collins]</a>: I think we're all here to solve problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7733.02s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11758.258s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11763.171s">[Collins]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14105.796s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14107.056s">[Collins]</a>: I'm really glad that we've had the opportunity to consider all of these papers together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14111.437s">[Collins]</a>: Like I said earlier, I don't think there's any other way to consider all of these pieces than in context with each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14117.478s">[Collins]</a>: And I'm really glad that we got to hear from so many members of the community about each of these and about these budget-related proposals together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14128.92s">[Collins]</a>: With that, I'm gonna motion that we divide the question and consider each item in this order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14134.121s">[Collins]</a>: 24-413, which is the debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14136.002s">[Collins]</a>: 24-414, which is the mayor's $3.5 million override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14138.923s">[Collins]</a>: 24-415, which is President Bears and mine $4 million override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14140.364s">[Collins]</a>: 24-410, which is the ARPA allocation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14141.585s">[Collins]</a>: And then 24-045, which is the budget proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14142.585s">[Collins]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14230.675s">[Collins]</a>: I reviewed the corrections that were sent over from the mayor's office, and I just want to note.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14234.298s">[Collins]</a>: I got a lot of pages in this packet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14244.386s">[Collins]</a>: Just to clarify, is the correction being made that in the mayor's override proposal, which<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14251.267s">[Collins]</a>: 4-414, the first instance that for FY25 appears, that's being deleted?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14259.955s">[Collins]</a>: In the question, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14266.662s">[Collins]</a>: Just because that appears twice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14269.665s">[Collins]</a>: For both, okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14273.206s">[Collins]</a>: and I'd be happy to make that motion to adopt the corrections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14347.265s">[Collins]</a>: I'm sorry, was that amendment to do a similar deletion in 24-415?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14391.758s">[Collins]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14444.534s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14497.597s">[Collins]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14498.178s">[Collins]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14609.699s">[Collins]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14701.731s">[Collins]</a>: Sure, the rules are suspended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14704.434s">[Collins]</a>: They're suspended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14953.272s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14954.873s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14957.075s">[Collins]</a>: Any additional comments from Councilors on this motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14960.196s">[Collins]</a>: Councilor Callahan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15072.086s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15077.489s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15080.916s">[Collins]</a>: We'll now move to the public perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15082.538s">[Collins]</a>: Oh, President Burris.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15181.974s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15182.895s">[Collins]</a>: We'll go now to Councilor Scarpelli on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15309.585s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15323.677s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15323.977s">[Collins]</a>: And again, just to reaffirm that the city council is not the decision maker on the use of this parcel that is with the CDB and the DBA during the week of the 24th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15337.741s">[Collins]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15427.93s">[Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15821.157s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for your nuanced perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15823.078s">[Collins]</a>: Really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15823.899s">[Collins]</a>: I'm going to go to Zoom next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15827.141s">[Collins]</a>: Danielle, on Zoom, you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15911.302s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15912.543s">[Collins]</a>: We'll go to the podium now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15913.343s">[Collins]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16087.884s">[Collins]</a>: We'll go now to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16090.385s">[Collins]</a>: Mariana, I'll ask you to unmute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16091.665s">[Collins]</a>: Please state your name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16179.909s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16181.411s">[Collins]</a>: We'll go now to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16183.322s">[Collins]</a>: Bill on Zoom, I'll ask you to unmute, name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16297.274s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16298.635s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16299.787s">[Collins]</a>: We'll go next to Mr. Castagnetti.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16421.203s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro, and then we'll take our vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16461.907s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16463.027s">[Collins]</a>: Appreciate that clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16464.708s">[Collins]</a>: Before we go to our final hand on Zoom, I just want to segue from that to recenter that again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16471.473s">[Collins]</a>: The city council will not be taking a vote on where this use ought to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16475.415s">[Collins]</a>: We do not have the authority to take a vote on that matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16477.836s">[Collins]</a>: The resolution before us tonight is not a referendum on the efficacy of methadone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16484.939s">[Collins]</a>: We know that it is a medication that is used to treat a disease.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16488.741s">[Collins]</a>: Substance use disorder is like every disease, not something that anybody chooses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16494.103s">[Collins]</a>: And all patients should be treated with dignity and given every ability to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16500.612s">[Collins]</a>: receive care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16501.212s">[Collins]</a>: And I thank the counselor for recentering us on the intent of her resolution, which is to affirm that throughout the community of Medford, which is of course, and unfortunately, yet another community that has been ravaged by the opioid epidemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16516.962s">[Collins]</a>: And I'm glad to see us having discussions about how to best address that within our community for community members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16523.687s">[Collins]</a>: I'll go to Tony on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16526.148s">[Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16593.835s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16596.036s">[Collins]</a>: Any further comment from councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16597.977s">[Collins]</a>: Is there a motion on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16600.318s">[Collins]</a>: Motion to receive and place on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16603.66s">[Collins]</a>: Motion to receive and place on file, offered by Councilor Lazzaro, seconded by President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16610.003s">[Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16653.353s">[Collins]</a>: Whatever it was, I'll let you say it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16674.811s">[Collins]</a>: We're taking it from the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16675.792s">[Collins]</a>: How's it going?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16702.793s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears, and thank you for co-sponsoring this resolution with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16706.176s">[Collins]</a>: I'm very happy to recognize and celebrate Caribbean American Heritage Month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16713.142s">[Collins]</a>: We have many community members that are part of this vibrant community here in Medford, and it's great to have an opportunity to acknowledge these folks who hail from the Caribbean and have landed in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16725.954s">[Collins]</a>: sometimes for a short time, sometimes for many generations, and to celebrate the ways that their culture and their contributions add so much to our community here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16734.476s">[Collins]</a>: So a happy Caribbean American Heritage Month to us all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=596.63s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=598.231s">[Collins]</a>: I think it's one thing to take a stroll through the Brooks Park, you know, by oneself or with friends or with family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=605.054s">[Collins]</a>: It's another to get a personal tour from Mr. Lincoln, which I was very lucky to do when I first took office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=611.177s">[Collins]</a>: And it really is incredible hearing that kind of layers deep history of all of the work<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=618.201s">[Collins]</a>: volunteer work, community work, just layers of investment that go into making this really such a jewel in the community, the outdoor space, the historic preservation that the community gets to enjoy more and more every year as the renovation continues to go on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=632.954s">[Collins]</a>: So my heartfelt thanks to Mr. Lincoln, you know, really an incredible, an incredible legacy to leave in Medford, to leave the Brooks Park estate so improved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=644.364s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1017.381s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1019.682s">[Collins]</a>: Sylvia, thank you so much for so many years of service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1023.164s">[Collins]</a>: Congratulations on your retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1025.845s">[Collins]</a>: It is really hard to imagine the clerk's office without you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1029.786s">[Collins]</a>: And I think about the moments in my life in Medford that you have been there for when I filed for a business permit, when I pulled papers for the first time, when I took my first oath of office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1039.931s">[Collins]</a>: And I know there's so many people doing things that really contribute to the fabric of Medford, whether it's business permits or virtual licenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1048.055s">[Collins]</a>: you know, applying for various things in the city of Medford, they have to go through you and your colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1053.678s">[Collins]</a>: And you've been such an integral part of what that experience is like, of people trying to shape their life in various ways, shape their contributions to Medford in various ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1063.885s">[Collins]</a>: And what an incredible role to inhabit for so many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1067.367s">[Collins]</a>: So my thanks go out to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1069.028s">[Collins]</a>: I think 32 years of public service really tells you a lot about a person and how they choose to live their life in service to their community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1076.474s">[Collins]</a>: I wish you only the very best for a very long and happy retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1079.917s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1309.82s">[Collins]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1320.661s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1366.161s">[Collins]</a>: It's a happy day to get to congratulate two, you know, two civil servants with such incredible longevity and a history of so many years of contribution to our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1375.043s">[Collins]</a>: To be able to congratulate two on retirement in just one evening is really a happy thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1379.545s">[Collins]</a>: It's also a little bittersweet to say goodbye to two members, you know, two contributors to City Hall who have been so present for so many years, been of service to this council and to the community, you know, in ways personal and professional for such a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1397.25s">[Collins]</a>: Janice, congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1398.47s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for your many years of hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1401.392s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for, you know, bringing not only your hard work, but your personality to this city hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1406.895s">[Collins]</a>: We're sad to see you go, but again, best wishes for a joyful and long retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1412.158s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1666.04s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2221.954s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Beres.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2222.674s">[Collins]</a>: We want to thank you, Councilor Scarpelli, for putting this forward tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2226.755s">[Collins]</a>: Of course, it's always a sad occasion when somebody with such a huge impact, you know, yet another public servant, when we have to mark their passing here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2237.377s">[Collins]</a>: You know, and sad as it is, I'm glad for the opportunity to reflect on, you know, a person, a woman with a career that, who really ran right at challenge and the ability to do an outsized amount of good in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2250.046s">[Collins]</a>: So I spend my deepest condolences to her family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2352.196s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2354.337s">[Collins]</a>: On June 12th, the topic of the planning and permitting committee, which was the same one as which wrapped up right before this regular meeting, we were meeting with our zoning consultant, Innis Associates, which frequent flyers have heard me give this context before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2368.046s">[Collins]</a>: This is the zoning consultant that the city council hired at the end of last term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2372.309s">[Collins]</a>: And in many meetings of the planning and permitting committee this term, we have been working with them to create a work plan<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2378.433s">[Collins]</a>: pulling from the comprehensive plan, the climate action adaptation plan, the housing production plan to consider proposed changes to the zoning ordinance to make manifest in our zoning the goals and topics that the community has placed into those plans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2394.301s">[Collins]</a>: The topic of the June 12th meeting was to review the status of the mapping analysis and the topic-based work plan that will inform our future committee's work and votes over the summer and into the fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2408.595s">[Collins]</a>: motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2605.299s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2605.579s">[Collins]</a>: I have a motion to suspend the rules to take the following papers out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2608.52s">[Collins]</a>: 24-426, 24-418, 24-423, 24-424, and 24-436.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3806.614s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3807.914s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for putting this forward, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3809.595s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for the context, Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3811.956s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you to so many people for joining us in the council chambers, as always.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3818.473s">[Collins]</a>: I wouldn't wanna put words in Councilor Scarpelli's mouth, but when we're on the topic about how to proceed here procedurally, in the committee meeting directly before this one, in the planning and permitting committee, we were actually just discussing the issue of Salem Street Corridor as one of our zoning priorities as we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3836.081s">[Collins]</a>: So I think that this could be just a really cohesive move to refer this paper, which as we've been discussing needs a little bit more<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3844.687s">[Collins]</a>: that it needs tweaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3845.548s">[Collins]</a>: This is a zoning issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3847.769s">[Collins]</a>: We've never done a zoning issue in one meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3849.91s">[Collins]</a>: I think that that aligns very closely with the work that we were just discussing doing in the zoning committee, knowing that the rezoning of re-evaluating the zoning of Salem Street is already a priority for the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3862.158s">[Collins]</a>: We were just speaking about that in the last committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3864.58s">[Collins]</a>: And so I think it could be, I think it could dovetail really nicely with our existing plans to take a look at Salem Street Corridor in addition to some other priority corridors in the city and say, what does our zoning allow us to do here by right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3877.964s">[Collins]</a>: What does it allow us to do by a special permit, which until this permit was withdrawn, applied to this permit, what do we wanna see on these corridors and how should we update our zoning so that we get what we want and we don't have to worry about what we don't want<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3891.488s">[Collins]</a>: here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3891.728s">[Collins]</a>: And I do want to note, I've been hearing this, you know, over and over for the past couple weeks, and I'm really heartened to hear it from so many people in the community saying, it's not that I think we shouldn't have this in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3903.97s">[Collins]</a>: It's just that the location has to be right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3905.65s">[Collins]</a>: And I think that something I'm really certain we all share is that, you know, we know that this is something that people need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3912.112s">[Collins]</a>: This is a service that people need, that people in Medford need, that our neighbors need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3916.172s">[Collins]</a>: We want it to be successful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3917.533s">[Collins]</a>: And in order to be successful, it needs to be in the right location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3920.553s">[Collins]</a>: And I think that we can, I would love to prioritize this issue within our existing zoning work to make sure that as we're reevaluating our zoning already in progress, we're taking a look to say, where's the right spot for this use and how can we make sure that it can occur here and not in locations where it's going to be less successful and less supported by residents for understandable reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3943.758s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6005.828s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6006.668s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being here to present the appointees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6010.751s">[Collins]</a>: It's so exciting to be at the point of finally appointing trustees to the Affordable Housing Trust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6017.035s">[Collins]</a>: This project has been in the works for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6019.116s">[Collins]</a>: This was first proposed by former Council President John Falco, I believe, and it was voted on in the Council's previous term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6025.58s">[Collins]</a>: So I'm so glad to reach this point where we are putting some people power to this mechanism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6031.043s">[Collins]</a>: And I,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6033.144s">[Collins]</a>: really enjoyed reading over this paper over the weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6035.725s">[Collins]</a>: You know, this is a crew with such an incredible list of housing and affordable housing bona fides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6041.409s">[Collins]</a>: It makes me really proud to know that there are so many people like this in our community, and not just with these skills and experiences, but also willing to throw their hat in the ring and say, yes, I'll step up, I'll work hard to take on this really quite technical, detailed, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6061.212s">[Collins]</a>: issue of affordable housing and doing it right in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6066.304s">[Collins]</a>: It's not something you to show up and volunteer for an hour and then go on your way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6069.545s">[Collins]</a>: This requires volunteering, like real, real skill and thoughtfulness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6074.447s">[Collins]</a>: So I'm really happy to see all these appointees coming in with kind of an incredible level of professional experience to lend to this trust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6082.75s">[Collins]</a>: This is a really wonderful cohort to start off our Affordable Housing Trust with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6088.132s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for assembling these candidates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6089.792s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you all for applying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6090.673s">[Collins]</a>: And I will be so proud to vote in favor of all of these tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6106.057s">[Collins]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6340.553s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6341.413s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6342.414s">[Collins]</a>: Again, it's great to see a candidate that comes to our community with a unique perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6351.203s">[Collins]</a>: And I think that will bring a unique perspective to how to leverage our CPA funds to the greatest use for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6358.731s">[Collins]</a>: So pending further comment by my fellow counselors, I would motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9660.78s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Beas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9661.941s">[Collins]</a>: I want to thank everybody who spoke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9669.366s">[Collins]</a>: I think that this is, you know, with any issue that we don't have consensus on, you know, lately, it seems like it's pretty easy for things to get polarized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9683.717s">[Collins]</a>: When I listen to almost, not everybody, but almost everybody who's spoken on this issue at this meeting or who's emailed or called me or spoke at our last meeting, when I listen to almost all of those comments without any exception, I really do think that we all want the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9699.997s">[Collins]</a>: I've heard<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9701.735s">[Collins]</a>: Very, very few number of people say, I actually don't want this anywhere in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9705.336s">[Collins]</a>: I think this has no place in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9706.916s">[Collins]</a>: I've heard a very few number of people say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9709.577s">[Collins]</a>: I personally don't believe that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9710.998s">[Collins]</a>: I think this has a place in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9712.778s">[Collins]</a>: That doesn't mean it should go any place in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9715.699s">[Collins]</a>: I agree with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9716.679s">[Collins]</a>: The success of the mission depends on where we put it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9719.54s">[Collins]</a>: And I think everybody who's come forward and said, I'm really concerned about where this was proposed to go, that's totally reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9728.143s">[Collins]</a>: If anybody's felt vilified for having that opinion, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9732.526s">[Collins]</a>: I would never want anybody to feel that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9735.208s">[Collins]</a>: I don't think that you should be made to feel bad for voicing your opinion about where this should go or where it's going to be most successful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9742.132s">[Collins]</a>: I know some people are motivated by their neighborhood concerns and other people are motivated by, I don't think this is gonna be most successful here, this doesn't make sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9750.018s">[Collins]</a>: If this should go in a commercial or industrial area, why don't we have the tools currently in place to put it there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9757.136s">[Collins]</a>: That's actually under the jurisdiction of this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9759.617s">[Collins]</a>: That's what we have the power to do we've been working for a very long time, more terms that I've been on the council to get to a point where we have the resources to make those changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9767.899s">[Collins]</a>: When it comes to medical offices when it comes to many other uses so we can start finally start making decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9773.641s">[Collins]</a>: That could be answers to the question of why don't we have X here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9777.584s">[Collins]</a>: Why don't we have Y here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9779.346s">[Collins]</a>: Why doesn't Medford look more like XYZ the way I want it to, the way it used to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9783.629s">[Collins]</a>: We're finally amassing the resources to make those changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9788.693s">[Collins]</a>: They're not fast to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9790.214s">[Collins]</a>: We can't make them quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9791.915s">[Collins]</a>: It's too technical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9792.756s">[Collins]</a>: It's too detailed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9793.597s">[Collins]</a>: That's a very unglamorous, but I think well-known thing about government is if you do it fast, you might do it wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9799.061s">[Collins]</a>: And this is too important to not get right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9804.551s">[Collins]</a>: But I just want to reinforce that when I hear people talk about this, I really think that we all, with some very, very few exceptions, we know that this has a place in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9813.253s">[Collins]</a>: We know that we want to take excellent care of the people whose lives will be better off for having this available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9819.955s">[Collins]</a>: We know that there are people in Medford who do need this available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9823.476s">[Collins]</a>: We know that we should find the best possible place for this to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9826.857s">[Collins]</a>: I don't think that this shared cause is advanced by<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9832.439s">[Collins]</a>: using this forum to spread disinformation, such as there being a backroom deal to bring this into or to target a residential neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9840.325s">[Collins]</a>: Of course that didn't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9842.026s">[Collins]</a>: That would never happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9844.188s">[Collins]</a>: That's nobody's goals here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9845.309s">[Collins]</a>: I don't think this conversation is advanced by being resolute to be at war over this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9852.074s">[Collins]</a>: We're all on the same team here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9853.916s">[Collins]</a>: If we want to be at war about this, if people in this room or people in this conversation are resolved to be at war about this,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9860.595s">[Collins]</a>: we can drag this congregation down into the mud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9863.339s">[Collins]</a>: That's optional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9864.5s">[Collins]</a>: And I think that's completely, completely orthogonal to everybody's goals here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=10009.484s">[Collins]</a>: I thank the administration for their diligence in reviewing applications and I motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=10781.745s">[Collins]</a>: Motion to approve pending the comment period and conditioned on the final approvals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=10838.646s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bearer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=10839.467s">[Collins]</a>: Sorry, I got distracted because that was very sweet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=10842.93s">[Collins]</a>: I would motion to suspend the rules to take communications from the mayor and to suspend rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11144.283s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Burris.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11145.343s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being here and sticking with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11148.164s">[Collins]</a>: I don't have any specific questions on the appropriation requested, but I do always appreciate an overview of where CPA funding comes from, the very strict rules regulating what it may be spent on and in what proportion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11161.59s">[Collins]</a>: I'm glad to see that the CPC voted to increase voluntarily the amount that we're spending on community housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11166.992s">[Collins]</a>: I think that that's a value that's shared by many in the community, and I'm sure that'll be welcome news to many.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11171.457s">[Collins]</a>: So of course, all of the uses that CPA money can be spent on are, you know, we can look all around and see the benefit that they do throughout Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11179.706s">[Collins]</a>: So thank you so much for walking us through this, but I'm excited to approve this tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11505.052s">[Collins]</a>: I would motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12600.569s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12602.771s">[Collins]</a>: I know this project has been a long time in the works, and I appreciate your overview and presentation about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12610.839s">[Collins]</a>: I have a general understanding about what historic designation, what implication that has and doesn't have for how those properties might be affected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12620.952s">[Collins]</a>: You've spoken a little bit about how it's not an absolute prohibition on any particular material.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12625.509s">[Collins]</a>: working with developers so that I know renovations still happen under historic designation, EDUs can still happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12632.134s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12634.016s">[Collins]</a>: Because so much of, well, speaking for myself as one councilor, because a large part of the council's goals this term are to consider proposals that do allow us to look at tools that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12648.621s">[Collins]</a>: enable different neighborhoods to evolve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12651.043s">[Collins]</a>: I am, I have a healthy skepticism around tools that might make it more difficult for developers to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12661.491s">[Collins]</a>: do things like, I understand there's no prohibition on adding height, on affecting footprint, but I have some concerns around adding rules that will make it less likely for developers to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12674.458s">[Collins]</a>: Have you noticed in historic districts already in place in Medford, is there indeed a lag with developers or owners taking advantage of things that are still technically available to them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12771.104s">[Collins]</a>: It's hard to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12811.001s">[Collins]</a>: Appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13067.014s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Burris.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13072.105s">[Collins]</a>: Sorry, it's getting late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13073.108s">[Collins]</a>: Brain's slowing down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13076.042s">[Collins]</a>: Really appreciate this discussion really appreciate this kind of formal introduction to the issue though of course we've heard glimmers of it before when this was still in process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13085.668s">[Collins]</a>: I think that, at least for me as one counselor I think this is a topic that you know of course there's already historic designation along South Street already, but this does mark a significant expansion in that footprint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13097.854s">[Collins]</a>: And I think, you know, to echo some of what Councilor Scarpelli just said, I think that it seems very clear to me that for every concern or question we have, there's a ready answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13108.685s">[Collins]</a>: That being, notwithstanding that being the case, you know, it's pretty rare for us to take a first vote on an ordinance when it's first introduced before the Council, and I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13119.332s">[Collins]</a>: know, in the role that we inhabit on the City Council, especially with something as longstanding as an ordinance, we can feel incredible about how a current Board of Commissioners takes up their mission and implements it, and certainly I feel great about the work that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13135.763s">[Collins]</a>: you all do and how you've been doing and how you've been collaborating with community members and developers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13139.727s">[Collins]</a>: But this is something that marks a big enough change that I'd like to give it a bit more conversation and deliberation before we take votes on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13146.473s">[Collins]</a>: So I would make the motion to perhaps refer into the planning and permitting committee where we take up other building related topics for more of a discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13158.824s">[Collins]</a>: to go over the details of the questions raised by councillors before we move forward, unless there's an alternative proposal raised by my fellow councillors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13488.762s">[Collins]</a>: If I'm being totally candid,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13497.565s">[Collins]</a>: If I'm being candid, part of the reason for my desire to have more of this discussion in a separate meeting is because we have five or six major financial papers to take up after this, and I don't want to have that conversation right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13507.29s">[Collins]</a>: That said, if there's another motion to approve it outright, we just take the votes, and I wouldn't take that personally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15657.162s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15658.843s">[Collins]</a>: I think it's always helpful to have kind of a refresher on what free cash is and where it comes from, and the instability of that as a revenue source.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15675.371s">[Collins]</a>: I was thinking about it today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15676.351s">[Collins]</a>: I was thinking about different ways to articulate it, and I think this is probably an imperfect way of conceptualizing it, but I was thinking of free cash as money that we did not intend to save, and that's partly true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15686.836s">[Collins]</a>: But in part, our free cash is amassed because of positions that we intended to fill and pay people salaries for that because of various reasons, we didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15697.023s">[Collins]</a>: And I think the responsible thing to do with public resources when we intended to use it for one source and we for some reason couldn't spend it on, for example, a salary, is to use that as revenue for paying for a capital need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15714.758s">[Collins]</a>: where we otherwise wouldn't be able to amass the resources to, you know, we know that we have great capital needs in the city of Medford on so many of our public buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15726.466s">[Collins]</a>: I mean, I could list them, but we don't even really need to between our public buildings and our roads and sidewalks and the high school, you know, on the topic of analogies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15740.546s">[Collins]</a>: We don't need more, we don't need more analogies tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15743.587s">[Collins]</a>: I think what's what's what feels like a central fact to me in making any decision about where to appropriate a free cash is that, you know, to rephrase, it's in no way a sustainable or predictable revenue source I think that we can certainly expect to responsibly to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15762.755s">[Collins]</a>: less free cash certified at the end of this fiscal year than we did at the end of this one, because a lot of those areas where we weren't spending as much as we were budgeting in FY 24, I know the administration worked really hard to get those out of the budget so that we could make the most use of every dollar that we are budgeting for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15779.719s">[Collins]</a>: And I think it's incredibly irresponsible to spend funds that have a really clear<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15787.0s">[Collins]</a>: floor at the bottom of that bank account on needs that are not going away because they're part of our operating budget and they pay for the school experience and pay for teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15797.142s">[Collins]</a>: Because what are we going to do when that money is gone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15799.462s">[Collins]</a>: It's not a sustainable revenue source.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15802.163s">[Collins]</a>: But then I'm getting onto a future topic here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15805.063s">[Collins]</a>: On the topic of the MSBA feasibility study, and we're talking about transparent government and, you know, leading in a way that manifests the will of the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15814.765s">[Collins]</a>: I know that a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15816.445s">[Collins]</a>: better, safer, more vibrant, more appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15818.826s">[Collins]</a>: Medford High School is something that so many people in the community have been crying out for for such a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15823.908s">[Collins]</a>: And this appropriation is a necessary step in the process of maintaining our eligibility for getting the funding that could get us there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15832.811s">[Collins]</a>: And so this vote is crucial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15834.191s">[Collins]</a>: And I think this is an unambiguously good use for this $3 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15837.993s">[Collins]</a>: And I'll motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16825.328s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Pierce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16831.988s">[Collins]</a>: I want to preface by saying I haven't always been fully, in the past, I haven't felt fully comfortable with the volume of free cash that the city has amassed, but I think that this type of plan really puts data to the intuition that there's things, important, unskippable projects that this money is being saved and appropriated for, things that we do not have other sustainable ways of funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16858.757s">[Collins]</a>: whether it's, you know, fleet replacements in the fire department, stabilization funds, which are essentially, you know, a piggy bank for the city in the same way that a person or a household has a savings bank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16870.306s">[Collins]</a>: Communities need them for the same reasons of responding to emergencies responsibly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16878.251s">[Collins]</a>: liabilities for pensions and insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16881.713s">[Collins]</a>: I think it's really helpful to have a draft of this plan for how this, you know, you just look at the number 25 million, 34 million now, you think, wow, that's a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16890.976s">[Collins]</a>: Like, why, what are we sitting on that for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16893.117s">[Collins]</a>: And I think it's so important to have a draft plan for how it's going to be appropriated, because that number gets whittled down very, very quickly when we take stock of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16903.1s">[Collins]</a>: stabilization funds that we ought to get in line with best practices in terms of how much we are saving for those rainy days and emergencies and for the major operating capital expenses that we need funding for that we're not going to fund out of our operating budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16918.243s">[Collins]</a>: So I think that this is a great start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16920.624s">[Collins]</a>: I'm very happy to approve this tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16923.324s">[Collins]</a>: I would also want to put forward a B paper to schedule a committee of the whole to discuss the free cash plan in more detail with the council and with the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17939.292s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17940.013s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for presenting on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17941.935s">[Collins]</a>: I'm heartened to hear that the school committee already took a vote to approve this, not just because that's a step towards manifesting it, but also, you know, I would look to them to get the body's opinion on if this is a worthwhile endeavor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17954.407s">[Collins]</a>: And it means a lot to me that the school committee, you know, the majority of them thought that this was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17960.239s">[Collins]</a>: worth moving forward and, you know, this does not, in my understanding, passage of this does not automatically, of course, it doesn't automatically consolidate any functions between the city and the schools department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17972.602s">[Collins]</a>: What it does is it allows us to have those discussions about what functions might be advantageous to consolidate, might help us<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17980.684s">[Collins]</a>: streamline things that both the cities and Metro Public Schools are doing might help us save money on things that we're currently doing in two places, would allow us to have those discussions and then be able to act on them if we come to decisions that some departments are worth combining.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17995.467s">[Collins]</a>: So I will be happy to approve this tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17998.048s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18098.892s">[Collins]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18306.547s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18307.308s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for walking us through these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18308.869s">[Collins]</a>: I don't have any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18309.99s">[Collins]</a>: I know from my two previous budget years, this is a standard, you know, set of loose threads to tie up at the end of the fiscal year, just to transfer unspent funds to other departments where there were additional funds that were budgeted for and balance things out that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18328.186s">[Collins]</a>: So I'd be happy to, motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18722.383s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18723.303s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18724.604s">[Collins]</a>: I'm happy to see this before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18728.246s">[Collins]</a>: I am always pleased for the opportunity to give any member of city personnel a raise, no matter whether they are union or non-union.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18738.37s">[Collins]</a>: I think that everybody deserves raises.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18739.811s">[Collins]</a>: Everybody deserves cost of living adjustments, and it's not a zero-sum situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18744.813s">[Collins]</a>: So I'm always happy to approve raises.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18749.154s">[Collins]</a>: I would motion to approve the amendment put forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18753.256s">[Collins]</a>: I would motion to exclude CAF 22, the mayor's position from the COLA afforded to non-use and personnel between 2021 and 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18764.881s">[Collins]</a>: But beyond that, that is the only exclusion I would make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18791.913s">[Collins]</a>: I need a correction, that excluding CAF 22 only from the raises made between 2021 and 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18796.637s">[Collins]</a>: That this is only proposing January 1 and July 1, 2024?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18812.111s">[Collins]</a>: I think maybe I'm confused by the wording.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18823.08s">[Collins]</a>: This amendment makes no changes to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18831.067s">[Collins]</a>: Cap changes made prior to 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18852.683s">[Collins]</a>: Okay, I would like to amend my motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18854.844s">[Collins]</a>: I would like to approve the amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=454.053s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=455.474s">[Collins]</a>: At our June 25th meeting of the Planning and Permitting Committee, we met once again with the City Council's zoning consultant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=463.682s">[Collins]</a>: The topic this time was to go over in more detail a work plan for the remainder of the year and the term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=471.35s">[Collins]</a>: With that zoning consultant, moving plans and goals that have been placed in Medford's comprehensive plan, housing production plan<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=479.175s">[Collins]</a>: climate action and adaptation plan and other public city plans into pieces of legislation that the council can consider debate and vote on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=487.241s">[Collins]</a>: And at that meeting, we determined that the next meeting of the planning and permitting committee, which happens to be tomorrow, Wednesday, we would go over detailed zoning maps with the zoning consultant, followed by a discussion of housing related topics to further our work on global and district level zoning changes in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=506.935s">[Collins]</a>: and to begin talking about housing-related issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=510.418s">[Collins]</a>: I move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=966.003s">[Collins]</a>: President Bears, did Councilor Scarpelli move the question or is debate still out on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=986.727s">[Collins]</a>: I'll happily defer to Councilor Callahan while I collect my thoughts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1234.192s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1236.323s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli for bringing forward this topic of discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1239.205s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Callahan for your words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1250.271s">[Collins]</a>: Pardon me while I get my thoughts together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1251.551s">[Collins]</a>: I'd like to...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1258.217s">[Collins]</a>: You know, I agree that the words accountability and transparency are used so often that they tend to lose meaning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1265.401s">[Collins]</a>: And I think in this case, we're kind of having a community-wide discussion about what does transparency look like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1270.224s">[Collins]</a>: Are we currently seeing it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1271.204s">[Collins]</a>: Where aren't we seeing it that we would like to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1274.026s">[Collins]</a>: I think if we want the city council to be transparent, then we have to be the forum that states the facts where there's misinformation going around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1283.111s">[Collins]</a>: It is true that the city gets audited every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1286.598s">[Collins]</a>: That is a fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1287.939s">[Collins]</a>: I would not want to be untransparent and pretend that that is not the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1292.121s">[Collins]</a>: That is the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1293.722s">[Collins]</a>: The city is audited every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1304.127s">[Collins]</a>: It makes me saddened as a member of this council, as a colleague,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1311.823s">[Collins]</a>: to see our discussion and debate behind the rail go to this place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1317.672s">[Collins]</a>: I see bodies like this as<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1322.071s">[Collins]</a>: enacted for the purpose of having disagreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1325.453s">[Collins]</a>: We have had a lot of disagreement this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1327.835s">[Collins]</a>: We've had a lot of disagreement the previous term, my first term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1331.077s">[Collins]</a>: There was plenty of disagreement the term before that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1333.699s">[Collins]</a>: That is not a bug.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1335.14s">[Collins]</a>: That is a function.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1336.601s">[Collins]</a>: That is what democracy looks like, is getting people from the community who disagree with each other to represent the community, to have disagreements and try either by compromise or by vote<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1349.485s">[Collins]</a>: to find a path forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1351.488s">[Collins]</a>: And hopefully a lot of the time we'll find our way to the best path forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1355.735s">[Collins]</a>: And if we don't, that's why we have elections and new people take these seats and they'll have a disagreements again, and maybe they'll arrive at different<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1363.868s">[Collins]</a>: decisions by compromise or by vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1368.209s">[Collins]</a>: I think it's worth noting that the invoking of, I know that there's a couple issues at play here behind what was explicitly written about in the letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1379.232s">[Collins]</a>: I think it's worth noting that some of the inflammatory motions here that predated Councilor Scarpelli's communication to our partners at the state level,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1391.295s">[Collins]</a>: the invoking of Rule 21 and the suspension of Rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1394.758s">[Collins]</a>: I just want to state a few things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1397.46s">[Collins]</a>: One, council rules are council rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1400.822s">[Collins]</a>: We've amended the council rules in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1403.084s">[Collins]</a>: That can be put forward by any councillor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1405.386s">[Collins]</a>: That's a thing that councillors are allowed to do and that we vote on them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1410.049s">[Collins]</a>: I also think it's worth noting that rules have been suspended for time immemorial, at least as long as I've been paying attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1416.974s">[Collins]</a>: That's not new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1418.455s">[Collins]</a>: Rule 21 has been invoked since I started paying attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1421.657s">[Collins]</a>: That's not new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1423.899s">[Collins]</a>: Rules have been suspended for various reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1427.261s">[Collins]</a>: For as long as I've been watching these meetings, that's not new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1430.843s">[Collins]</a>: And I think, you know, when I look at the current climate,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1436.377s">[Collins]</a>: behind this rail at this team of people who were elected to work together and disagree together and take votes together, makes me wonder what's changed that instead of taking votes and moving on, taking votes and trying to find compromise and using the forum of the debate to try to be persuasive, try to listen in good faith and talk in good faith, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1466.906s">[Collins]</a>: This is hard for me to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1469.988s">[Collins]</a>: But a lot of people behind this rail are speaking my mind, so I think that it's only fair that in the spirit of productive disagreement, you know, we do the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1479.174s">[Collins]</a>: I think it's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1481.016s">[Collins]</a>: that any member who finds themselves on the losing side of any vote to see that for what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1488.36s">[Collins]</a>: And I think they owe it to this body to continue in the spirit of productive disagreement, not to gum up the works of the body through<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1499.918s">[Collins]</a>: making allegations or accusations of inappropriate behavior, of breaking of the rules, of inappropriateness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1509.583s">[Collins]</a>: I think that is harmful to what this body does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1512.505s">[Collins]</a>: I don't think it's fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1513.886s">[Collins]</a>: I don't think it's good sportsmanship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1516.327s">[Collins]</a>: I don't think it helps this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1519.309s">[Collins]</a>: I hope that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1522.179s">[Collins]</a>: after this spate of, frankly, misinformation that this community has been weathering and conversing about for the past couple of months, we can get back to a place where we say, we want this body to be productive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1534.368s">[Collins]</a>: We don't want to sling mud at each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1535.709s">[Collins]</a>: We don't want to use our state-level partners as a forum for trying to bring each other down by claiming inappropriateness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1548.171s">[Collins]</a>: Let's debate, let's discuss, let's disagree, let's yell at each other if we have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1552.192s">[Collins]</a>: That's nothing new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1554.152s">[Collins]</a>: And then let's take the votes and move on and let's remember that we're all here because of votes that were cast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1562.734s">[Collins]</a>: And that happens every two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1564.714s">[Collins]</a>: And I don't think it is helpful for our community at all to let<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1574.656s">[Collins]</a>: these accusations of inappropriateness and illegality or allegations that heavily imply inappropriateness and illegality into the conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1587.505s">[Collins]</a>: I don't think that is in the best interest of this body, which continues as a body after all of our terms are over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1593.33s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2842.687s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Beasley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2859.471s">[Collins]</a>: I think that being behind this rail carries a lot of responsibility, collectively and individually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2867.674s">[Collins]</a>: When I speak about allegations, part of what I mean is that the narrative that we perpetuate as individuals and as a collective, we are responsible for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2877.698s">[Collins]</a>: It's very powerful in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2880.762s">[Collins]</a>: The allegation, I think, is the narrative that has been created to draw a link between some of these events that a councilor is mentioning in past meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2897.247s">[Collins]</a>: I don't think it is responsible to further a false narrative that actions taken by this council are towards the goal of silencing an opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2909.019s">[Collins]</a>: I wanna briefly walk through a few items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2910.94s">[Collins]</a>: One, and what I mean by the narrative is I think that what we're kind of all talking around is this narrative of one counselor is being willfully silenced by collective actions of another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2924.028s">[Collins]</a>: That is a very compelling narrative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2926.19s">[Collins]</a>: That's a very compelling story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2929.972s">[Collins]</a>: I'm gonna keep talking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2943.968s">[Collins]</a>: The first meeting, Rule 21 was invoked to delay the free cash paper by one meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2949.693s">[Collins]</a>: I want to remind people that Rule 21 is an undebatable motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2953.277s">[Collins]</a>: It is not the case that this is a collective action taken to silence that idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2958.702s">[Collins]</a>: Frankly, not that it matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2960.123s">[Collins]</a>: I wasn't in favor of tabling<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2963.049s">[Collins]</a>: the free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2964.009s">[Collins]</a>: I didn't like that that happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2966.21s">[Collins]</a>: It didn't matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2966.79s">[Collins]</a>: It's undebatable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2967.97s">[Collins]</a>: It happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2968.471s">[Collins]</a>: It wasn't a collective action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2969.911s">[Collins]</a>: I don't know the councilor's intentions in doing it, but it doesn't fit this narrative of collective action to silence one group, one person, or a constituency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2980.014s">[Collins]</a>: At the next meeting, yes, I suspended the rules to say that we can't do rule 21 at this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2987.856s">[Collins]</a>: In general, I am not a fan of rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2991.266s">[Collins]</a>: I don't think it's productive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2993.729s">[Collins]</a>: I think that it's something we should discuss as a council, whether it's worth keeping inside of our council rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2998.676s">[Collins]</a>: My explicit reason for doing it at that meeting was not to be a part of a coordinated effort to silence one person, group, or constituency, but because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3008.396s">[Collins]</a>: It was my understanding, and I believe this is true, that if we were to delay the budget past, if we were to not vote on the budget at that meeting, that would have pushed us past the deadline of issuing pink slips to teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3025.81s">[Collins]</a>: And so if rule 21 had been invoked and we had tabled the budget, a lot of teachers would have gotten pink slips.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3033.737s">[Collins]</a>: I didn't have to, because the budget wouldn't have been finalized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3036.88s">[Collins]</a>: That was my understanding, and that was my motivation for taking Rule 21 off of the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3041.704s">[Collins]</a>: You can disagree with it, but it doesn't fit the narrative of just being a coordinated effort to silence one person, group, or constituency, and I won't further that narrative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3051.013s">[Collins]</a>: One other thing I want to say while I have the floor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3054.557s">[Collins]</a>: I think it's a perpetual thorn in our side, this issue of free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3059.421s">[Collins]</a>: One, because it's called such a confusing and inaccurate term, free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3066.768s">[Collins]</a>: That's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3067.349s">[Collins]</a>: It's the community's cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3075.556s">[Collins]</a>: I'm going to finish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3076.817s">[Collins]</a>: I'm going to finish my point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3083.206s">[Collins]</a>: Free cash occurs when money that was budgeted to be spent was not spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3087.768s">[Collins]</a>: It's true that we have allocated up until our last city council meeting when we appropriated some of that free cash, that it is amassed to a very large number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3099.034s">[Collins]</a>: Why are some neighboring communities have a balance of four or five million in free cash at a given time and we had 34?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3105.818s">[Collins]</a>: Because we were one of the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3109.3s">[Collins]</a>: 3% of cities and towns in Massachusetts that had never ever set up a stabilization fund, which is a savings account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3115.365s">[Collins]</a>: And that's why ours was growing and growing and growing, essentially in a checking account, a checking account that you can't use most of the year, instead of being appropriated into funds and departments where it can actually go to work for you, the taxpayers, for us, for our city departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3134.52s">[Collins]</a>: That's why that number grew so large, because we never appropriated it into a stabilization fund or a capital stabilization fund, both of which are mechanisms that we set up at the last meeting in June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3147.564s">[Collins]</a>: And I just wanna add a little bit of, I just wanted to add that context to the discussion, because I can totally understand that it sounds egregious to say we have $34 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3156.307s">[Collins]</a>: And again, my analogy, I'm not a finance expert, is to say we have $34 million in a checking account,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3162.628s">[Collins]</a>: Why the heck would that be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3164.249s">[Collins]</a>: Well, now we don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3165.571s">[Collins]</a>: Now we've put it into funds where it can actually go to use for the city, for the schools, for the taxpayers because of votes taken at the last meeting in June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3173.638s">[Collins]</a>: And I think that's important because now it can actually be put to use for the residents and taxpayers of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3476.454s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Paris.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3478.137s">[Collins]</a>: I had finished my point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3934.032s">[Collins]</a>: Sorry, there's just so much to talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3935.513s">[Collins]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3941.336s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3944.397s">[Collins]</a>: You know, I think this is one of those issues where I think we really do agree in what we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3950.699s">[Collins]</a>: And we see it, we see what's happening differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3956.26s">[Collins]</a>: What really nettles me is we have so much, it's not like what we say, people in the community believe, because obviously that's not the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3967.003s">[Collins]</a>: But I think we, having one of these microphones is really powerful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3971.145s">[Collins]</a>: It comes with a lot of influence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3973.7s">[Collins]</a>: And I think every person behind this rail is in their way, in their different ways, really sensitive to the role that they occupy, the voice that they have, how people hear them, how they're framing the issues, how they're hearing the issues from the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3989.349s">[Collins]</a>: I know that every counselor behind this rail is very sensitive to the type<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3994.509s">[Collins]</a>: of leader and listener and speaker and representative that they are perceived to be by the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4001.771s">[Collins]</a>: And that's why it is so upsetting to me when behind this rail, we further narratives and binaries that I think are both not true, but actively harmful to our ability to come together and work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4018.037s">[Collins]</a>: For example, setting up a binary between<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4023.43s">[Collins]</a>: talking about your assumptions and opinions as though they are fact in a city council meeting versus meeting with department heads who are duplicitous to further your own agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4036.153s">[Collins]</a>: That binary does not exist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4039.053s">[Collins]</a>: And I don't think it is helpful to put that forward as your two options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4044.815s">[Collins]</a>: That's not what happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4047.115s">[Collins]</a>: That's not what happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4049.356s">[Collins]</a>: I also don't think it's helpful<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4053.584s">[Collins]</a>: to set up a binary between winning a vote and being actively silenced, we've all been on the losing side of the vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4069.575s">[Collins]</a>: And whether we feel maligned by that or victimized by that, I don't think it's fair to how we talk about these issues to get to pick and choose when we're going to waive that as a flag.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4083.772s">[Collins]</a>: And it's not that I want to minimize the experience of having something that you ardently believe in and getting shot down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4090.336s">[Collins]</a>: I know that sucks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4092.057s">[Collins]</a>: I've been there many times, my first term especially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4097.36s">[Collins]</a>: But I think it is deeply unhelpful to the community, to this body being able to function at what it's supposed to do for us to broadcast that our two options are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4110.387s">[Collins]</a>: be a winning vote for some nefarious agenda or be a stymied, silenced constituency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4117.369s">[Collins]</a>: Because I think that, you know, we talk about that's why we're divided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4122.13s">[Collins]</a>: There's nothing more dividing than being told we're divided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4126.091s">[Collins]</a>: I wish that we came into these conversations not already mad at each other, but willing to say what's happening here and being willing to listen to the answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4137.454s">[Collins]</a>: We had a conversation with the finance director<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4140.401s">[Collins]</a>: before the budget about free cash projections, what it's been in the past, what is projected to be, why free cash accumulates the way that it does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4149.448s">[Collins]</a>: I don't think it's fair to residents to keep having this conversation about how our accumulation of free cash, which has now been put into funds where it can be used for purposes throughout the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4161.318s">[Collins]</a>: I don't think it's fair to the residents to keep talking about this like it was some scheme.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4169.532s">[Collins]</a>: I don't get why it's fair to the people of this city to keep beating a drum that misinforms people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4181.263s">[Collins]</a>: It's okay if you disagree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4182.584s">[Collins]</a>: I just wish that we were able to talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4185.146s">[Collins]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4714.482s">[Collins]</a>: Hopefully this will be the last time I speak on this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4716.342s">[Collins]</a>: I just wanted to note two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4721.544s">[Collins]</a>: I hear you that you wish there had been minutes coming out of the financial task force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4726.525s">[Collins]</a>: You know, maybe the next time this is necessary, it'll be formed by committee instead of being a flexible ad hoc group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4735.401s">[Collins]</a>: thing is that any decisions that came out of this task force were put to a vote in a public meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4740.724s">[Collins]</a>: And I also think it's really relevant to note, I think it's a very critical distinction that any proposals came out that were discussed in the financial task force, of which I was a member, put forward to the city council, we approved them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4760.477s">[Collins]</a>: Any residents who feel<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4765.712s">[Collins]</a>: skeptical or uncomfortable or just disapproving of the proposals or of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4773.634s">[Collins]</a>: What do you do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4774.254s">[Collins]</a>: You go to the polls and you vote no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4778.095s">[Collins]</a>: And that's the difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4779.515s">[Collins]</a>: You can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4780.875s">[Collins]</a>: That's your right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4782.195s">[Collins]</a>: That's your right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4783.716s">[Collins]</a>: From now until the election, residents who happen to be in favor of the proposals<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4789.813s">[Collins]</a>: we'll be making the case for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4792.154s">[Collins]</a>: There will be a lot of answers coming out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4795.115s">[Collins]</a>: That's the process, because this is a thing that everybody gets to vote yes or no on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4799.937s">[Collins]</a>: We will not be making that case from the podium because this is a matter that's going to be voted on, that would be improper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4805.979s">[Collins]</a>: But this information, this case will be made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4808.38s">[Collins]</a>: We will have a chance to discuss and debate the answer to those questions by we, I mean the community, in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4818.183s">[Collins]</a>: Let's see if I can remember the second point I was going to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4820.004s">[Collins]</a>: I might have lost it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4827.706s">[Collins]</a>: It's been a long day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4829.887s">[Collins]</a>: We'll come back to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4830.887s">[Collins]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4892.522s">[Collins]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4893.222s">[Collins]</a>: Okay, I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4894.122s">[Collins]</a>: I'm sorry, I remember the point I was gonna make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4897.223s">[Collins]</a>: I know, you're all thrilled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4899.844s">[Collins]</a>: I do just want to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4902.267s">[Collins]</a>: highlight, remind folks that the council did take a vote to have a committee of the whole, maybe sometime in the summer, early in the fall, to meet, to have a public meeting where the administration is present and we discuss the use of funds in our stabilization account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4916.596s">[Collins]</a>: Just to let that be known, that's a vote that was already taken so that we can have a public discussion about free cash, where it went, how it's going to be used, because I know the administration has had a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4929.17s">[Collins]</a>: ton of capital needs that a lot of that funding is already in demand for these capital projects that were already in the queue, paving, sidewalk repair, city infrastructure, and so on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4944.519s">[Collins]</a>: I also think it's worth noting that the difference between saying, let's not even propose an override versus putting an override on the ballot and it fails,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4959.221s">[Collins]</a>: Same outcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4961.022s">[Collins]</a>: And lastly, I wanna note, again, I was not in favor of the Rule 21 motion to delay the vote on Councilor Scarpelli's free cash paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4972.29s">[Collins]</a>: The fact that we set up a stabilization fund and a capital stabilization fund and moved some of our 34 million reserves of free cash into the stabilization funds means that we can now use it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4986.616s">[Collins]</a>: Because of that, we could now use that money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4989.359s">[Collins]</a>: And if we hadn't done that, that money would be unusable to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4993.983s">[Collins]</a>: That's a fact, you can shake your head, but that's a fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4997.086s">[Collins]</a>: While the state is certifying free cash, we cannot touch it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4999.488s">[Collins]</a>: And I still have not heard a compelling reason why making that surplus, that cash reserves unavailable to the community for the needs that we know we have, I fail to see<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5011.621s">[Collins]</a>: why that is a better outcome than having it in funds where it is available to be used for the needs that we know we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5018.288s">[Collins]</a>: And I'm sorry, I really will shut up now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6437.206s">[Collins]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=405.543s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=406.723s">[Collins]</a>: Ken, just want to thank you so much for once again coming before the council to, you know, for folks who don't already know some of that history and context about the Chevalier, and for folks who know a little bit, maybe know it as an event venue, but haven't interfaced with what a community center it is and how much good it provides, not just as an entertainment center in Medford Square, but as a historic piece of property that's utilized by so many types of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=432.153s">[Collins]</a>: in our community with our neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=433.794s">[Collins]</a>: I think it's always great to shine a spotlight on that, and thank you so much for your work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=856.1s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Barras, Councilor Tseng, thank you so much for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=859.461s">[Collins]</a>: As time goes on, it seems to me, I notice in lots of ways how much easier it is to be destructive than it is to be constructive or to do good or proactive things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=877.745s">[Collins]</a>: case in point, you know, we have this hateful, divisive, self-serving, disgusting language, especially when it's propagated by national figures, that can very rapidly escalate to real harm against real people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=893.911s">[Collins]</a>: It is much easier to say something horrible to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=901.894s">[Collins]</a>: trump up feelings in your base to achieve some kind of political ends than it is to use words to cultivate a society where people really are welcomed, really are supported, really are brought together, so easy to be divisive, so hard to cultivate genuine and true inclusivity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=922.293s">[Collins]</a>: And I think we see that in lots of ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=924.555s">[Collins]</a>: But all that being said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=925.996s">[Collins]</a>: I think it is still really important for bodies such as ours to try to counter that negative, hateful rhetoric with positive rhetoric whenever we can at every opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=937.409s">[Collins]</a>: Often it's in reaction to something that should never have been spoken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=941.373s">[Collins]</a>: So I thank you for the opportunity for us to affirm as a city council, one,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=946.599s">[Collins]</a>: unequivocally condemning this incident that happened in Ohio and the harm that was caused and those who sought to enrich themselves politically because of it and to stand with people who are affected by that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=960.791s">[Collins]</a>: And also to affirm here in Medford, whether you were born here or not born here or not born in this country, you're part of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=969.318s">[Collins]</a>: We're so glad you're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=971.96s">[Collins]</a>: Let's stay together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=973.081s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=974.342s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for the opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1443.868s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1445.128s">[Collins]</a>: At the Planning and Permitting Committee meeting last week, the topic that we discussed with our zoning consultant was green score and incentive zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1454.732s">[Collins]</a>: This was kind of a preliminary discussion on both of those topics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1457.673s">[Collins]</a>: And so we will be meeting about them again before we take any votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1462.815s">[Collins]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1474.682s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1938.493s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1939.234s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for appearing before us today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1940.775s">[Collins]</a>: And I definitely appreciate, you know, the spirit of compromise with the amended proposal that you put forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1947.401s">[Collins]</a>: I think that, you know, Councilor Scarponi brings up, you know, one of the most important things before this council, which is just making sure that the special permits that we extend are consistent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1955.208s">[Collins]</a>: I appreciate the research that you and your company did to see what other<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1960.513s">[Collins]</a>: what special permits have been granted to other restaurants to kind of keep in line with those norms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1968.399s">[Collins]</a>: I personally, I think that I would be willing to approve this tonight and perhaps attach a 30, 60 and 90 day review to it so that we could continue to keep in contact with city partners and local residents and as you say, you know, collaborate to if there are issues arise because of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1985.05s">[Collins]</a>: Midnight closing Monday through Thursday and 1 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1987.952s">[Collins]</a>: Closing Friday Saturday Sunday We can return and adjust that at those intervals But before putting forward a motion, I'd be happy to hear opinions from my fellow councillors Thank You Vice President Collins, Councilor Leming<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2323.639s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2324.54s">[Collins]</a>: I definitely appreciate the discussion around this and completely respect my councilors' various perspectives on the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2331.924s">[Collins]</a>: I would motion to approve the amended petition pending the public comment period and with the 30, 60, and 90-day review attached.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2726.653s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2727.874s">[Collins]</a>: I think anything that the city can do to make it easier for residents and visitors to enjoy our public spaces, we should at least look into doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2735.2s">[Collins]</a>: Totally hear Councilor Tseng when he says, you know, nobody's under the impression that this is something we could roll out in six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2741.885s">[Collins]</a>: Of course not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2742.585s">[Collins]</a>: But, you know, all the more reason to start the conversation in partnership with city partners to see, you know, what can we learn from our neighboring communities that are rolling out this kind of program more and more so that we can, you know, kind of keep up with our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2755.615s">[Collins]</a>: with our regional neighbors and being able to offer that to people in our public spaces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3281.797s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3283.538s">[Collins]</a>: Appreciate you being with us today, Director Blake, and for communicating about this ahead of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3287.879s">[Collins]</a>: My only major question going into this appropriation request was essentially why this, why no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3293.942s">[Collins]</a>: I think that's been laid out very clearly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3297.304s">[Collins]</a>: This is, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3298.484s">[Collins]</a>: This is an example of one of the reasons that I'm so glad that this council in partnership with the administration was able to finally set up a capital stabilization fund this year because this, it seems to me from the description given safety really is substandard at this location it's really important that we take an opportunity to bring it up to par and so important that we have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3319.635s">[Collins]</a>: funds to pay for those improvements that we can actually access, which is not the case with a free cash balance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3326.817s">[Collins]</a>: We wouldn't be able to access it to leverage it for this project, and safety would go on being compromised or substandard at this location, and that's just not what our residents of this city deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3340.161s">[Collins]</a>: So I am very excited to take our first couple of votes this evening on, I think, what are very worthy capital stabilization fund appropriation requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3348.784s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4064.278s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4065.159s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you to my fellow colleagues for a substantive conversation around this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4070.723s">[Collins]</a>: I just wanna recenter that we are talking about capital stabilization fund appropriation requests and not an override and not about financial mismanagement of which there's been no evidence in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4084.893s">[Collins]</a>: I would motion to approve the papers before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4391.001s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for the context and kind of speaking to how this is grounded in not just decommissioning a vehicle that's been in heavy rotation for such a long time, but bringing us closer to our local climate goals and keeping in line with the state climate goals as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4409.236s">[Collins]</a>: Of course, we want to be keeping up with our municipal neighbors and doing our part as a municipality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4414.92s">[Collins]</a>: This seems, as you outlined, there's no other funding for this, and this is something that we need, and something that we need, I think, in terms of municipal timelines fairly urgently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4425.027s">[Collins]</a>: With that in mind, I think this vote to me is unambiguous, and I would actually like to make a motion to reconsider the previous vote to sever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4432.492s">[Collins]</a>: To me, these are both slam dunk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4433.793s">[Collins]</a>: I think we should consider them at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4436.795s">[Collins]</a>: So that's a motion to reconsider.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4438.576s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4580.164s">[Collins]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4602.179s">[Collins]</a>: I will restate my motion to approve both of the appropriation requests before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=117.115s">[Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=958.59s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you to President Barras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=959.811s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being with us today to give us some context on this item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=966.356s">[Collins]</a>: As has been discussed, it's always sobering to hear of having to potentially put on the table a little bit more than we initially thought would have to be budgeted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=975.342s">[Collins]</a>: You know, unfortunately, we're in a fiscal environment where that is happening across the board because the cost of all sorts of infrastructural tools, materials and services are more expensive than they've been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=986.388s">[Collins]</a>: You know, when these estimates were made several years in the past due to inflation and other factors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=990.35s">[Collins]</a>: And I think that this is one of those scenarios where, you know, it never feels great to have to spend more than we had initially forecast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=998.214s">[Collins]</a>: But this is still a non-negotiable and I think it is well worth<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1003.317s">[Collins]</a>: spending a little bit more to make sure that what we are investing in is more resilient for the future when we know these systems will, you know, have to be maintained, have to be upgraded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1013.226s">[Collins]</a>: And if we're going to be putting money on the table at all, I'd rather it be getting us closer to our climate goals and be a part of a new, more resilient system for our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1021.494s">[Collins]</a>: You already covered the questions that I had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1022.775s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1024.016s">[Collins]</a>: And I would be happy to motion to approve this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1107.44s">[Collins]</a>: Yeah, do you have any more specifics about like which which roadways are going to be worked on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2334.687s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2335.988s">[Collins]</a>: Appreciate this discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2339.032s">[Collins]</a>: I appreciate this discussion also being put in the context of the other budgeting tools that the Council goes through throughout the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2346.965s">[Collins]</a>: It seems to me that the questions of negotiations are ones that the administration forecasts and creates its container for during the annual budgeting process, which we of course went through this past June and will again for FY26 starting next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2361.912s">[Collins]</a>: And I also just want to remind the Council that the appropriations before us are from the capital, the capital stabilization fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2370.356s">[Collins]</a>: So the money requests, the appropriation requests that are before us are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2375.416s">[Collins]</a>: limited to appropriation for capital spending purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2378.417s">[Collins]</a>: And they are very limited in that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2382.298s">[Collins]</a>: These are not dollars that could be used for any purpose at all in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2385.999s">[Collins]</a>: They are limited to capital expenditures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2389.28s">[Collins]</a>: And that is why we are considering infrastructural and maintenance projects before us this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2395.922s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2638.274s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=929.382s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=930.042s">[Collins]</a>: Nothing substantive to add, but just in summary, on top of what Vice President Bears just said, I think the substantive change in A is to bring that use table into alignment with the community's goals for that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=944.653s">[Collins]</a>: through regulating mechanical car park uses to bring an alignment with community wishes and our comprehensive plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=951.116s">[Collins]</a>: The rest I think are technical corrections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=953.136s">[Collins]</a>: And in some cases, Scribner's errors, typos that we've, we and other bodies have noticed are in the zoning ordinance in the, a little over a year that we've been using it since the first pre-convocation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1422.79s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Merlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1423.891s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Director Hunt and Planner Evans for walking us through this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1428.156s">[Collins]</a>: As was just stated, I think that the primary goal of putting these changes forward was to remove some of these uses by right because we want to mitigate how much they're encroaching on our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1438.228s">[Collins]</a>: valuable land in this area that we could put to many other uses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1442.211s">[Collins]</a>: And it seems like with these recommendations on the slight amendments that the city board sent back, there's kind of a secondary goal of making it more consistent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1449.317s">[Collins]</a>: Who is reviewing the special permit applications when they do come in aligning that with the right board to be reviewing it and making sure that the same board is reviewing for the same types of uses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1459.805s">[Collins]</a>: So I think that that is really aligned with what we're trying to do with the zoning ordinance in general, making things both blend with our use goals and also just keeping things more consistent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1468.59s">[Collins]</a>: user-friendly inside and outside of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1471.051s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1682.958s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2532.279s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Merlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2533.559s">[Collins]</a>: I also appreciate this being put forward into the constituents that have been advocating about this, some of them for a pretty long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2539.481s">[Collins]</a>: As Councilor Tseng mentioned, this has been, I mean, this is always coming up, but it's been coming up over the past couple weeks over a couple of different topics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2549.204s">[Collins]</a>: And this council has<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2551.605s">[Collins]</a>: spent a lot of time talking about the lack of code enforcement resources in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2556.029s">[Collins]</a>: This comes up every budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2557.43s">[Collins]</a>: It's something that we, and by we, I mean as a city, not as a council, can't seem to fund and expand resources for that department nearly fast enough at the rate that we know there's a clear need for and that residents are on a daily basis observing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2573.524s">[Collins]</a>: the need for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2574.744s">[Collins]</a>: Obviously, rules are not self-enforcing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2576.605s">[Collins]</a>: I think that these suggestions are really good to try to nip in the bud the problem of Airbnbs and things like them proliferating in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2585.388s">[Collins]</a>: And then we need an expanded code enforcement office to be following up on problems like these and all of the many other problems from potholes to obstructed sidewalks to overgrowth that residents are reporting every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2600.774s">[Collins]</a>: in our community, and I really do regret and resent that when we exist at these substandard staffing and resource levels for basic city functions, it means that residents have to be code enforcement officers, and I really don't think that's fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2614.041s">[Collins]</a>: I don't think community members should have to be that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2616.122s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3664.056s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell, and I appreciate this bringing forward because it's, you know, essentially an example of what we've been talking about is what can we do to make it so these problems aren't happening in the first place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3673.878s">[Collins]</a>: And I think the housing stability notification ordinance is a good example because that's using our existing city communication channels just to distribute what is information that's already existing rules that already exist, you know, using an existing communication channel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3689.762s">[Collins]</a>: I think that that paired with having a liaison to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3692.947s">[Collins]</a>: you know, Airbnb or a similar company, these are ways of saying, hey, before anybody starts doing anything that you may not know in good faith that you shouldn't be doing, here's how things work in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3702.674s">[Collins]</a>: That paired with more robust enforcement, I think that that's what we should be rolling out for every, you know, all of these frequent flyer city problems that we know we see all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5072.924s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5073.664s">[Collins]</a>: I also just want to say thank you, Mr. Scullin, for working with Councilor Caraviello to raise this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5079.228s">[Collins]</a>: I'm sorry that it's taken you such a long time and been bounced from department to department to try to give voice to this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5086.953s">[Collins]</a>: You speak very movingly about the need to, as a city and as working with our state agencies, to keep doing a better job of, you know, not always just catering to the average user, but centering people who are disabled, either temporarily or permanently,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5102.561s">[Collins]</a>: All types of people need to get on the T, and this T station was built for all of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5105.905s">[Collins]</a>: So thank you for bringing this forward, and I'm sure that we're all going to stay on it to make sure that there are disabled parking spaces near this T station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5112.132s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6086.983s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6091.356s">[Collins]</a>: I appreciate you bringing this up and I think that this, these two, this resolution and vice president beers is for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6098.705s">[Collins]</a>: They rhyme together because when you look at the experience of this particular household on Emory Street and I had the opportunity to speak with one of the neighbors there as well as with representatives from our Board of Health Department and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6109.457s">[Collins]</a>: There were a lot of details from this particular episode, which would not shock most people in the city who live with, you know, chronic code violations, you know, as a matter of course, but are still shocking to hear, you know, the way in which this particular, you know, quote unquote resolution was trying to be achieved to a truly unsatisfactory way, how much time it took.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6132.401s">[Collins]</a>: But we're talking about the need to reallocate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6137.515s">[Collins]</a>: or find new resources to make sure that we're spending money where it's going to be meaningful for our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6141.82s">[Collins]</a>: Because currently, you know, I spoke to the Board of Health and they said, I think it was about a different household with a vermin problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6148.769s">[Collins]</a>: They said, you know, same thing that you heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6150.791s">[Collins]</a>: The one inspector that we have for that in this apartment is out on vacation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6154.756s">[Collins]</a>: And when she gets back, she will start to work through<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6157.279s">[Collins]</a>: the queue that has been amassing for her ever since she took her vacation, which I'm sure was extremely deserved because she's the only person doing this type of inspection in the entire city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6166.385s">[Collins]</a>: No person is a superhero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6167.766s">[Collins]</a>: This is an extremely severe misallocation of resources problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6172.228s">[Collins]</a>: And the downstream effect is that residents feel the lack of responsibility and the lack of communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6177.852s">[Collins]</a>: And they see their complaints going under investigated and unresolved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6181.614s">[Collins]</a>: And that's not because our city staff are doing a bad job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6184.696s">[Collins]</a>: It's because there just aren't enough of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6187.421s">[Collins]</a>: And I know that we all feel that frustration day in and day out when we get these emails and calls, and we know that we feel it every meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6194.046s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7594.565s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7597.126s">[Collins]</a>: I appreciate this discussion and I always find it, I'm always gratified we have the opportunity to make it clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7604.428s">[Collins]</a>: I think for the benefit of residents and knowing how to navigate our government, what specifically the powers of this council are and on what matters, we have to be advocates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7616.071s">[Collins]</a>: And sometimes being the role of an advocate can be very gratifying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7618.572s">[Collins]</a>: I mean, we've talked a lot about different ways of addressing this enforcement problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7624.093s">[Collins]</a>: Throughout this meeting we've talked about you know the resolutions that are out because we've talked about we've tried to do in budget seasons, we've talked about convening a meeting with the building department and code enforcement and dpw and the mayor's office to talk about how can we address this from multiple angles we've talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7640.026s">[Collins]</a>: better allocating revenue to better fund these specific departments that we know need to be at least doubled, it seems like, if not more so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7648.331s">[Collins]</a>: I also really appreciate bringing up pilot, you know, pilot agreements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7652.894s">[Collins]</a>: I, you know, as a Tufts alum myself, I feel like it needs to be, I try to say as often as possible,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7659.978s">[Collins]</a>: This is specifically an area because the neighborhoods that that affects that Tufts puts a lot of I would call, you know, abstract or immaterial things into its pilot agreement with the city, and we have existing material needs that are going on that that are exacerbated by the presence of the university for all the good that it does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7676.182s">[Collins]</a>: This is another issue where I think it's one where this council, what if it could would make direct appropriations more directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7683.084s">[Collins]</a>: help with these problems, and in a lot of cases we can't do those things, you know, just like making resolutions to advocate in the budget for allocations that should be made to put more resources into code enforcement and whatever else we need to start meeting residents' needs, you know, I would love to see us build up a process like that with PILOT as well, so that it's more related to the actual needs going unmet in this community, and not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7710.945s">[Collins]</a>: these, you know, less than immediately relevant community functions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7716.908s">[Collins]</a>: When, you know, I mean, we've been talking about code enforcement for feels like five hours, you know, it can go on all week just talking about code enforcement with the issues that get brought up to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7728.854s">[Collins]</a>: So I, I appreciate all the energy around coming to this issue from a lot of different angles, I think that we need to advocate for all of it, you know, the stuff that we can do directly legislatively,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7740.964s">[Collins]</a>: we'll continue to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7742.285s">[Collins]</a>: We'll continue to advocate around the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7743.726s">[Collins]</a>: I think that we should redouble our efforts to, you know, for this council to advocate around pilot as we do around the budget as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7749.309s">[Collins]</a>: But I appreciate everybody who's weighed in on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8193.195s">[Collins]</a>: Sorry, where are we sending this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8689.273s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell, and thank you, Vice President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8691.414s">[Collins]</a>: I think that was very eloquently put.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8695.437s">[Collins]</a>: As I like to remind people, I'm a Tufts alumni, so this is my atonement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8701.921s">[Collins]</a>: Just kidding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8704.643s">[Collins]</a>: But as an alumna, I do feel a particular responsibility to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8709.79s">[Collins]</a>: speak up in this case for the Tufts resident assistants who are seeking simply just to collectively bargain and a fair contract with their employer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8719.714s">[Collins]</a>: I also want to remind people that we're talking about an institution with a $2.4 billion endowment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8725.556s">[Collins]</a>: This is the same institution with a $2.4 billion endowment that doesn't pay taxes to us and does not volunteer to help us fill the gaping holes in our various municipal civil service needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8739.581s">[Collins]</a>: Particular to the Tufts RAs fight, you know, I think that, you know, labor is labor and workers are workers and it's time to stop entertaining the narrative that seeking to collectively bargain is anything other than reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8752.223s">[Collins]</a>: I wish that Tufts would more enthusiastically respond with that attitude.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8756.724s">[Collins]</a>: All experts, I mean, all workers are the experts on their work and RAs are the experts on their role in the campus community, which of course affects the Medford community in myriad ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8768.226s">[Collins]</a>: They stabilize and counsel and provide logistical support for the dorms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8771.708s">[Collins]</a>: And I think it's also true that the dorms that they serve have become more complicated and more needful in the past few years because of the pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8780.554s">[Collins]</a>: So I'm thankful to my fellow counselors and community members for coming together to say, you know, Tufts has to quickly proceed towards a compromise solution and a fair contract because anything other than that would be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8795.202s">[Collins]</a>: Candidly, a truly bizarre waste of their administrative time and resources, of which we know they have many.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8800.626s">[Collins]</a>: And we know that there's so many more important needs that those could be put to, not just making the campus experience more livable for those living and working on campus, but for the community as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8815.058s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9546.128s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9548.09s">[Collins]</a>: Very briefly, and I think that if I might speculate, I think that the point here is not that there's a strategy that should be taken, but just that clearly the process<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9556.88s">[Collins]</a>: is broken and that's why we see these labor disputes, these labor struggles in our own community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9562.085s">[Collins]</a>: And I think that we all want to see the overarching process change so that workers in our community, whether they're workers in our community that work for City Hall or workers in our community that happen to live on Tufts for now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9573.715s">[Collins]</a>: that they can collectively bargain in a way that they can efficiently proceed to a just outcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9579.399s">[Collins]</a>: And I'm really heartened, and I think that this resolution and previous ones that the city council has worked on are evidence of this, that everybody behind this rail takes the opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9589.147s">[Collins]</a>: And everybody in this community, I think for the most part, takes the opportunity to stand with labor when they can on the actions that they feel that they can take.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9595.391s">[Collins]</a>: And behind this rail, I think it's our right to sometimes have different ideas of what is possible for us to do and what's strategic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9601.676s">[Collins]</a>: That's our right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9602.617s">[Collins]</a>: We have a diversity of opinions, but I think when push comes to shove, we are all doing our best to stand with the laborers and the workers in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9610.004s">[Collins]</a>: With that, I would move for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9667.894s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9671.176s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=794.81s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=797.131s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=798.132s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for being before us again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=799.733s">[Collins]</a>: We always appreciate you keeping us updated meeting after meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=804.188s">[Collins]</a>: I would second the motion to table this to a date certain, and I certainly appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=807.611s">[Collins]</a>: I know you've put time into keeping us briefed on where negotiations and putting together the agreement is at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=813.896s">[Collins]</a>: I think you've done a wonderful job of putting the project into scope pretty efficiently for us in the past, and it's my hope that if we meet on this at our first or second regular meeting in January with those final details ironed out, hopefully we can approve this and dispense with it and get you and the offices on to the next step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1257.425s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell, and I appreciate you bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1259.927s">[Collins]</a>: Vice President Bears, we've spoken at length already in previous council meetings about the original reasons for bringing forward the request for an election postmortem and report, the errors and mishandlings that happened on election day, which again, were addressed, which should not have happened, and we need to know exactly how they won't happen again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1284.144s">[Collins]</a>: And then the issues and mishandlings that happened leading up to the recount and needing a full accounting of why those happened and how exactly we'll know they won't happen again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1294.989s">[Collins]</a>: To me, this is on the institutional scale, an example of people don't plan to fail, they fail to plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1306.374s">[Collins]</a>: We've discussed how going into this election,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1309.147s">[Collins]</a>: There were serious concerns about the capacity of the elections department because its staffing had dropped so low below its previous levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1319.554s">[Collins]</a>: And I think we really need to see, we need to see the diagnostic of what exactly happened and why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1324.597s">[Collins]</a>: And we need to investigate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1326.411s">[Collins]</a>: First, the Elections Commission, the Elections Department, and then as a community, as a council, we need to investigate what needs to happen so that we can go into our three very consequential elections in 2024 with the Elections Office and the Elections Commission feeling professional and organized and competent so that every voter and every resident in Medford can feel confident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1346.89s">[Collins]</a>: about the three, again, very consequential elections that we will have in 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1351.512s">[Collins]</a>: And I do think it bears emphasizing that by the time that we hear back from the Elections Commission at our January meeting, it will be less than two months until the first of those three elections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1364.636s">[Collins]</a>: So I think everybody shares a sense of disappointment that it's necessary to have this conversation at all, that it's necessary to put a deadline on it because we haven't gotten a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1376.004s">[Collins]</a>: really any response so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1379.326s">[Collins]</a>: But if it takes imposing accountability at the outset until this commission and the department can be imposing accountability from within, it's non-negotiable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1389.792s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2843.852s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2846.906s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Murrell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2848.167s">[Collins]</a>: I appreciate you asking the question in a public forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2851.629s">[Collins]</a>: My impression is that nothing is certain here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2855.371s">[Collins]</a>: We got this heads up that Councilor Scarpelli, thank you for sharing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2859.073s">[Collins]</a>: My impression from receiving that same communication a couple weeks ago is that this is still in flux and the mayor is still<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2867.375s">[Collins]</a>: in conversation with state partners who is in conversation with this landlord to determine when the state picks a site, will it be this one or will it be another one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2876.738s">[Collins]</a>: And I think in this case, no news really is no news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2881.579s">[Collins]</a>: So I just don't want us to get ahead of ourselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2883.679s">[Collins]</a>: It's also, and again, I think if this were to go forward, we should get solid answers from the people who really know for sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2891.241s">[Collins]</a>: But I think the conception of this temporary shelter is not to be a months long<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2897.664s">[Collins]</a>: for any of these migrant families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2899.145s">[Collins]</a>: It's more like away station families would stay for a couple of nights, so I don't think it's in any way certain that this would cause a burden on our public school system because we're not going to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2932.301s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2932.761s">[Collins]</a>: And yeah, I think it's certainly, certainly be great to circle back with the executive office to ask the question of what's the status?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2938.826s">[Collins]</a>: Is this going forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2939.767s">[Collins]</a>: I interpreted that email as not, we're extending this so that families, any given family will stay through June, but rather this will remain a way station for two or three nights at a time, just for a couple more months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2951.237s">[Collins]</a>: So certainly appreciate all the questions asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2954.119s">[Collins]</a>: My assumption is that this is just certainly still up in the air as many, you know, large infrastructural, you know, sure social infrastructural or if I could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2961.61s">[Collins]</a>: I also think that, you know, certainly asking for an update I'm sure that, you know, trying to sort this out at the end of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2972.11s">[Collins]</a>: but sort of recentering on the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2974.572s">[Collins]</a>: We know that we have a shelter crisis in Massachusetts at this time of year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2978.636s">[Collins]</a>: If this is an opportunity where marshaling state resources, Medford can be a port in the storm for vulnerable migrant families, I think that's another important safety piece to put into the conversation is the lack of safety that's putting these families into the situation to begin with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3618.604s">[Collins]</a>: Councilor Garabiello, it's been an honor to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3625.982s">[Collins]</a>: serve alongside you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3629.103s">[Collins]</a>: Nobody knows I have the best seat in the chambers because Rick has the best gossip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3636.124s">[Collins]</a>: You've always offered me advice, unsolicited advice that's been true every time, solicited advice that's been very useful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3647.435s">[Collins]</a>: You know, I know that you care about the success of this community, and you care about the success of this city, and you care about the success of this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3655.06s">[Collins]</a>: No matter who's behind the rail, you want us to be doing the best work that we can for the benefit of the people that live here, and that's evident in everything that you do and how you spend your time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3663.344s">[Collins]</a>: So thank you for your partnership with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3666.626s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for working with me in good faith every week over the past two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3670.469s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for your service for so many years, and excited to see what you do next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3676.481s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6154.738s">[Collins]</a>: Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6158.421s">[Collins]</a>: Councilor Knight, we're sorry to see you go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6160.282s">[Collins]</a>: You leave big shoes to fill on this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6164.206s">[Collins]</a>: I know a lot of people have remarked upon it, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6166.499s">[Collins]</a>: Your depth of institutional knowledge has been such an asset to this council in the two years that I've been involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6171.98s">[Collins]</a>: We're going to need somebody to step up and learn every line of parliamentary procedure to save us from those future kind of borderline situations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6180.381s">[Collins]</a>: And we're like, oh, is that a simple or a super majority?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6183.322s">[Collins]</a>: Because we always counted on you to know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6186.182s">[Collins]</a>: But in all seriousness, I think that your respect and your affection for the city is spelled in the rigor that you've always brought to this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6195.071s">[Collins]</a>: role, you have a razor-sharp sense of right and wrong, you don't suffer fools gladly, and I think that there's been many topics that we've discussed on the council, many papers that we've deliberated where that has been an asset to the outcomes because we've always been focused on making sure that the city is headed in the right direction and that the council is doing the right thing, that the council is doing its job as you see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6220.462s">[Collins]</a>: And that's always been very clear and I as one council have always appreciated it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6225.247s">[Collins]</a>: Best of luck to you and your family and everything that lies before you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6227.868s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for your service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6229.368s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6969.331s">[Collins]</a>: Maybe this will be one of the last very long list of unenviable tasks in your tenure as president of the City Council is calling on people to then speak about you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6981.18s">[Collins]</a>: Well, Nicole, it's hard to know where to start in congratulating you on your two terms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6987.145s">[Collins]</a>: Surely this must be one of the densest tenures of any Medford City Councilor to serve two years during a pandemic and then two as president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6997.754s">[Collins]</a>: It's pretty remarkable what you've been able to accomplish in your two terms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7002.778s">[Collins]</a>: And I think, you know, a phrase that I heard from you that I learned from you is occupying spaces that weren't designed for people like you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7010.624s">[Collins]</a>: I think often about how you were running for city council two years before I did in completely certain terms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7022.503s">[Collins]</a>: gave the way for myself and people like me to think about engaging in civic life in ways that are not traditional, that never felt possible or likely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7031.835s">[Collins]</a>: And that's a gift that you gave to not just myself for this opportunity, but for the community of Medford for allowing, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7040.828s">[Collins]</a>: representation to blossom and become better and become more representative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7046.353s">[Collins]</a>: And as that continues to expand and to blossom over time, you will have been a crucial ingredient in that for future generations of Medford City Councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7059.364s">[Collins]</a>: I think it deserves repeating that you've presided over a really effective, a really civil,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7067.597s">[Collins]</a>: a friendlier Council than has always been true and I think that's a real benefit to the effectiveness of this Council I think that's a benefit to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7075.26s">[Collins]</a>: I think that it makes City Hall more welcoming and inclusive space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7079.681s">[Collins]</a>: And that's just so important and that will continue after you as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7087.083s">[Collins]</a>: so many projects that I hope that you can really feel the gravity of as you leave office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7092.608s">[Collins]</a>: You were pushing for our zoning overhaul for two years before I was ever elected, and that's going to be a defining feature of the term ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7102.637s">[Collins]</a>: In so many ways, you've teed us up for, you've teed up the future council, perhaps the council after that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7109.083s">[Collins]</a>: for success with the projects that you've advocated for, that you've worked for, with the relationships that you've cultivated with members of, with City Hall staff, and with the new and better expectations that we have come to set for this City Council and that residents and staff have come to set for this City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7126.997s">[Collins]</a>: So my hope for you is that you feel as positive and as proud about your tenure<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7134.662s">[Collins]</a>: on city council as everybody else does, because it's a gift to leave us in such a position to be so much more effective and inclusive in our future work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7148.781s">[Collins]</a>: So thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7150.363s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for the sacrifices that you've made to be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7153.587s">[Collins]</a>: And I know that your life after city council will continue to be extremely full and busy doing incredible work on MIT campus, as well as taking care of the cutest two-year-old in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7166.113s">[Collins]</a>: But I, too, hope that we can lure you back in in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7169.994s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Nicole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=22.606s">[Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2722.236s">[Collins]</a>: Not a question, but I just wanted to thank you, pardon me, again for speaking to us about this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2728.001s">[Collins]</a>: I know it, I think it speaks to the need for, you know, I know it's an ever-evolving project too, because protocols around private ways have been shifting for such a long time and there's been kind of a systemic lack of clarity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2741.712s">[Collins]</a>: It's not totally surprising that this comes up every six months or 12 months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2746.356s">[Collins]</a>: I think it's good that we're talking about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2749.835s">[Collins]</a>: options for getting the word out to more residents within our capacity, like a mailing or, I mean, even just, I agree, even a really simple webpage, I think, would help folks in our position who, you know, kind of have to dole out information about private ways to residents when it comes up multiple times a year to try to, you know, over the long term, get more people on the same page throughout the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2774.846s">[Collins]</a>: So it's great to have a conversation about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2776.507s">[Collins]</a>: I know that we're going to try to move the needle on that as we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2781.358s">[Collins]</a>: and I think it's to everybody's benefit, you know, to just be reminded of what we're working against here and the responsibilities that we have that govern that public funds overall and how unfortunately incredibly expensive it is to do what we really want to do, which is to, you know, have that full jurisdiction over all of the roads that all residents live on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2803.477s">[Collins]</a>: I think it's just helpful to get sobering as it may be, you know, and reminders of what a big task that is for the city to do comprehensively and what we need to do in interim steps to try to improve resident enjoyment and, you know, equal enjoyment of residential roads in the meantime as we try to keep our eye on the prize for what will it take to, you know, fully adopt private ways over the long term and what are the reasons for doing that and what can people do in the meantime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2833.284s">[Collins]</a>: I appreciate this conversation and for me it's helpful for communicating that to residents and I hope that it's helpful in our ongoing efforts to let residents know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=3027.407s">[Collins]</a>: I have a motion to receive and place on file and adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1581.468s">[Collins]</a>: Mr. Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1585.811s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1587.543s">[Collins]</a>: Amy, thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1588.604s">[Collins]</a>: I don't feel entitled to you sympathizing with anything that I have to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1592.325s">[Collins]</a>: You have every right to be upset.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1593.546s">[Collins]</a>: I just, I don't want you to get up here and put yourself out there and may not respond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1597.868s">[Collins]</a>: I just want to say, if you think that we're getting everything that we want, I feel like we're not getting anything that we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1606.593s">[Collins]</a>: I'm speaking from the heart here, person to person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1612.756s">[Collins]</a>: I want everybody in the city to get a raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1614.877s">[Collins]</a>: We're the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1617.099s">[Collins]</a>: cannot negotiate with unions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1619.379s">[Collins]</a>: We can't make appropriations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1620.74s">[Collins]</a>: It's why my drumbeat for the past three months has been about these charter amendments, which I hope that I would get a call from the mayor by today saying that she's something to the AG and she didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1629.221s">[Collins]</a>: That's why my persistent frustration has been with our lack of power during this budget process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1633.882s">[Collins]</a>: But it's not fair to me that your negotiations are not resolved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1640.103s">[Collins]</a>: It's not at all fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1641.783s">[Collins]</a>: The whole process of bargaining negotiations of the city, I think,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1646.576s">[Collins]</a>: Obviously unfair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1647.959s">[Collins]</a>: Not everybody should get the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1649.261s">[Collins]</a>: The people who are paid the least should get the most and it should go up from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1653.229s">[Collins]</a>: All that is to say, I don't want you to think, well, you can think whatever you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1658.285s">[Collins]</a>: But I want to put on the record, I don't think that what's happening is acceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1661.348s">[Collins]</a>: I am looking at a situation where so much of what we see is deeply, deeply, deeply unacceptable to me, deeply unacceptable and unfair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1667.613s">[Collins]</a>: And it makes me sad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1669.334s">[Collins]</a>: It makes me sad, but I am aware of the legal limits of my power.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1673.237s">[Collins]</a>: So when a paper comes before me to give some employees a raise, if I have the opportunity to say yes to a raise for some people, I'll say yes to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1680.383s">[Collins]</a>: And I'm going to wish with all my heart that I had the ability to transmit that raise to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1684.827s">[Collins]</a>: that have to negotiate for it and I am sorry that I can't do more materially for you and your union in this situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1757.779s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3903.697s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell and I thank my fellow colleagues for joining with me in this resolution and I want to thank everybody in Medford who reached out to us over the past couple days to advocate for making sure that the spirit of pride and the flag of pride and the celebration of pride is, you know, echoes ever more loudly from City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3923.774s">[Collins]</a>: It's important every month of the year to let it be known that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3927.796s">[Collins]</a>: people of all walks of life, especially people who are celebrating Pride Month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3931.659s">[Collins]</a>: We're glad you're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3932.559s">[Collins]</a>: We support you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3933.2s">[Collins]</a>: We want you to live your best and proudest life every month of the year, and that we here in the Medford city government, we're here to support you in that, and to let you know that you have allies behind this rail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3946.729s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8218.29s">[Collins]</a>: Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8221.112s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Rowe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8221.852s">[Collins]</a>: I appreciate the thorough presentation that we've gotten and appreciate the targeted questions from my fellow Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8228.396s">[Collins]</a>: I mostly just have a point of clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8231.237s">[Collins]</a>: All of the proposed traffic and pedestrian mitigation that we saw in the presentation, if this is approved, will all of those go forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8273.766s">[Collins]</a>: Great, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8274.787s">[Collins]</a>: I appreciate the thoroughness there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8276.509s">[Collins]</a>: I think it's always helpful to see sign off from the CDB, from department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8280.373s">[Collins]</a>: You know, to me, I think that this is something that I'm glad that we're starting the public hearing process about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8283.857s">[Collins]</a>: This is a large commercial space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8285.739s">[Collins]</a>: It's an underutilized part of the parking lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8287.601s">[Collins]</a>: I think it would be great to see another establishment here for residents to take advantage of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8291.885s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11000.194s">[Collins]</a>: The next motion will be to approve the site plan review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11003.015s">[Collins]</a>: Is my understanding correct that the CDB recommendations are attached to the site plan review?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11017.061s">[Collins]</a>: I'm sorry, my question was if the CD board recommendations are tied to the site plan review and do not apply if the vote gets less than five votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11027.266s">[Collins]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13429.34s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13429.66s">[Collins]</a>: It's a little hard to introduce words into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13434.79s">[Collins]</a>: climate, and I want to acknowledge that and I'm going to try to speak both my fellow counselors and to the residents who are watching and I think that's very two very different audiences so I just want to acknowledge that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13450.649s">[Collins]</a>: Here's my timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13452.349s">[Collins]</a>: I went to the administration in May, and I said, these are my priorities, and I don't think I can vote for a budget that doesn't have these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13461.091s">[Collins]</a>: I need an increase to the schools department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13463.952s">[Collins]</a>: I need more money for the libraries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13466.072s">[Collins]</a>: I need our zoning money back in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13468.373s">[Collins]</a>: I need to talk about the clerical union, and I need some guarantees that starting next year, the budget process is going to be better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13474.974s">[Collins]</a>: And at that time, I think pretty loudly, I said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13479.035s">[Collins]</a>: I need guarantees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13480.076s">[Collins]</a>: These are these charter amendments that the budget process is going to be better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13485.64s">[Collins]</a>: Next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13486.081s">[Collins]</a>: That was my bottom line because I found the council's role to be largely unmeaningful and I know that's especially hard to hear right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13496.709s">[Collins]</a>: But with this vote, I'm trying to put, and I hope that my fellow counselors can, you know, I don't feel entitled to understanding on this tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13505.728s">[Collins]</a>: But I hope that in time, we can all relate to the feeling of trying to put a desired outcome ahead of my feelings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13511.212s">[Collins]</a>: And in this case, I have tried to find the utility in being a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13519.226s">[Collins]</a>: protest vote on this budget, and I've seriously, seriously considered it because this budget does not meet my values in many ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13526.668s">[Collins]</a>: Even with the increased appropriation to the libraries and the schools and putting zoning money that we should have already had in there back in the budget, it still is not the budget that describes the Medford that we deserve to live in and that our residents deserve to live in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13539.972s">[Collins]</a>: But I just can't in good conscience say that me voting down this budget, being a vote against this budget, is going to be better for the people who live here<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13550.469s">[Collins]</a>: then not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13552.611s">[Collins]</a>: And I told the administration clearly, more clearly than is comfortable for me as a person, I cannot vote for this budget knowing that the line item is not going to reflect the values that I have, unless we have an assurance that with this budget comes a better budget process next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13566.562s">[Collins]</a>: And it's less than I wanted, but it's a role for the council that I don't believe we would have had otherwise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13574.349s">[Collins]</a>: And it reflects investments in long-term budget planning that I don't think we would have had otherwise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13578.812s">[Collins]</a>: And I can say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13580.953s">[Collins]</a>: you know, to residents who probably heard me over the past three weeks saying, I can't vote for this budget if we don't have an assurance that the council, that the residents get to vote on the council's ability to make appropriations starting next year through a charter amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13596.742s">[Collins]</a>: I hope that this, you know, that process is going to continue for me as one counselor, that process has to continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13603.245s">[Collins]</a>: We have to put that, we have to put that to the voters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13607.787s">[Collins]</a>: In this case, I think that this is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13611.536s">[Collins]</a>: My vote is about trying to make the best of a situation that I can't celebrate, that I can't feel good about, but I'm trying to do the best that I can with what's in front of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13619.721s">[Collins]</a>: So that's the context for my vote tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13621.962s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13622.643s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15911.486s">[Collins]</a>: No, I'm actually just waiting to be heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15913.007s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15914.701s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15917.742s">[Collins]</a>: I think I've made it clear that I know how I'm voting, even though this is a very difficult decision, and I think that we have a, I know that not all my fellow councillors feel the same way, and you're entitled to feel derisive of that, and I don't regret you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15932.447s">[Collins]</a>: And I hope you can understand that I'm coming at this from my own sense as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15937.669s">[Collins]</a>: And just to reiterate before I motion to approve,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15944.687s">[Collins]</a>: you know, this is a difficult decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15947.088s">[Collins]</a>: And when we talk about an individual fiscal year budget, I think it is hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15951.449s">[Collins]</a>: We can't not think about all of the budgets after that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15956.31s">[Collins]</a>: It's hard not to think about long-term planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15957.891s">[Collins]</a>: It's hard for me personally as one constituent and as one councilor to not be overwhelmed by the scale of need for everything that both isn't being funded in this upcoming fiscal year budget and everything that is being planned for five, 10, 25, 50 years after that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15971.575s">[Collins]</a>: And in order to not be paralyzed by that and to make a decision,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15979.242s">[Collins]</a>: I have to think about what's within my jurisdiction, what can I make sure is in the budget, that we're better off having in the budget than wouldn't be, that isn't possibly on the table to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15988.071s">[Collins]</a>: So that's where I'm coming from, zoning, schools, library.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15995.277s">[Collins]</a>: And if there's a way for us to get an edge for a more meaningful participation in the budget process starting next year,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16002.731s">[Collins]</a>: I think that's more than we could have gotten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16003.992s">[Collins]</a>: Otherwise, am I satisfied?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16006.073s">[Collins]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16006.594s">[Collins]</a>: And if you want to tell a story about me being happy with this outcome, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16009.115s">[Collins]</a>: That's a story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16010.616s">[Collins]</a>: But that's where my vote is coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16012.197s">[Collins]</a>: I motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18039.991s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18042.032s">[Collins]</a>: Just to add my perspective on this, I'm ready to get this done tonight I sense that they're my fellow counselors, we don't, we don't have a super majority that's ready to get this done tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18053.762s">[Collins]</a>: But my reasoning is, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18058.889s">[Collins]</a>: I think that the idea of a stabilization fund is a good one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18060.85s">[Collins]</a>: I think that we probably all share that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18062.131s">[Collins]</a>: I don't think that's a minority opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18064.253s">[Collins]</a>: Looking back at the past few years and thinking ahead to do we want this online for fiscal year 24 or not, past few years, we haven't been fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18071.097s">[Collins]</a>: We haven't been fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18071.757s">[Collins]</a>: We've had a pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18073.118s">[Collins]</a>: Ask residents, we haven't been fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18075.46s">[Collins]</a>: What's different about next year is all this one-time funding is going away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18078.321s">[Collins]</a>: Do I think something catastrophic is going to happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18080.843s">[Collins]</a>: No, but if it did, I'd want to know that we did what we could to prepare.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18085.926s">[Collins]</a>: So we don't have to do it tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18089.09s">[Collins]</a>: I think we should do it by the end of this fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18091.092s">[Collins]</a>: If that means arranging for a committee of the whole on a special meeting next week, I'll make myself available, but I think that we should do it before the end of the fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18099.3s">[Collins]</a>: And we have had several months to think about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18101.482s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=14.619s">[Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=281.079s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell for putting this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=284.263s">[Collins]</a>: Everyone who knows Henry and Evelyn knows they truly have some of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=288.254s">[Collins]</a>: one of the most enthusiastic, energetic households in the city of Medford, and we're all very lucky that they choose to direct so much of their energies towards positive causes, typically, and for families in Medford, and I'm just so happy to see them getting some of the recognition that they deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=306.108s">[Collins]</a>: So thank you, Henry and Evelyn, for a really lifetime of positive contributions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1084.698s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1085.658s">[Collins]</a>: I appreciate, uh, counselor bears for putting this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1089.359s">[Collins]</a>: Um, I see this issue in action every time I try to drive to my house in South Medford from Wegmans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1096.162s">[Collins]</a>: Um, and it's this is a citywide issue of, you know, every apartment that I've lived in in South Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1102.584s">[Collins]</a>: There's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1103.576s">[Collins]</a>: one intersection that I look at 100 times a week where it seems to be a cut through street that inevitably has a daycare on that street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1109.96s">[Collins]</a>: And you see the people get impatient with the main thoroughfare and they use the cut through, they speed down it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1114.583s">[Collins]</a>: And it's, I agree it is a citywide issue and it's horrifying to see it every time because you're just waiting for something, you know, hair raising to happen and residents shouldn't have to live with that volume of high speed cut through traffic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1127.431s">[Collins]</a>: And I completely agree that the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1133.433s">[Collins]</a>: widespread nature of this issue throughout the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1135.414s">[Collins]</a>: I think it shines a light on how what we really need is the resources to support citywide approach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1142.899s">[Collins]</a>: I think a lot of the time with these issues, we can't control for every person who would speed if they got the opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1149.163s">[Collins]</a>: It's hard to devise a perfect<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1151.778s">[Collins]</a>: quick fix.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1152.498s">[Collins]</a>: Often those aren't as those aren't the solves that we want them to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1157.581s">[Collins]</a>: So in the absence of resources, you know, tomorrow to type of street redesign work that would really result in safer, appropriately speeded streets, you know, I'm hoping that our traffic and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1168.53s">[Collins]</a>: transportation departments can look at Willis Avenue with haste because, you know, it's been getting, you know, this seems like it's an acute issue right now in neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1176.918s">[Collins]</a>: Neighbors have been speaking up about it, and it's my hope that absent, you know, the resources for a redesign, at least the solutions that seem to be working best on Willis Avenue, when we get the chance to roll those out, we can be taking the best practices and hopefully adopting those for the other many, many problem areas across the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1193.673s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2278.728s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell, and I appreciate you sharing that update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2282.09s">[Collins]</a>: I also appreciate Councilor Scarpelli<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2285.234s">[Collins]</a>: bringing this forward, and I appreciate your efforts to get out ahead of the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2288.856s">[Collins]</a>: And I have a lot of concerns about this, and one of them is making sure that we're, since this issue is known, that we're being proactive with how we're communicating about it, and letting people know that this election is going to be, you know, has been above board, will be above board, and not sowing confusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2310.069s">[Collins]</a>: Because obviously,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2312.114s">[Collins]</a>: I think you said it very well, Councilor Scarpelli, that's the last thing that we need and it's unfortunate to have issues like this come up at this point in kind of the national mood around elections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2321.601s">[Collins]</a>: And so, using this platform to reassure the voters, I think is very productive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2328.186s">[Collins]</a>: I reached out to the Chief of Staff after seeing the update this afternoon with some questions, really glad to hear that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2335.351s">[Collins]</a>: Manager Ripley already responded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2338.733s">[Collins]</a>: to shed some light on the scale of the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2343.277s">[Collins]</a>: That was one of the questions I had, as well as, you know, when we say checks and balances, I think it's important for us to know exactly what those are so that we can, you know, again, be reassuring residents about, you know, exactly the how and the why of this not being an issue for election integrity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2358.711s">[Collins]</a>: So it's great to know, you know, the nuts and bolts for those who don't already know about how the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2364.085s">[Collins]</a>: state-assigned voter IDs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2365.766s">[Collins]</a>: I didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2366.326s">[Collins]</a>: It's great to know about that process so that we can all feel assured that, you know, extra ballots, if they're not disposed of before people get to City Hall, will not be counted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2376.93s">[Collins]</a>: I think that's really important to emphasize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2381.191s">[Collins]</a>: So it's unfortunate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2384.352s">[Collins]</a>: I think it's important that we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2386.496s">[Collins]</a>: you know, be transparent about the mistakes that have been made and be transparent about how exactly they're getting fixed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2391.499s">[Collins]</a>: And I'm glad that we are being properly hasty and responsible about fixing the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2398.682s">[Collins]</a>: And clearly, you know, making sure that this type of snafu does not keep happening in this office is something that I'm sure we'll all be, you know, very keen on communicating with that office about in the future, because this isn't what Medford needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1175.302s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, really appreciate the work of the planning staff that went into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1180.164s">[Collins]</a>: I know there's been a lot of back and forth with the state, so thank you for staying on it for many months to make sure that we can be in compliance and really appreciate the presentation as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1190.108s">[Collins]</a>: Emily, thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1191.549s">[Collins]</a>: I was hoping, could you speak a bit more about the maximum height with incentives piece, how that works, how those triggers kick in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1200.032s">[Collins]</a>: That's not feeling super intuitive to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1202.533s">[Collins]</a>: If you could walk us through that, I'd really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=407.964s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much Councilor Lazzaro, I apologize for holding up the start of this meeting I was running late and then my computer took 10 minutes to join the Wi-Fi, my apologies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=418.416s">[Collins]</a>: I'm joining the Zoom now, so I'll be able to screen share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=422.719s">[Collins]</a>: But just to recap, so the Overgrowth Ordinance was a proposal from, I believe, the previous term that was discussed with the Director of the Board of Health, as well as the Code Enforcement Officers from the Building Department, to deal with issues of accessibility on our public ways, such as sidewalk, and just to make sure that accessibility is maintained even when<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=448.716s">[Collins]</a>: yards and vegetation originating on private property is perhaps a little less closely tended to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=454.06s">[Collins]</a>: In a lot of cases that's totally fine, but in cases where it becomes a harborage for pests or insects or rodents or it grows so large that it affects people's ability to walk on the sidewalk, that's a problem and the city does need a mechanism to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=468.989s">[Collins]</a>: step in in that case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=470.871s">[Collins]</a>: And similarly, in how it affects the pest issue specifically, we were also requested to take another look at the rodent control ordinance by the Director of the Board of Health and some of the collaborators in City Administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=486.608s">[Collins]</a>: As has been a topic of many many conversations in the city council over the past few years than a city staff are diligently working on every week of the year, you know the rodent population in Medford as a neighboring communities is a really big issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=499.353s">[Collins]</a>: And as we see more development both from private developers and from public projects such as the MBTA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=504.515s">[Collins]</a>: displacing rodent populations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=506.657s">[Collins]</a>: We're getting more and more complaints, and I know that the Board of Health and the Health Department has been actively seeking to, you know, not just continue what they're already doing, but to be able to do more by way of prevention and mitigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=520.689s">[Collins]</a>: And obviously, controlling the rodent pest population in Medford is something that, if we have something that's working over here and something that's not working over here, then the problem isn't really getting better, because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=532.819s">[Collins]</a>: Rats can change leases a lot more easily than people can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=538.749s">[Collins]</a>: I've heard it said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=541.028s">[Collins]</a>: So at our first meeting on this topic, we discussed these two issues broadly with the board of health director and reviewed some preliminary ideas from mainly the board of health director, as well as code enforcement officers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=555.719s">[Collins]</a>: And we motioned out to see an initial draft of the overgrowth ordinance, which I had the clerk circulate yesterday and have shared with city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=565.887s">[Collins]</a>: And we also motioned to have some first drafts<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=571.092s">[Collins]</a>: updates made to the rodent control ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=573.193s">[Collins]</a>: So committee members have both of those documents before them this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=579.974s">[Collins]</a>: I have some feedback from city staff on these documents, and I know that Director O'Connor is also on the line as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=590.677s">[Collins]</a>: So I thought that tonight we could, in not too much time, we could<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=595.852s">[Collins]</a>: I know that councilors have reviewed these documents already, most likely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=599.295s">[Collins]</a>: I thought that we could quickly go over these drafts, flag any initial comments or questions that councilors do have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=607.641s">[Collins]</a>: Note any comments that Director O'Connor has for how to take these forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=612.124s">[Collins]</a>: I know that the building commissioner is also going to weigh in and then report out some planned updates or amendments to take these<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=622.881s">[Collins]</a>: further into our third meeting onto this topic based on the feedback that we heard tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=628.143s">[Collins]</a>: And then hopefully the next time we meet on this, we can have a pretty close to finalized document on both counts, having undergone a legal review as well that we can report out expeditiously, hopefully, if it is the will of this committee, and just put these new mechanisms on the books so that our city staff can implement them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=649.949s">[Collins]</a>: So I would be happy to turn it over to Director O'Connor for preliminary comments, and then I can just quickly walk through both documents, unless I'd be happy to turn the floor over to any of my fellow councilors who had questions or comments that they wanted to start out with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=941.945s">[Collins]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=943.266s">[Collins]</a>: If I may, yeah, it sounds like there's, I think there's a good argument for defining standing water as a term, much like we included a definition for bird feeder in the wildlife feeding ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=953.912s">[Collins]</a>: It's one of those things where if you know what it means, you don't need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=956.673s">[Collins]</a>: But if you don't, it's good to have it articulated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=982.828s">[Collins]</a>: What I would recommend is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=987.287s">[Collins]</a>: I'd like for in this meeting for us to end with a motion to send both the overgrowth ordinance and the updates to the rodent control ordinance, incorporating any amendments or planned amendments that we talk about in this meeting, for those amendments to be incorporated by myself and for them then to be sent to legal review before our next committee meeting on the topics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1006.283s">[Collins]</a>: Then when we see it again, it includes any updates that this committee would like to see, Director O'Connor or Commissioner Vandewall would like to see,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1014.229s">[Collins]</a>: and has undergone legal review with those changes, and then we'll review it again and report it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1019.151s">[Collins]</a>: That would be my proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1043.8s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1044.34s">[Collins]</a>: And I'll just note, because I know we discussed a lot about the purpose and intentions of this ordinance at our first meeting, but just to quickly revisit because we're not going line by line on this, because frankly, it's pretty straightforward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1057.045s">[Collins]</a>: I don't think that we need to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1058.826s">[Collins]</a>: Just to summarize as briefly as I can, what this document says is essentially<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1066.474s">[Collins]</a>: stating what we talked about as the goals being to give the city a mechanism to do enforcement when there is really problematic overgrowth that isn't being addressed on its own, defining the terms as needed, essentially saying overgrowth and harborage conditions that infringe on the public right of way or create nuisance conditions are prohibited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1087.332s">[Collins]</a>: making a clear exception that nothing in this section shall be interpreted as to prohibit gardening, landscaping, etc.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1094.676s">[Collins]</a>: And that enforcement is only necessary if it is determined to be the cause of a public's safety threat or nuisance by city officials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1102.6s">[Collins]</a>: It lays out who's enforcing it and penalties, and then it also does stipulate, as Director O'Connor suggested, that any penalty fines that are collected from enforcement of this ordinance will be deposited into the rodent control account to create revenue for doing rodent mitigation citywide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1121.613s">[Collins]</a>: And I know that this draft was promulgated after the agenda for this meeting went out, so I'll make sure that the clerk can attach it to the committee report for this meeting so that the public can view it ahead of our next committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1133.858s">[Collins]</a>: So with that, I would be happy to offer a motion to, I think the only thing left to do on this draft is to add in that we want a definition for standing water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1145.286s">[Collins]</a>: And then I will forward this along to legal review and also ask for legal input on some of the questions and highlighted parts in the draft that I sent around to counselors, which is mostly asking for their input on how to define certain terms the right way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1264.044s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1302.559s">[Collins]</a>: Yeah, if I may, I'd love to run quickly through the road and control ordinance updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1306.7s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1309.401s">[Collins]</a>: This one is a little more<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1312.543s">[Collins]</a>: I think it's equally straightforward, but it's a little more complicated because we're updating an existing ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1319.791s">[Collins]</a>: So I would be happy to just quickly summarize what I've added, or I could also quickly share my screen and just go through it, walk through it for our counselors and the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1332.464s">[Collins]</a>: And just, I just wanna,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1335.396s">[Collins]</a>: make sure that we run through it very quickly before we... I would also make a motion to incorporate any suggestions from councillors, continue to work with Director O'Connor to further tweak these updates and then submit this for legal review as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1351.089s">[Collins]</a>: So I defer to my councillors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1352.27s">[Collins]</a>: And if we would like to see it on the screen and go through it section by section, again, very quickly, or if a summary would be sufficient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1375.984s">[Collins]</a>: Great, can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1378.465s">[Collins]</a>: So again, this is along many of the same goals that we have already discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1383.887s">[Collins]</a>: And this is just a bit more for counselors to read through because it is updates to the existing ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1391.871s">[Collins]</a>: What I am suggesting here in incorporating some of the new goals that we've heard from Director O'Connor for this ordinance to give the health department more tools to do the enforcement that they need to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1406.08s">[Collins]</a>: In adding those, I think that it would be helpful for us to do some light reorganization of the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1411.164s">[Collins]</a>: So in the draft that I passed around to councilors prior to this meeting, which again, I will have the clerk attached to the committee report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1419.471s">[Collins]</a>: I think that up until now, the ordinance has mostly been about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1424.895s">[Collins]</a>: definitions and then permitting requirements for commercial properties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1430.379s">[Collins]</a>: Things that they have to do to get a permit as it pertains to rodent control, such as creating an integrated pest management plan, what has to be involved in that plan, what to do if they don't follow that plan, etc.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1442.328s">[Collins]</a>: A lot of what Director, or not a lot of, but some of the cornerstone of what Director O'Connor and I are trying to do in these updates is to put it all in the same ordinance, what we expect of commercial properties,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1454.838s">[Collins]</a>: what we expect of residential properties and what we expect of different types of residential properties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1459.281s">[Collins]</a>: So I'm suggesting that we add in those goals that we discussed the first meeting and then reorganize the ordinance so that it kind of sets our purpose and goals up top, talks about residential properties, and then it talks about commercial properties, including all of those rules around integrated pest management plans and whatnot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1476.732s">[Collins]</a>: So that draft does move around the sections a little bit and I propose that we just finalize the section numbers once everything is actually solidified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1487.27s">[Collins]</a>: I have kind of slotted in everything that Director O'Connor and I have spoken about with goals for the updated ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1494.191s">[Collins]</a>: There are some specific questions that I have on wording, language sufficiency, making sure that things are phrased in such a way that it'll be seamlessly enforceable for city officials, to make sure that things are phrased in such a way that it will be really easy for residents and property owners to understand what is expected of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1516.056s">[Collins]</a>: So that's the type of thing that I would just like to get another round of feedback from city staff on and also get feedback during the legal review on to make sure that this language is where it ought to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1532.067s">[Collins]</a>: This ordinance also,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1537.879s">[Collins]</a>: One thing, another specific thing that I'd be looking for input from legal counsel on is one goal of the health department was to have different levels of fines for noncompliance with the rodent control ordinance from residential buildings with less than three units versus residential buildings with more than three units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1558.785s">[Collins]</a>: I thought that there's kind of a fairness factor to having a heavier penalty for failure to do anything about rodent prevention and mitigation be levied upon<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1567.807s">[Collins]</a>: condo buildings, apartment buildings, buildings that are run more similarly to commercial buildings, as opposed to your single families, your duplexes, your triplexes, owner-occupied buildings, which I think makes a lot of sense, but I want some guidance to make sure that we're just phrasing that the right way since ordinance fines are governed by state law and how we may allocate those fines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1592.958s">[Collins]</a>: So I'm just calling that as a specific question that we put into legal counsel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1602.364s">[Collins]</a>: Just running through to see if there's anything else major that I want to make sure that counselors are aware of in this draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1612.048s">[Collins]</a>: And I don't believe that there are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1612.909s">[Collins]</a>: I think I have several more nitty gritty language questions that I'd like to forward along to legal counsel, which were included in the markup version that was circulated to counselors, and that will be attached to the committee report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1624.2s">[Collins]</a>: But apart from that, the other major change in this ordinance is that it specifically, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1630.306s">[Collins]</a>: It doubles down on the language for designating the rodent control account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1634.568s">[Collins]</a>: And this newly states that integrated pest management permit fees will be deposited into the rodent control account, which is new as of these updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1647.255s">[Collins]</a>: I think those are the major points that I wanted to flag, the most substantial points that I wanted to flag from the update, but I defer to Director O'Connor if there's anything that we've missed or anything that she'd like to add or underline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1779.003s">[Collins]</a>: What section was that, Director O'Connor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1800.763s">[Collins]</a>: Okay, got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1804.186s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1857.476s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Director O'Connor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1859.498s">[Collins]</a>: And I would just note one thing I neglected to mention that was also sent around to councillors is the fee schedule that describes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1872.381s">[Collins]</a>: that the fees attached to integrated pest management, fees for rodent control issues that are attached to street openings are referenced in this ordinance, but those are governed by Appendix A, which is our fee schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1886.952s">[Collins]</a>: So there are also proposed updates to that, which I will finalize, run by legal counsel, and attach to the updated version of this ordinance that comes before this committee at our next meeting date on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1903.407s">[Collins]</a>: So thank you so much for those comments, and I'd be, if there aren't any other comments or questions from councilors, I would make a motion to continue to incorporate feedback from Director O'Connor, run relevant sections of this update by the Commissioner of Public Works, Building Commissioner, run the section on composting by Director Hunt,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1929.696s">[Collins]</a>: and then get a legal review of the document, and also get some input from city staff on the updated fee schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1939.278s">[Collins]</a>: And then when all of those documents are complete, keep this in committee and meet again after the legal review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1958.137s">[Collins]</a>: Yeah, legal or just professional insight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1961.579s">[Collins]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1963.119s">[Collins]</a>: As with the rest of our updating of the fee schedule across various departments, just want to make sure that we're in line with what other communities are doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=2004.451s">[Collins]</a>: How about until legal review and all department review is complete?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=2087.626s">[Collins]</a>: Motion to keep the papers in committee and adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1172.22s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Chair Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1176.072s">[Collins]</a>: Yeah, I think that this is another one of this council's big projects that it would behoove us and the community to try to set an ambitious timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1186.038s">[Collins]</a>: There is so much to discuss here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1188.819s">[Collins]</a>: And I know that there's a ton of energy around reviewing the charter in the community right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1193.922s">[Collins]</a>: So I think that we should try to do what we can on the city council side to have the option stay open, to be putting changes to voters sooner instead of missing that window that only comes around once every several years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1207.09s">[Collins]</a>: So I think that we should approach that, yeah, ambitiously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1209.412s">[Collins]</a>: And as for kind of how to get started on that, I do think that it'd be worthwhile for us to have a meeting to kind of internally review and discuss the report before we start meeting with other stakeholders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1221.0s">[Collins]</a>: And I mean, I think there's a lot of reasons to do that, just because it's a lot to digest, there's a lot to discuss, it's all very consequential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1226.944s">[Collins]</a>: But also, I know that in this process, we're inevitably going to try and reconcile and find consensus<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1233.666s">[Collins]</a>: between perspectives that might be very different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1235.647s">[Collins]</a>: And I'd prefer for us to kind of have some chances to get ideas from different sources out on the table before we then start having those discussions between different types of stakeholders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1245.23s">[Collins]</a>: Because I think this is going to be a process where there are a lot of different ideas and different preferences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1250.692s">[Collins]</a>: And I think it would serve us well if we approach it from a standpoint of, I'm not having a different idea from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1258.826s">[Collins]</a>: you, whoever that is, in reaction to your idea or in opposition to that idea, but rather there are different approaches to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1264.49s">[Collins]</a>: Let's get them all out on the table, and then let's consider all of our approaches and just try to choose the best path forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=38.322s">[Collins]</a>: There will be a meeting of the Planning and Permanent Committee, October 9th, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=42.124s">[Collins]</a>: This meeting will take place at 6 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=44.766s">[Collins]</a>: in the City Council Chamber, second floor, Medford City Hall, 85 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford MA and via Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=50.569s">[Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=56.593s">[Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=63.277s">[Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=63.998s">[Collins]</a>: Five present, none absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=66.619s">[Collins]</a>: The meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=68.823s">[Collins]</a>: We are also joined by non-voting members of the committee, Councilor Tseng and Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=78.953s">[Collins]</a>: The action and discussion items for this committee are again paper 24-033, Zoning Ordinance Updates with the Innis Associates Team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=88.746s">[Collins]</a>: The meeting notice writes that we are going to discuss the green score proposal, discussion of housing definitions, and general discussion of updates to the zoning ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=96.51s">[Collins]</a>: We're actually not going to be discussing green score proposal tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=100.152s">[Collins]</a>: We've discussed that in previous meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=103.074s">[Collins]</a>: The zoning consultant is doing more work on that side of things before we bring it forward to this committee for another public discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=111.278s">[Collins]</a>: So that is one of many items that is in progress, but we won't be speaking about it this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=118.191s">[Collins]</a>: For tonight, we are going to focus the conversation on two main discussion points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=124.514s">[Collins]</a>: We're going to revisit the housing definitions that were first circulated during the week of September 11.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=133.078s">[Collins]</a>: I don't remember if that was the date of the meeting or the date that the meeting notice went out, but we have recirculated those housing definitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=140.622s">[Collins]</a>: And since we've discussed them before and counselors have had several weeks to review, formulate comments and questions,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=147.912s">[Collins]</a>: I'm hoping that that is a piece that we can consolidate all of our remaining questions, comments, requested subtractions, additions on, and get that to a condition where it's able to report out as part of the incoming package of updates that we've been working on for the past four to six weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=168.427s">[Collins]</a>: And just to finish summarizing the agenda for tonight,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=172.818s">[Collins]</a>: We are also going to discuss the zoning proposal for Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=179.062s">[Collins]</a>: We've gone over this in great detail in a couple meetings of this committee recently, and we're going to hear some, I think at our most recent meeting was when we reported out, sorry, at our most recent meeting, we approved some recommendations from the zoning consultant on how to move forward with zoning for Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=197.868s">[Collins]</a>: And I understand that there are some minor changes, suggestions, additions to what the council, what this committee approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=205.315s">[Collins]</a>: So we're going to review and discuss those this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=209.64s">[Collins]</a>: And I think we're still planning to have those back in this committee on October 23rd so that we can hopefully report them out and get them on the pipeline where they will then be reviewed by the Community Development Board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=220.911s">[Collins]</a>: So I am happy to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=222.662s">[Collins]</a>: turn it over to my fellow counselors if they have any initial questions, and then to turn it over to our housing consultant to lead the discussion on the housing definitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=237.327s">[Collins]</a>: Any comments or questions from counselors to lead us off today?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=242.989s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=243.329s">[Collins]</a>: In that case, thank you so much to NS Associates for being here with us once again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=249.611s">[Collins]</a>: And Paola, I assume that we're going to be hearing from you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=252.013s">[Collins]</a>: These are, again, these are housing definitions that we have seen before and reviewed before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=257.538s">[Collins]</a>: So if members of the public are interested in the presentation on the housing definitions, that can be found in recordings of our previous committee meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=264.564s">[Collins]</a>: Paola, if you want to give us the kind of 30,000 foot overview of what we're looking at here and why these are so important to put into our updated zoning, that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=274.052s">[Collins]</a>: And then we'll move on to comment from councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=615.201s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=616.321s">[Collins]</a>: I'll recognize Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=920.801s">[Collins]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=922.779s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=923.74s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=925.1s">[Collins]</a>: Councilor Leming?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1272.918s">[Collins]</a>: If I may, and to follow up on the point that Director Hunt was making about sort of what's important for this discussion on definitions in terms of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1284.298s">[Collins]</a>: why we're updating the definitions before we update more of our zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1287.742s">[Collins]</a>: And thinking about essentially like what are the semantic tools that we're giving ourselves with which to say we want this here, we don't want this here, we'd prefer this not here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1297.111s">[Collins]</a>: I think the point about the current Bedford dormitory definition is well taken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1301.496s">[Collins]</a>: I mean, I would be amenable to perhaps<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1305.373s">[Collins]</a>: If we want to make sure that we have a higher degree of control over where dormitories are being proposed and built, I think that we could strike the, we could have a just say building designed for residents, for students or staff if we want to have more control over where residences explicitly for student populations are within our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1325.551s">[Collins]</a>: I don't think that this is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1327.261s">[Collins]</a>: I think there's some definitions that we're going to consider right now and over the next few months that are like critical so that we can do other things on our kind of slate of zoning goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1336.346s">[Collins]</a>: I don't know that this is one of them, but I think that that kind of change is in line with essentially what we're hoping to do with the definition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1345.431s">[Collins]</a>: So I would just offer that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1346.331s">[Collins]</a>: I can't make motions as the chair, but that makes sense to me unless somebody points out what I'm missing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1354.656s">[Collins]</a>: And then it sounded to me like there were some<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1356.778s">[Collins]</a>: some good ideas for updating the proposed definitions for co-living and co-housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1451.771s">[Collins]</a>: Yeah, I find that persuasive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1453.071s">[Collins]</a>: And reading over the Cambridge definition, I do think that that kind of captures the intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1458.273s">[Collins]</a>: Personally, I would be amenable to adopting the Cambridge definition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1461.641s">[Collins]</a>: replace our current one along with the other updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1580.346s">[Collins]</a>: I think that, um, I think it's fine to either motion things individually or to have the motion at the end of this meeting be to incorporate the feedback promulgated in the meeting and keep the paper in committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1589.992s">[Collins]</a>: So I think we, if it's, it's, if it's helpful to have the clerk compile them line by line, um, just means that I don't have to take notes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1597.296s">[Collins]</a>: So I think either way is okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1599.678s">[Collins]</a>: Or it doesn't mean I have to take as scrupulous notes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1635.089s">[Collins]</a>: it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1636.07s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1636.37s">[Collins]</a>: Is there a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1639.952s">[Collins]</a>: Is there a second on the motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1641.914s">[Collins]</a>: Great, seconded by Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1646.977s">[Collins]</a>: If there are not any other glaring questions or comments on the housing definitions, or are there any other glaring comments or questions on the definitions, Councilor Callahan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1676.925s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Halihan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1678.667s">[Collins]</a>: It's my understanding that once we incorporate the feedback that we just talked about on co-living, co-housing and the dormitories definition,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1687.691s">[Collins]</a>: The rest of these I think are in pretty good shape.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1689.312s">[Collins]</a>: We've discussed this before, so I think the next time we see this, it'll be in the condition that we could take a vote to report it out of committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1695.914s">[Collins]</a>: Emily Pella, I see nodding heads on Zoom, excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1700.516s">[Collins]</a>: And we will have, we will follow up with the exact language of the updates to co-living, co-housing and dormitories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1710.34s">[Collins]</a>: Great, thank you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1712.021s">[Collins]</a>: Let's move on to our discussion of the zoning proposal for Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1718.212s">[Collins]</a>: And just to recap, at our last committee meeting where we discussed the Mystic Ab Zoning Proposal, we looked at a lot of excellent visuals created by NS Associates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1730.138s">[Collins]</a>: Councilors were shown kind of two versions of a zoning proposal that were based on the many meetings we've had to discuss Mystic Ab and also incorporated the many documents that kind of encapsulate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1743.217s">[Collins]</a>: we did receive some City constituent counselor feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1746.639s">[Collins]</a>: On what we want to see from Mr. Gaff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1748.761s">[Collins]</a>: Um that kind of had a mildly different interplay between these two versions expressing different ways that mixed use zones and commercial areas could fit together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1761.309s">[Collins]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1762.329s">[Collins]</a>: We reported out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1763.41s">[Collins]</a>: We're sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1764.07s">[Collins]</a>: I keep saying reported out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1764.931s">[Collins]</a>: We approved one of them to go<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1773.226s">[Collins]</a>: in conversation since that meeting, which I think was in the last week of September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1777.608s">[Collins]</a>: I think it was the September 25th meeting, but I should fact check that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1783.491s">[Collins]</a>: Between then and now, I think that city staff and its associates have discussed that draft map, and there are some minor changes to the plan that the committee approved that they wanted to brief the committee on before it comes back on the 23rd in a position that we can take a vote to report it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1802.034s">[Collins]</a>: So I'm happy to turn it over to Director Cohn if you want to start out or just kick it over to Emily and Paola to give us that update on what's changed since we saw it last.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2043.539s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2044.139s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for that update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2045.32s">[Collins]</a>: And yeah, just to recenter on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2047.142s">[Collins]</a>: So what's changed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2052.162s">[Collins]</a>: Let me get my cardinal directions right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2053.642s">[Collins]</a>: That blue zigzag, that was the recommendation of this committee at our last meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2058.343s">[Collins]</a>: The change that's being proposed newly as of this meeting is the section towards the south side that's split between pink and purple, which is mixed-use three and commercial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2068.126s">[Collins]</a>: The new recommendation is to have commercial on that side at all as opposed to mixed-use three all the way down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2073.267s">[Collins]</a>: President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2329.816s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2330.496s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2331.076s">[Collins]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2332.277s">[Collins]</a>: Sorry, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2332.958s">[Collins]</a>: But yeah, thank you for entertaining this exception.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2334.659s">[Collins]</a>: I think this makes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2481.104s">[Collins]</a>: What about Planner Evans?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2524.126s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2524.586s">[Collins]</a>: Do we want to entertain a change to this person as well?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2636.667s">[Collins]</a>: Councilor Halihan, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2637.448s">[Collins]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2791.503s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2792.163s">[Collins]</a>: So interesting discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2796.129s">[Collins]</a>: as chair all the way to motion if we're going to propose a further tweak to that zone or leave as is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2803.791s">[Collins]</a>: But I do want to hasten us to what I believe is the last piece of our discussion for the Mystic Abzoning proposal tonight before it goes back to Innis Associates for, you know, to wrap up all of these final tweaks and comments so that we can take a vote to report it out on October 23rd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2823.135s">[Collins]</a>: And that is to consider quickly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2825.828s">[Collins]</a>: the dimensional table, table of uses, because that informs when we're talking about these zones, what actually will be done and performed within them in all of these zones that we're just describing in abstract terms right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2841.043s">[Collins]</a>: Paola, remind me, was this one of the materials that we sent around to the committee on Friday, or is this a later breaking document?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2854.096s">[Collins]</a>: Oh, okay, excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2855.757s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2857.637s">[Collins]</a>: Sorry, I couldn't remember off the top of my head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2858.838s">[Collins]</a>: It's been a long day, but that's great, as intended, circulated to councillors prior to the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2864.339s">[Collins]</a>: So I'd like to ask my fellow committee members, you know, to lead off the discussion if there are any aspects of the proposed dimensionals, aspects of the table of uses that we'd like to flag for question or comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2920.765s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2921.966s">[Collins]</a>: Go ahead, Professor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3134.568s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Barras, Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3135.85s">[Collins]</a>: Oh, sorry, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3207.508s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3343.983s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3344.543s">[Collins]</a>: President Burris.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3511.714s">[Collins]</a>: So the suggestion would be rather than instituting a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3515.478s">[Collins]</a>: rather than instituting no minimums for commercial to state a maximum ground floor height in commercial?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3547.694s">[Collins]</a>: I'm amenable to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3548.514s">[Collins]</a>: I think I'm also, I understand the need to keep some industry, the possibility of industrial open, certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3555.217s">[Collins]</a>: I also, you know, see that in the context of trying to develop new zoning that will entice, you know, kind of making maximum use of this corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3566.361s">[Collins]</a>: So I'm also amenable to the kind of suggestion of one story by special permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3576.445s">[Collins]</a>: But it sounds like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3580.689s">[Collins]</a>: I feel like I'm hearing comfort with the concept of a minimum height of one story in commercial with that max ground floor height set at 30 feet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3682.509s">[Collins]</a>: I do see a hand on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3683.47s">[Collins]</a>: We will take public participation soon when we finish up with this item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3687.792s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3917.678s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3920.139s">[Collins]</a>: If I'm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3921.62s">[Collins]</a>: One second, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3923.04s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3941.263s">[Collins]</a>: Is there a second on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3942.965s">[Collins]</a>: Is there a second on the motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3945.167s">[Collins]</a>: And it's just being decided to end it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3946.568s">[Collins]</a>: Cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3946.888s">[Collins]</a>: Yeah, we're just adding it to the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3948.99s">[Collins]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3949.29s">[Collins]</a>: I'll recognize you, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4032.869s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4033.489s">[Collins]</a>: Yeah, I think that there's been a lot of good kind of guiding questions floated by counselors and city staff in this discussion that should guide us as city staff and the zoning consultant kind of more deeply consider<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4051.345s">[Collins]</a>: the table of uses for MX3 and commercial so that we, you know, kind of the same questions that we have been talking about, but just getting to a more granular place as we finalize this, which is, you know, how do we make sure that our zoning makes it harder for people to do things here that we really don't want them to do, that we don't want Mystic App being used for anymore, while making it accessible for the types of uses that we really do want to be cultivating and attracting, while<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4078.294s">[Collins]</a>: having a coherent enough, comfortable enough experience for people who do business along the stick out and the residents nearby.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4107.674s">[Collins]</a>: Paola or Emily, has there been a co-working definition added to the table of uses or can we do that for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4177.759s">[Collins]</a>: Go ahead, Councilor Calderon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4381.585s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Cullohan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4387.591s">[Collins]</a>: Are there any further comments or questions that we want to raise for NS Associates city staff on the table of uses and definitions before we close out discussion of this topic?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4405.156s">[Collins]</a>: Seeing none, to recap, I think that- If I may?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4567.895s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Sal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4570.396s">[Collins]</a>: It's nice to be able to infuse these conversations about the nitty gritty and with the visioning that guides what we're trying to do here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4577.28s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4579.701s">[Collins]</a>: To summarize, coming out of this meeting, we are incorporating some updates to the housing definitions around co-living, co-housing, and dormitory on the Mystic Ave zoning proposal, which is nearing completion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4597.134s">[Collins]</a>: Um, we have some minor additional adjustments to, um, the land use map, as we discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4605.919s">[Collins]</a>: Um, a couple specific motions were made detailing those requested changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4611.442s">[Collins]</a>: Um, and in addition, I think we have a directive to city staff and the zoning consultant to work together, um, to, on a very granular level, consider<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4623.544s">[Collins]</a>: the table of uses and dimensionals specifically around next use three commercial and how they will affect the overall character and coherence of Mystic app.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4633.409s">[Collins]</a>: Unless there are any further questions or motions, I would entertain a motion to put this forward and keep the paper in committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4662.871s">[Collins]</a>: I see a hand raise on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4663.972s">[Collins]</a>: Gaston, I'll unmute you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4665.413s">[Collins]</a>: Please go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4665.974s">[Collins]</a>: Please state your name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4667.435s">[Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4668.176s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for waiting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4748.838s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4748.998s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Gaston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4750.219s">[Collins]</a>: Yeah, I think that point about where we want flexibility is really relevant here and very well taken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4757.304s">[Collins]</a>: President Bears?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4758.845s">[Collins]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4772.073s">[Collins]</a>: Great, on the motion by President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4774.634s">[Collins]</a>: And I understand this is no longer a hybrid meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4778.356s">[Collins]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4779.657s">[Collins]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4780.478s">[Collins]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4782.079s">[Collins]</a>: Great, thank you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4783.479s">[Collins]</a>: And thank you, city staff and associates for being with us and guiding us as usual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4788.823s">[Collins]</a>: Meeting adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=955.624s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Barras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=956.325s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being with us here tonight and for all the legwork that you've been doing to get the FY 25 estimated valuations online months earlier than you otherwise would.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=965.791s">[Collins]</a>: Really appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=966.671s">[Collins]</a>: And I appreciate that it helps folks get a clearer picture of what precisely their bills might look like in the future based on various<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=977.478s">[Collins]</a>: how the votes go in various directions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=979.52s">[Collins]</a>: So just to make sure that I understand the information that's available, and it would be, is it on the Assessor's Department page or the Finance Department page on the city website?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1010.909s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1011.19s">[Collins]</a>: So up until today, people can call your office or look on the assessor's department website webpage and find the webpage is going to be dependent on like, I'm going to try to get it up this week, but like, it's just however fast we can do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1025.423s">[Collins]</a>: But<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1026.26s">[Collins]</a>: We have the FY 24 based calculations and now you're expediting getting the FY 25 based valuations so that people can have even more clarity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1036.485s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1036.765s">[Collins]</a>: Well, thank you so much for updating that ahead of schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1038.686s">[Collins]</a>: Appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1823.786s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1824.529s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1828.319s">[Collins]</a>: I want to add a disclaimer that I obviously sitting behind this rail on this date, I'm not a school committee member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1834.8s">[Collins]</a>: I don't have that level of granular knowledge of the school department and the school department makes its own budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1840.641s">[Collins]</a>: The city council does not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1842.102s">[Collins]</a>: That being said, I have discussed this matter extensively with people in the community, with people involved in the schools, with school committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1852.524s">[Collins]</a>: I understand that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1854.224s">[Collins]</a>: you know, what we stand to lose if these questions do not pass includes, you know, some of the stuff that people involved in the schools may remember from when we had to cut the school's budget during the pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1867.679s">[Collins]</a>: And that includes eliminating positions, including teachers, nurses, behavioral specialists, literary coaches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1875.568s">[Collins]</a>: We lose the opportunity to add programming within the schools that supplement the curriculum that is state mandated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1883.713s">[Collins]</a>: So, some programming that is really beloved by students and their families, such as arts and musical curricula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1892.297s">[Collins]</a>: We lose the opportunity to augment the student experience with those types of classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1897.44s">[Collins]</a>: We lose the opportunity to augment the student experience with more people in supportive roles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1905.625s">[Collins]</a>: such as therapists, nurses, people outside of the classroom who are nevertheless there to make sure that students can thrive in our schools and achieve the best learning that they can?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1919.275s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1921.256s">[Collins]</a>: These two questions combined also limit our ability to offer competitive and living wages to the many, many people who work in our schools and offer<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1931.823s">[Collins]</a>: students the experience that they really deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1935.005s">[Collins]</a>: We know that we need to be offering living wages to our teachers and paras and all school staff because it's the right thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1940.446s">[Collins]</a>: We also know that we need to be able to do that in order to keep these people in our school system so that our students are served in the way that they deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1949.118s">[Collins]</a>: This will also have impacts on building maintenance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3181.923s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3183.224s">[Collins]</a>: I appreciate the discussion from my fellow councilors on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3186.525s">[Collins]</a>: I won't go into the topic of new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3189.146s">[Collins]</a>: My fellow councilors have covered that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3190.947s">[Collins]</a>: We are very optimistic about how the council's current work on zoning and permitting, which we've been keeping up for two terms, will continue to accelerate new growth and augment the city's operating budget to the greatest extent possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3204.334s">[Collins]</a>: I do just want to note that on the issue of free cash, just to, I think,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3208.359s">[Collins]</a>: Different ways of framing the issue are helpful for me, maybe for other people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3215.22s">[Collins]</a>: It's no secret that we accrued free cash over several years, and that was not dispersed into savings accounts where it could be used and spent on capital expenditures because our city, unlike almost every other city and town in Massachusetts, before this year did not have any stabilization accounts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3233.504s">[Collins]</a>: Now we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3234.204s">[Collins]</a>: That means that that money can go to the purposes that I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3237.225s">[Collins]</a>: City staff and many residents really wanted it to be going to expected it to be going to all along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3242.548s">[Collins]</a>: Things like capital expenses and also repairing our infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3246.49s">[Collins]</a>: Putting aside some of that money that's already been allocated to things that people can see out on the street, helping our DPW and other departments improve life and do basic maintenance in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3255.474s">[Collins]</a>: Even if you say, okay, let's forget some of those capital expenditures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3258.476s">[Collins]</a>: Let's pretend that we still have $25 million in free cash, just using an easy number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3263.29s">[Collins]</a>: That's one-eighth of the city's annual operating budget, which means, you know, if it's one-eighth, you can understand how quickly we would run through that if we were using that as things to plug the hole in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3273.975s">[Collins]</a>: And I do want to emphasize that doesn't include any capital expenses whatsoever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3279.618s">[Collins]</a>: Going back to the resident's question on why now, I think it comes down to we know that free cash is not sustainable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3287.581s">[Collins]</a>: We know that we're already full steam on new growth, but we need more and better funding and services for our residents now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3294.686s">[Collins]</a>: And I think the question is, do we want to punish residents and students for past shortcomings by failing to invest now, or do we want to take this opportunity to start making Medford better for all residents and students in the public schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3427.807s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3429.108s">[Collins]</a>: The financial task force was a group explicitly made up of elected to consider the question of what we would put before our elected bodies to deal with solutions around this problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3441.258s">[Collins]</a>: However, I feel really comfortable in saying that all of the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3445.622s">[Collins]</a>: above types of people, city staff, members of the community, were consulted in various ways, formally and informally, throughout this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3454.393s">[Collins]</a>: Some that people talked to, some that members of the financial task force talked to while we were considering these matters that were discussed in our meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3462.183s">[Collins]</a>: Some of that were explicitly consulted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3464.705s">[Collins]</a>: And others that have just been part of this greater conversation around what should we do with about what should we do about chronic underfunding in Medford over the course of months and months and years and years of challenges that have led up to this year in which we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3479.477s">[Collins]</a>: Working together to try to solve these issues once and for all, instead of having budget season after budget season, where the school budget is essentially held hostage by our inability to raise enough money to add to provide the services that residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3494.785s">[Collins]</a>: students and teachers expect and deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3497.567s">[Collins]</a>: And I also just want to underline, again, that these ballot questions, every single resident, every single voter in Medford, whether you're a parent, a teacher, a union member, somebody who works for the city, who also lives in the city, you get to use your voice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3511.436s">[Collins]</a>: You get to cast your vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3512.557s">[Collins]</a>: You can vote yes on all three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3513.738s">[Collins]</a>: You can vote no on all three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3515.019s">[Collins]</a>: You can choose which ones you feel comfortable voting yes and voting no on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3518.141s">[Collins]</a>: You are a part of this conversation because every single person who votes gets a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3523.324s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4089.914s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4091.856s">[Collins]</a>: Again, speaking as a member of the financial task force, I want to try to put this a different way because maybe I wasn't, I want to try putting this differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4101.403s">[Collins]</a>: The financial task force, this group of electeds, tasked with- And the chief of staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4110.911s">[Collins]</a>: As the mayor's staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4114.189s">[Collins]</a>: If I had a staff person, I probably want them with me taking notes as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4120.114s">[Collins]</a>: Our assignment was to create a proposal for a political solution to a community-wide problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4126.18s">[Collins]</a>: And that is why this task force was made up of electeds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4129.242s">[Collins]</a>: I think folks who are asking the question, rightfully so, of why did you come up with what you came up with should<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4139.801s">[Collins]</a>: look to the hours and hours of tape that we have the public meetings that we've had in this chambers between the city council and the school committee where we discussed that question in terms of why seven and a half million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4154.619s">[Collins]</a>: Gosh, there's a lot of school committee meetings enumerating exactly what we cut in various different budget scenarios to back up why we think that this is the number that is at the nexus of what we know that we need and what we think that we can reasonably ask of the residents to strike that sweet spot between<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4171.044s">[Collins]</a>: trying to maintain an equitable and deserved school experience for Medford Public School students with something that the community can be comfortable with and can say yes to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4182.393s">[Collins]</a>: It is our job as people who run for offices, instead of going to planning school and trying to get a job in City Hall, to try to come up with, for lack of a better word, political solutions to real life community-wide problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4195.804s">[Collins]</a>: That is what the task force sought to do, and now everybody gets the chance to vote on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5033.681s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5035.001s">[Collins]</a>: Not to put too fine a point on it, but I think we've all acknowledged behind the rail<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5040.879s">[Collins]</a>: that we have problems this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5042.6s">[Collins]</a>: And let's say hypothetically that our free cash was not already allocated to capital funds that our department heads have been advocating for in many cases for years and years and years and being pushed off because we didn't have the money to allocate towards those capital expenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5057.472s">[Collins]</a>: And now we're finally able to start chipping away at that very, very long list of projects on our capital improvement plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5064.338s">[Collins]</a>: Let's just put aside that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5067.637s">[Collins]</a>: and say, hypothetically, what if we still had unallocated free cash that we could use on an operating budget, which we don't because it's allocated to capital projects?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5077.041s">[Collins]</a>: I think that there's a shared acknowledgment behind this rail that that does put us back at square one, and we have to revisit this conversation again in May for fiscal 26 with no better solutions than we do now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5089.566s">[Collins]</a>: So I've asked myself,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5091.852s">[Collins]</a>: What would I cut if we then approaching fiscal 26 with no better off because new growth takes five to 10 years to really flourish into that robustly improved commercial tax base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5105.555s">[Collins]</a>: And we haven't taken advantage of accelerating our tax levy so that we can try to get in fighting distance of where inflation has put us as a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5118.092s">[Collins]</a>: And now we don't have the cash reserves that again are hypothetical at this point because we already know that we need them for capital expenses and we have to balance the budget for fiscal 26.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5127.715s">[Collins]</a>: What would I cut?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5130.016s">[Collins]</a>: There's nothing to cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5131.176s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5310.994s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5311.274s">[Collins]</a>: I'm sure that my fellow councilors will add to this list, but just to reference some of the data points that have been coming up multiple times in this meeting in particular, I'd guide you to the pavement management plan that was put out by the DPW some years ago, and that's a few years out of date now, but it details the- It was actually updated last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5328.939s">[Collins]</a>: Oh, nevermind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5329.819s">[Collins]</a>: Updated last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5331.219s">[Collins]</a>: That details the $200 million in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5337.401s">[Collins]</a>: backlog of road repairs that are needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5340.123s">[Collins]</a>: For more detail on the needs in the schools, I would direct you to really any of the budget cycles, the recent budget cycles, school committee meetings, FY23 or FY24, which I think go into the level of detail that folks are really curious about when it comes to what is at stake, what actually does go on the chopping block each year, and that is brought back depending on ESSER funding, when that was available, or other one-time funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5362.429s">[Collins]</a>: And I think that the capital improvement plan is also a really interesting augment to those operating costs that show how much money really needs to be funded to on the infrastructural and maintenance side that we are really waiting to have the funding for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7486.193s">[Collins]</a>: Mine is related to a different part of the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7592.861s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, and just quickly to follow up on that, I'll note that, again, to echo what President Behr said, it's not within the purview of this council to have any input on the design of the fire headquarters, but I will note for folks who might be interested, on the city website under the fire department webpage, there are links to six of the concept plans that were published this year, which I think is interesting for folks, for residents who want a little bit more detail, because it actually enumerates what's different in each design from the one preceding it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7910.986s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7912.047s">[Collins]</a>: Um, again, as a city council member, not involved in the school's department budgeting process, but I would just say, considering these questions,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7923.373s">[Collins]</a>: thinking about the motives behind them in terms of the motives for community, the motives politically for putting these forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7931.682s">[Collins]</a>: It's hard for me to imagine, even putting on my cynical hat, what our gain could possibly be in putting forward<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7940.677s">[Collins]</a>: a question that asks residents to pay more in taxes to then spend it on spurious things in the schools department when we know, because we hear from residents all the time, all year long in school department meetings, in school committee meetings and in city council meetings, the adverse effects on students and teachers and staff because of underfunding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7962.072s">[Collins]</a>: And the ways that we want to see the school experience be better for students that we can't yet afford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7968.415s">[Collins]</a>: It's it's hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7969.735s">[Collins]</a>: We have no motivation to raise this money and then spend it on things that are not the things that the community has already been in some cases really begging city leadership to spend it on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7984.265s">[Collins]</a>: I'm not involved in the weeds of the school's department budgeting process the way that the school committee is in the way that the school's department is, but there is, it's just impossible for me to imagine a scenario where this money will be spent on 30 seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8001.633s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8004.821s">[Collins]</a>: The goal of doing this very difficult thing, which indeed is causing a lot of difficult conversations in the community, is to improve life for Medford public school students, life and conditions for Medford residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8018.344s">[Collins]</a>: It would be... 10 seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8021.585s">[Collins]</a>: It would be bizarre for us to spend it away on various things that weren't directly related to improving quality of life for residents and students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8681.817s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8684.56s">[Collins]</a>: Obviously, there's been a lot said in this Q&A forum, and I just think that with everything else that we've been hearing, I also want to put on the record that we talked about the costs if the overrides should pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8697.174s">[Collins]</a>: The assessor gave a great presentation earlier about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8700.356s">[Collins]</a>: how costs will go up regardless, how costs will go up if seven passes, how costs will go up if both pass, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8708.463s">[Collins]</a>: And that's significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8709.824s">[Collins]</a>: I think that is significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8710.704s">[Collins]</a>: I think that people should take it seriously and decide how they feel about it and if they think that they can afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8715.108s">[Collins]</a>: And what if any exemptions apply to them and how those will work with them and call the assessor if they have questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8720.032s">[Collins]</a>: I also think that what also deserves a serious and honest discussion is how households and individuals end up paying out of pocket if we continue to not fund our public sector, if we continue to let our roads and sidewalks get worse and worse and worse, which is something to be taken seriously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8740.018s">[Collins]</a>: It is a safety issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8741.519s">[Collins]</a>: It is an accessibility issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8743.179s">[Collins]</a>: If we continue to let our schools get worse and keep missing every opportunity to make them get better,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8753.203s">[Collins]</a>: I think it is frankly condescending to build this discussion as nothing more than trying to scare people into voting a certain way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8764.205s">[Collins]</a>: For the people who think, wow, what if the schools are no longer an environment where my student can learn or thrive?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8771.246s">[Collins]</a>: I cannot pay for a tutor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8773.187s">[Collins]</a>: I cannot pay for five-day school tuition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8775.467s">[Collins]</a>: I am concerned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8778.388s">[Collins]</a>: We should not be belittling that emotion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8780.575s">[Collins]</a>: We should not be belittling people who are having to pay out of pocket every year for car repairs, because we can't take care of the most basic thing in our city in a way that makes it not quite so obvious when you drive from Winchester into Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8797.645s">[Collins]</a>: The format of this discussion was supposed to be a Q&A session where residents can ask questions and counselors could give answers to the best of their ability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8805.53s">[Collins]</a>: I am pretty disappointed that it's turned into an event where certain counselors are telling residents not how they should vote, but how they should feel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9307.898s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9308.258s">[Collins]</a>: I'll be quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9309.139s">[Collins]</a>: Just a quick point of information because I know it's been said a few times tonight that the $500,000 would quote, fix the roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9316.463s">[Collins]</a>: I think that as the published pavement management plan on the city website establishes that we have $200 million in a backlog of road repairs in the city, I think we're all very aware<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9327.529s">[Collins]</a>: that half a million dollars is not going to fix the roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9330.79s">[Collins]</a>: As it says in the text of the question, what this would do is enable the DPW to establish, as it reads, additional staff for road and sidewalk infrastructure repair, which relates to the in-house hot top crew that Councilor Scarpelli has been advocating for for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9344.216s">[Collins]</a>: So Councilor, I'm sad to hear that you've reversed your position on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9902.296s">[Collins]</a>: No, I mean, if you have more detail to add on the Cambridge Fire Station example, I just think that we covered this question earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10513.008s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10513.408s">[Collins]</a>: Just in brief, obviously we know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10517.418s">[Collins]</a>: That's really tough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10518.199s">[Collins]</a>: And we know that the student experience coming out of the pandemic when so much critical in classroom learning time was missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10523.184s">[Collins]</a>: That's really tough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10523.985s">[Collins]</a>: It's really tough for a lot of students feel for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10528.089s">[Collins]</a>: I will just say that I know the topic of literacy coaches in classroom specifically came up a lot in school committee budget meetings and city council budget meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10539.08s">[Collins]</a>: And as we were discussing, putting together these numbers for Proposition 7 and Proposition 8 specifically, because we know that that is such a need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10547.184s">[Collins]</a>: One of my big concerns if the overrides don't pass is that we would not be able to bring online the literacy coaches that we know that students like your son really need more of in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10558.31s">[Collins]</a>: And if they do pass, we would be empowered to be able to have more of those coaches in the schools helping students make up for the time that they lost during the pandemic and just due to other factors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11568.814s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11569.234s">[Collins]</a>: Appreciate the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11573.024s">[Collins]</a>: I am normally actually and every single penny every single nickel counts type of person in my household budget, certainly, you know, we take every penny very seriously and municipal budgeting because this is our collective wealth to do with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11588.789s">[Collins]</a>: in all of the discussions in public meetings, city council meetings, school committee meetings, task force meetings around what is the number that we should put forward that we're asking people to vote for to invest in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11599.931s">[Collins]</a>: I spent a lot of those meetings advocating for a much, much, much higher number than just 7.5 to be spread around the DPW and the schools and other expenses, but mostly the schools, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11610.293s">[Collins]</a>: And I think when we're having those discussions that are essentially landing at this is the minimum amount that we can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11616.909s">[Collins]</a>: try to invest in our schools to have to at least hold the line and prime the pump for them then getting better in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11624.331s">[Collins]</a>: Maybe not even get better this year, but at least keep them from backsliding so we can hope to have them improve in future fiscal years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11632.454s">[Collins]</a>: When $7 million is the scope of the investment, that is essentially the minimum for not backsliding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11639.576s">[Collins]</a>: You put that against a 2% COLA for certain electeds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11644.372s">[Collins]</a>: and bringing up other electeds to not even parity with that position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11649.773s">[Collins]</a>: I think if we're having an honest discussion, we can all look at that and say apples and oranges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11655.715s">[Collins]</a>: And I'm not trying to be disrespectful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11657.635s">[Collins]</a>: That's my honest opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12055.0s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you and guess on I realize I may have misunderstood your question um with what fiscal year you were talking about but I know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12062.916s">[Collins]</a>: Part of our discussion has been around the salaries that this year are currently on one-time funds that will expire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12070.119s">[Collins]</a>: And putting forward the override questions as an on-ramp for those positions is, again, once that one-time funding that they're currently being funded by has been depleted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12080.542s">[Collins]</a>: But in your clarification, I think that my point might have been usurped by something else that you were saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12091.038s">[Collins]</a>: Only if you have one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12093.359s">[Collins]</a>: No, I'm good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12324.554s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12325.374s">[Collins]</a>: Really fair question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12326.194s">[Collins]</a>: I'm glad that you asked it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12327.775s">[Collins]</a>: In terms of what's directly within our purview as city councilors, I know for as long as I've been on the council, I'm in my second term now, we have been, I think, extremely focused on parts of our jurisdiction that relate directly to expanding commercial tax base, which is the ways that we can increase city revenue without going to residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12348.234s">[Collins]</a>: We've been talking a lot about our zoning project, especially recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12351.074s">[Collins]</a>: It didn't begin recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12352.655s">[Collins]</a>: We've been fighting for, I think, three terms, since longer than I've been on the council, to be able to work with a zoning consultant to do really smart, tailored zoning that will allow us to grow the parts of the city that people have been wanting to see growth in for years, so that we'll see what we wanna see there, and also be adding to our commercial tax base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12370.078s">[Collins]</a>: And we've been starting to do that, and we're already starting to see the seeds of results on Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12375.119s">[Collins]</a>: Of course, that revenue isn't gonna come online<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12378.467s">[Collins]</a>: until like a longer timescale than we really, that's not, we don't see the rewards from that in one year, we see that in five, 10, 20 years, but that is directly within our jurisdiction, and we've been extremely focused on this council, on laying the groundwork for commercial tax-based growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12393.988s">[Collins]</a>: City Hall departments, I think, are really, one of the things that they're remarkable for is in grant-seeking, especially our Planning Development Sustainability Office, and I do know that every department in this city works really hard to get grant funding for some of its essential projects or other projects that we don't have to take those monies out of the operating budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12413.178s">[Collins]</a>: The City Council, whenever we can, we support those grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12417.08s">[Collins]</a>: We approve when that's within our jurisdiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12419.041s">[Collins]</a>: We try to support<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12421.582s">[Collins]</a>: resources, funding for projects coming from not from residents, wallets, essentially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12428.285s">[Collins]</a>: In addition, then there's the advocacy side and people bringing up, what is the state doing about this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12433.267s">[Collins]</a>: What is the state paying and how are other players paying in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12436.149s">[Collins]</a>: We constantly advocate for an increase in trying to remember what this UGGA actually stands for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12443.012s">[Collins]</a>: I think it's unrestricted, like general aggregation, constantly advocating for the state to pay into cities like Medford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12450.755s">[Collins]</a>: more so that we can do more for our residents the way that the state would like us to do, constantly advocating for changes in the payment in lieu of tax agreement laws so that we can turn to institutions like Tufts and say, hey, you don't pay a lot of property tax, all of our other residents do, let's make this more fair, trying to pull what levers we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13215.882s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13216.122s">[Collins]</a>: I just want to thank you for being here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13217.862s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for your advocacy on this issue, and thank you for advocating for firefighters in general in Medford all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13226.184s">[Collins]</a>: I understand that this is complicated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13227.404s">[Collins]</a>: I also know that as a city council, we approach this at different levels of distance from just the dollars and cents of the proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13234.944s">[Collins]</a>: And from the specifics of the fire headquarters proposal that is being worked out between the fire department, maybe fire department leadership is more accurate to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13246.252s">[Collins]</a>: And principally the mayor's office, we're not involved in that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13249.794s">[Collins]</a>: I can say for myself as one counselor that after hearing for so many months and years, this is an improved headquarters is urgently needed, urgently deserved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13257.541s">[Collins]</a>: the fire department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13259.163s">[Collins]</a>: Um, that that is trying to bring that about as expeditiously as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13263.428s">[Collins]</a>: It's my priority as a city counselor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13265.83s">[Collins]</a>: Um, I know from, you know, just following the publications of the, you know, kind of continually updated concept drafts that's put out by the mayor's office that, um, you know, at least from what I from what I'm able to see, it seems like feedback is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13278.945s">[Collins]</a>: continuing to be incorporated and updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13280.846s">[Collins]</a>: Again, I'm just sharing what's visible on my side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13283.147s">[Collins]</a>: I know that there's another perspective that you represent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13287.57s">[Collins]</a>: It is my sincere hope from hearing that this is so urgently needed for so long that we are able to see a truly collaborative process that results in the fire headquarters that the fire department needs, deserves, expects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13304.719s">[Collins]</a>: that we can move on with this urgency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13307.74s">[Collins]</a>: And, you know, I think that that's just what the community needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13310.501s">[Collins]</a>: Certainly that's what the fire department needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13311.962s">[Collins]</a>: And I hope that we can do that on a timeframe that we can move on it this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13316.924s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13801.986s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13802.326s">[Collins]</a>: Appreciate the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13803.146s">[Collins]</a>: Obviously, I'm going to give a highly subjective answer because this isn't really a policy question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13807.947s">[Collins]</a>: You know, obviously, I'm really saddened to see<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13812.759s">[Collins]</a>: Well, let me start here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13814.359s">[Collins]</a>: I really understand why people are so concerned about these questions from both sides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13820.461s">[Collins]</a>: I see people saying, wow, my bills are going to go up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13822.701s">[Collins]</a>: That's really serious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13824.181s">[Collins]</a>: And I need to understand why that's being proposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13826.482s">[Collins]</a>: I can also see people saying, wow, these things that these questions would pay for are really dire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13832.123s">[Collins]</a>: We really need to make sure that these pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13833.823s">[Collins]</a>: And I think people know which camp I'm firmly in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13839.173s">[Collins]</a>: What does sadden me is seeing these two viewpoints, which I think are two positions that we can converse from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13846.215s">[Collins]</a>: We can have discussions from those two poles and not experience division and not experience a crevasse in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13854.977s">[Collins]</a>: To me, I think that we start seeing division in our community when certain people start saying, those people who disagree with you, they are against you, or they are against them, or this is pitting X against Y.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13868.886s">[Collins]</a>: and convince people of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13874.011s">[Collins]</a>: I don't think that that's helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13875.673s">[Collins]</a>: I don't think that that is where we are to be totally honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13878.315s">[Collins]</a>: I know that there's a lot of people who are deeply concerned and have had conversations that haven't been productive or have been offensive, but I actually do not believe at all that this community is divided over these questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13890.927s">[Collins]</a>: And I also just think it's worth noting that at the end of the day, we can have conversations and sometimes those conversations are unpleasant and sometimes those conversations unfortunately are hostile.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13900.536s">[Collins]</a>: But I just fundamentally for ever since we put these on the ballot in June, I am really confused why we are fighting about this because at the end of the day, these questions will be decided in November when we count up the number of people that voted yes and the number of people that voted no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13915.506s">[Collins]</a>: And I think the people that are saying this is dividing you, they want you to feel divided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13920.67s">[Collins]</a>: And I'd say, look at the motivations there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13923.172s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14707.066s">[Collins]</a>: I just echo what President Bears said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14708.647s">[Collins]</a>: I think that these are questions that, you know, and we'd be happy to liaise as council leadership to set this up with the chief assessor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14714.69s">[Collins]</a>: I think that he'd be able to give you much better information than we can on the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16860.213s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16861.454s">[Collins]</a>: I don't have a direct comment to that last question that was made, but I really appreciate it, appreciate the resources that were shared as well and the recommendations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16869.32s">[Collins]</a>: I just wanted to note that it's quite a late hour and we actually have a second meeting to get to after this, so I would not motion, but request that we now proceed to public participation and then adjourn and take up the agenda items on our regular meeting agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=256.4s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for putting this forward, and I motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=272.589s">[Collins]</a>: Yeah, it's in the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=285.084s">[Collins]</a>: Motion to join all the records and reports of committees and then take paper 24483 from the hands of the clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=400.558s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=402.219s">[Collins]</a>: This is a hard one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=403.239s">[Collins]</a>: It's been hard over these past few months not having Larry with us in the chambers like he always, always has been for years and years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=411.823s">[Collins]</a>: It's hard to wrap my head around this, and it's hard to sum up so much of what Larry represented, but Larry was so kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=427.833s">[Collins]</a>: He was so generous with his insight and his experience from so many years of working in City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=433.816s">[Collins]</a>: When I joined the Council three years ago, you know, I felt a little out of place, a little, a little new kid on the block.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=442.558s">[Collins]</a>: And this is just one example of how unflaggingly kind a person Larry is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=447.822s">[Collins]</a>: He never, ever treated me any different than any other counselor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=452.285s">[Collins]</a>: He was kind, he was welcoming, he was welcoming, he took me seriously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=455.347s">[Collins]</a>: And I know that that's how he treated absolutely everybody in his orbit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=458.93s">[Collins]</a>: So he will be so missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=461.311s">[Collins]</a>: And I joined my colleagues in sending our most sincere condolences to his family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1578.293s">[Collins]</a>: I would motion for a moment of silence upon passage and also to dedicate this meeting in Larry's honor, though really he deserves a year's worth of council meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1640.139s">[Collins]</a>: I would motion to suspend the rules to take paper 24477.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1643.16s">[Collins]</a>: On the motion to take paper 24477 and 24478 under suspension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1793.793s">[Collins]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1867.355s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1891.139s">[Collins]</a>: Motion to revert to regular order of business, and then to take paper 24457 from the table, to take both national grid papers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2115.61s">[Collins]</a>: I would motion to approve contingent on the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2119.69s">[Collins]</a>: Conditions recommended by the chief engineer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2589.081s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2589.421s">[Collins]</a>: Our first discussion was, I think, at least a month ago now, and it was a very late hour, so I apologize for any failure of perfect eloquence in my trying to summarize our previous discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2602.804s">[Collins]</a>: My understanding is that the cable that needs to be repaired needs to be repaired, and the nature of the request for amendments largely deals with what area of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2612.463s">[Collins]</a>: street will be repaved as a condition of that cable repair, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2617.889s">[Collins]</a>: I'm sorry, say that again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2620.032s">[Collins]</a>: My understanding is that the cable that needs to be repaired, must be repaired, will be repaired, and the nature of the amendments that National Grid has put forward has to do with what area and how much will be repaved while that cable repair is going on, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2639.67s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2640.01s">[Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2640.31s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2640.87s">[Collins]</a>: Just wanted to clarify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2643.191s">[Collins]</a>: Appreciate you being here again, especially at such a late hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2646.112s">[Collins]</a>: I'm so sorry to keep you and your team here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2648.713s">[Collins]</a>: For myself, I think we had a really helpful discussion about a month ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2652.015s">[Collins]</a>: I reviewed the memos from the city's lawyers, from National Grid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2658.458s">[Collins]</a>: I think at this point, I am feeling confident and standing by the amendments that the council in the previous term put forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2666.322s">[Collins]</a>: I really appreciate the discussions that you've had with us about this, but I think that those current, those existing amendments and the council's rationale behind them for me feels as resonant as it did a year ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2679.048s">[Collins]</a>: So I would motion to deny the request for amendments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2908.262s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2909.362s">[Collins]</a>: I appreciated the discussion of this at our, I think it was our October 2nd committee of the whole, and I would motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2964.93s">[Collins]</a>: Motion to take from the table, paper 23449 and 24458.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=3000.627s">[Collins]</a>: Motion to ordain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=3105.862s">[Collins]</a>: Motion to approve for third reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1058.538s">[Collins]</a>: I'd like to thank Councilor Tseng for moving this project forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1062.581s">[Collins]</a>: I know, as was stated, this is something that the Council has been talking about for a long time, at least since 2022, when I know then President Morell was one of the voices calling out strongly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1073.829s">[Collins]</a>: to make sure that Medford was doing all it could do to protect reproductive reproductive health care is wonder, as well as gender affirming health care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1081.914s">[Collins]</a>: And of course this is a very new draft and we're going to continue to revise this in committee but just for my initial review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1087.037s">[Collins]</a>: I think that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1089.518s">[Collins]</a>: One of the parts of this that really stands out to me that I hope that residents kind of, that I think is very salient and I hope that residents, you know, hear about and understand in this proposed ordinance is the section and again, like draft section C that says no city resources, materials or funds shall be used to facilitate or aid any person seeking to prohibit criminalized sanction, et cetera, the person seeking this kind of care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1112.716s">[Collins]</a>: And I think that's really the point to me here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1114.737s">[Collins]</a>: is that we, I think we know implicitly that it's not appropriate for city resources to be used towards such, you know, essentially extra legal purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1124.78s">[Collins]</a>: And that includes the time of our city employees as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1127.441s">[Collins]</a>: So I'm really proud that we're crafting a policy that enshrines that, and I look forward to continuing to revise this in committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1362.688s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, and sorry, just a clarifying question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1364.409s">[Collins]</a>: I think you already described this, but is the point of that new idea to ensure that pharmacies are complying with providing all of the reproductive health-related medication?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1372.676s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1372.856s">[Collins]</a>: Okay, cool, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1374.097s">[Collins]</a>: I mean, I think that seems part of the theme of these three papers, so I'd be happy to take it up as part of the package.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1689.663s">[Collins]</a>: Oh, sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1690.544s">[Collins]</a>: Just to jump in with, again, preliminary reflections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1694.085s">[Collins]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1694.425s">[Collins]</a>: I think this is, you know, obviously there's a lot of groundwork to lay in terms of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1699.389s">[Collins]</a>: Should we go forward where?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1701.211s">[Collins]</a>: That's kind of step number one in terms of visioning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1704.974s">[Collins]</a>: Step number one in terms of implementation would be thinking through those questions of, how would we bring this about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1709.898s">[Collins]</a>: How much would it cost?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1710.759s">[Collins]</a>: How much would it cost to build?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1711.78s">[Collins]</a>: How much would it cost to maintain, including putting another thing on DPWs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1718.418s">[Collins]</a>: and using that people power.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1720.659s">[Collins]</a>: That's not at all to say that I think we shouldn't do it because it'll take extra resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1723.62s">[Collins]</a>: I think that it's a really good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1725.441s">[Collins]</a>: I think it's a really nice thing to offer to our residents and visitors to this city and to a lot of residents and visitors, it's also a necessary thing that we should be offering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1734.704s">[Collins]</a>: And if this is a difficult project to implement, if it could take five to seven years to put together, maybe it'll take shorter, but maybe it'll take five years to put together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1745.768s">[Collins]</a>: the will and the buy-in and the plans and the money to make this sustainable, then it is good that we're starting now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1751.814s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2017.913s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2018.314s">[Collins]</a>: Yeah, I support the motion, the amended motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2020.656s">[Collins]</a>: And just to further that point, I think that we're at early enough stages here that I'd be curious to hear perspectives from, Councilor Tseng mentioned Director Bailey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2030.405s">[Collins]</a>: I also suspect that this is something that Director O'Connor, even if it's slightly more out of her purview, would have some perspective on as this is a health<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2036.471s">[Collins]</a>: health issue and engages with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2038.592s">[Collins]</a>: I'm sure that the prevention and outreach folks have some, you know, they deal with a constituency that would be one beneficiary of these facilities in addition to many, many more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2047.976s">[Collins]</a>: All that to say, gosh, there's so many ways that like a CBA would go with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2053.179s">[Collins]</a>: I mean, I was thinking like this might be the type of thing that we'd want to get the Chamber of Commerce's feedback on because I know that it is kind of a pressure that Main Street businesses have to deal with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2060.422s">[Collins]</a>: We want your patronage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2061.762s">[Collins]</a>: We don't necessarily want to be a restroom facility for people in public, though they need one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2066.044s">[Collins]</a>: So I'd just be really curious to put this pardon me, um, to as many city staff as possible at this early stage because I wouldn't be surprised if we get a lot of support from a lot of different departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2077.109s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2101.371s">[Collins]</a>: Yeah, I think that we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2102.952s">[Collins]</a>: I've certainly made many motions in the past at committee meetings that present a idea proposal or a draft ordinance and send it out to department heads and encourage them at their discretion to get feedback from staff in their department or to just give feedback as department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2154.475s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2154.796s">[Collins]</a>: And I'll just notice for the edification of counselors that haven't done a ordinance process precisely like this before that for me in the past, at least, um, that process is often paired with simply, you know, as as sponsor of the ordinance reaching out to department heads one on one to have conversations about them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2296.633s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2296.993s">[Collins]</a>: Yeah, I appreciate the words from Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2299.935s">[Collins]</a>: And I also just want to note, again, we're talking about something, a project that we're at the very, very preliminary stages of, especially with the restroom facilities and public spaces, which is, you know, more logistical than just us crafting an ordinance and working with city staff to implement it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2316.868s">[Collins]</a>: But also, this is part of a story tradition of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2321.091s">[Collins]</a>: elected and city staff working together to bring online what are essentially logistical or capital expenses, which is a, you know, usually a multi year process, and we've approved some cap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2335.498s">[Collins]</a>: capital expenditures from our stabilization funds recently that are kind of, you know, kind of tell the end of that story where these capital expenses have been requested and advocated for and discussed and budgeted for and plan for for years and then eventually we get the, you know that the planning and the funds come together and we're able to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2355.45s">[Collins]</a>: them together and make an expenditure and bring something online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2358.052s">[Collins]</a>: And in both cases, it's something that we know that we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2360.915s">[Collins]</a>: It's something that pertains directly to the existing needs of residents, and it takes a few years sometimes to bring it into implementation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2367.381s">[Collins]</a>: But I just see that as part of that same process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2369.603s">[Collins]</a>: So again, I appreciate Councilor Tseng for bringing this forward, and I think that our discussions about this topic<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2376.229s">[Collins]</a>: to make sure that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2376.709s">[Collins]</a>: Um are well worth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2377.25s">[Collins]</a>: It will be well worth it to residents and visitors to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2380.891s">[Collins]</a>: Um and the same for the ordinances that we're working on in concert to make sure that, um, people in Medford have fallen unfettered access to the rights that they already have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2389.856s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2573.396s">[Collins]</a>: I would just motion to keep all papers in committee and adjourn pending further comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2578.599s">[Collins]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=23.712s">[Collins]</a>: I can't show you anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4389.973s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4390.253s">[Collins]</a>: I'll just keep this pretty brief and high level because the City Council has had a lot of meetings about the issue of private roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4399.776s">[Collins]</a>: City Council has had quite a lot of meetings about the issue of private roads in particular over the past three years that I've been part of the Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4408.936s">[Collins]</a>: What I have learned is that for the city to adopt what is currently a private road is an incredibly expensive process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4414.56s">[Collins]</a>: Obviously, the cost of private roads is expensive to residents, while it's still a private road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4421.625s">[Collins]</a>: For it to become a city on a public road, it has to be fully bought up to par, which is incredibly expensive on the order of millions, so that it can be maintained according to the status quo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4431.043s">[Collins]</a>: And I think that we all know that to improve the city's street canopy, to do that stuff removal that residents have been asking for, that city staff have been trying to do over so many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4440.969s">[Collins]</a>: The point I'm trying to make is that we know that these needs that they're not being filled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4444.551s">[Collins]</a>: We've been trying to make headway on them for such a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4447.253s">[Collins]</a>: The reason that we're not making the headway that residents are really dying to see is because they are so expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4451.915s">[Collins]</a>: And to me, that underlines the need to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4455.577s">[Collins]</a>: use this as a pivot point to try and begin making the investments that will result in visible improvements in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4464.684s">[Collins]</a>: Because we know that there are a lot of residents who would love to at least be on the path towards progress, who would love to see a new private road, be eligible for adoption, and would like to see a more actionable plan for bringing some of those tree stumps down to earth and actually see our tree county expanding in these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4480.895s">[Collins]</a>: And UC Central, they are incredibly expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=238.26s">[Collins]</a>: All right, we're going to get started in just a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=240.461s">[Collins]</a>: Welcome, everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=283.424s">[Collins]</a>: Thanks for bearing with us, everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=297.503s">[Collins]</a>: I believe President Bears will be joining us in just a minute, so we can give it another couple of moments for folks to get situated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=350.202s">[Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please just let me know whenever you're ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=359.726s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=361.307s">[Collins]</a>: All right, there will be a meeting of the Medford City Council Planning and Permitting Committee, October 23rd, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=366.389s">[Collins]</a>: This meeting will take place at 6.30 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=370.151s">[Collins]</a>: by Zoom only due to early voting in the council chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=374.232s">[Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=410.918s">[Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=411.979s">[Collins]</a>: Five present, none absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=413.38s">[Collins]</a>: The meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=415.763s">[Collins]</a>: The action discussion item for this meeting is again 24-033 zoning ordinance updates with the Innis associates team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=426.094s">[Collins]</a>: This is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=428.55s">[Collins]</a>: an exciting moment in our journey through our zoning update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=432.114s">[Collins]</a>: We have been meeting, of course, with our zoning consultant and associates since the beginning of this term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=440.424s">[Collins]</a>: beginning in July with our mapping workshop, we started our targeted discussions of the Mystic Avenue corridor district, discussing that through July and August, and having more tweaks and changes to the draft proposal over the past couple months with a lot of input from city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=461.771s">[Collins]</a>: We've been continuing those last changes in committee over the past couple meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=467.753s">[Collins]</a>: and tonight I believe that we have a mostly finalized proposal that the zoning consultant has put together for us that councilors got a chance to look at over the weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=477.717s">[Collins]</a>: And I think the intent for tonight is for us to have a final discussion of the Mystic Avenue Corridor District in this committee before it goes out to review by a procedural step at a regular meeting of the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=491.261s">[Collins]</a>: and then review by Community Development Board before it again comes back to the City Council for another hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=497.644s">[Collins]</a>: So we have a short list of the specific pieces of the zoning proposal within the package that Councilors received in their agenda packets last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=512.19s">[Collins]</a>: That kind of break down the proposal into its constituent parts in terms of how it fits into our zoning bylaws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=517.933s">[Collins]</a>: I'm happy to run through those, but I'm sure that our city staff from the planning department or Emily or Paola from Ennis Associates could do a more elegant job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=527.117s">[Collins]</a>: I also want to make sure that we touch on the timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=529.918s">[Collins]</a>: You know, just again, we've been doing this at every meeting, but just to again, kind of recenter ourselves and how we got here at this step in the, at this stage of our timeline, going from several years ago with these kind of goals and visions being formed through our housing production plan and comprehensive plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=547.319s">[Collins]</a>: Um, so I would be happy to, um, recognize, um, Director Hunt or, um, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=551.002s">[Collins]</a>: Um if either of you would like to start us off an<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=576.604s">[Collins]</a>: Yeah, I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=577.325s">[Collins]</a>: Yeah, I'm happy to pass it off to Director Hunt or Emily after a note from Councilor Scarpelli to orient us to what we're reviewing tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=585.833s">[Collins]</a>: But first, go ahead, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=657.714s">[Collins]</a>: I think that a couple ways to answer that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=659.956s">[Collins]</a>: I think that there isn't a plan to have community meetings in between this meeting and when it goes to the regular meeting of the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=667.443s">[Collins]</a>: I will say that everything that this proposal is based on was really forged<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=673.909s">[Collins]</a>: through robust community engagement really over the course of years between city staff planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=681.595s">[Collins]</a>: Pardon me, I'm speaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=683.056s">[Collins]</a>: That was forged through the comprehensive plan formation, which was a year's long community engagement process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=689.501s">[Collins]</a>: I also know that there were certain parts of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=692.583s">[Collins]</a>: the Mystic Avenue Corridor District proposal that we actually pulled back on because we decided that there hadn't been enough robust community engagement when it came to including certain residential streets in that corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=703.951s">[Collins]</a>: We decided we're actually not ready to pull the trigger on that without engaging those specific residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=708.255s">[Collins]</a>: So we've been really conscious of the community buy-in aspect throughout this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=715.48s">[Collins]</a>: And of course, you know, we've been really doing our due diligence over these past few months of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=723.445s">[Collins]</a>: we are doing on the mystic Avenue quarter district proposal in this committee and giving the public every opportunity to add to the community feedback that was already given over the course of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=734.407s">[Collins]</a>: Um on the concert him to on the sorry on the comprehensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=738.328s">[Collins]</a>: Planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=739.448s">[Collins]</a>: Process Um, so I look forward to continuing to welcome the public into these<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=748.75s">[Collins]</a>: this committee is working on and that residents are really, really welcome to part of this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=753.431s">[Collins]</a>: But at this point, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=755.552s">[Collins]</a>: I think that I'm excited to get excited to hear from our city staff and our zoning consultant on exactly if I can follow up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=762.794s">[Collins]</a>: Excuse me, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=764.495s">[Collins]</a>: You can wait until I'm finished speaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=766.695s">[Collins]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=767.896s">[Collins]</a>: I think at this point, it would be important for us to first orient and what we're looking at today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=771.737s">[Collins]</a>: I want us to get oriented on what we're looking at today from, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=824.443s">[Collins]</a>: I'm not sure what you're referring to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=829.945s">[Collins]</a>: I'm just trying to chair a meeting, George.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=831.726s">[Collins]</a>: I'm going to say it up top.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=833.267s">[Collins]</a>: This is a working meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=834.447s">[Collins]</a>: We've had a lot of working meetings over the past few months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=836.448s">[Collins]</a>: We are not going to be interrupting each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=838.168s">[Collins]</a>: I am the chair of this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=839.649s">[Collins]</a>: I will recognize all participants, including counselors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=842.97s">[Collins]</a>: I will not be interrupted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=845.211s">[Collins]</a>: We are going to go through the zoning memo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=846.812s">[Collins]</a>: We are going to have a respectful conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=851.256s">[Collins]</a>: This process was informed by community outreach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=853.899s">[Collins]</a>: That is a fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=855.18s">[Collins]</a>: And if you had concerns about the specific way that we've been doing community outreach through this committee process, you could have brought that up at any time starting in July and not at the 11th hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=863.948s">[Collins]</a>: And I'm just going to say that at the top of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=866.049s">[Collins]</a>: Now I'd like to recognize Director Hunt or Innis Associates to walk us through the memo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=874.048s">[Collins]</a>: Madam Vice President, I'm going to give you one more time and then we're going to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=919.74s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Burris.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=920.721s">[Collins]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1066.411s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1067.251s">[Collins]</a>: We'll go now to Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1069.652s">[Collins]</a>: For clarity, George, you got to wait for me to recognize you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1072.133s">[Collins]</a>: We're going now to Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1076.475s">[Collins]</a>: Director Hunt, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1976.906s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1977.887s">[Collins]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1978.567s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for the overview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1979.488s">[Collins]</a>: I know that this was a pretty substantial package that counselors received before the weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1984.152s">[Collins]</a>: I know I've given it my review, clarified some things in the text.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1989.977s">[Collins]</a>: I'd like to ask my fellow counselors if there's any questions on this section that they want clarification on before we move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2000.566s">[Collins]</a>: Go ahead, President Burris.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2156.679s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2157.179s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for the question, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2158.32s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for weighing in on that, Emily and Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2164.125s">[Collins]</a>: Are there any other questions from councillors on this section of the zoning proposal at this time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2173.737s">[Collins]</a>: Seeing none, Emily, anything else that you wanted to flag from other sections of the four main components of the zoning proposal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2204.571s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2205.233s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2205.794s">[Collins]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2210.117s">[Collins]</a>: Director Hunt or Planner Evans, is there any other, I know for myself, there's plenty that we can speak to that we've been speaking to in terms of the main headlines of what we're looking at tonight, how those fit into the overall zoning structure, where these elements come from, why they are important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2227.388s">[Collins]</a>: We've spoken about that before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2228.329s">[Collins]</a>: I'm happy to speak to that again, but I'd like to defer to city staff first, if there's any other pieces of context or especially important points that you'd like to raise before we discuss our next steps on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2399.13s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2399.911s">[Collins]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2400.652s">[Collins]</a>: And I think that's a really important point that we have to do this work in sections because otherwise it just doesn't make sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2407.999s">[Collins]</a>: It's just not approachable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2409.361s">[Collins]</a>: However,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2411.124s">[Collins]</a>: you know, we can take these books back off the shelf.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2414.745s">[Collins]</a>: All of these components of our zoning, like anything else in our code of ordinances, can be updated, can be amended, we can look at again, we can tweak, we can see what comes up later in this process that informs another change that we decide we actually want to make to the MACD, the Mystic Avenue Border District.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2433.032s">[Collins]</a>: we might.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2433.953s">[Collins]</a>: Find something later in the process that we decide something can be changed to bring more consistency to the citywide zoning map.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2440.716s">[Collins]</a>: Um there's I think it's I'm glad you are reminding us and reminding the public that even though we're kind of breaking this overall project into chunks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2450.86s">[Collins]</a>: Um that's not a door that closes and locks and all of these can continue to be considered in tandem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2738.578s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Barrett, I think those I think those points are really well taken, and I think that it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2744.571s">[Collins]</a>: I think it's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2745.391s">[Collins]</a>: I think that this is a really big job this committee has been attempting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2750.752s">[Collins]</a>: The comprehensive zoning update just on the technical stuff is a lot for one committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2757.593s">[Collins]</a>: And now that we've gone through a couple cycles of packages that this committee has looked at, I'm hoping that we can begin to shoulder a little bit more and pair our next package of updates with indeed improving and adding more to our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2772.956s">[Collins]</a>: how we're communicating about it and how we're communicating about that to the public, to the councillors that aren't on this committee, to city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2782.119s">[Collins]</a>: I think it will help us keep on track and accomplish all that we hope to, to put out that more specific, well, we've put out specific calendars of what we hope to get to and when, and I think that what we need to do now, as you said, is to break that down to an even more granular level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2798.043s">[Collins]</a>: this week and this month, we're looking at this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2799.864s">[Collins]</a>: Two weeks later, we're looking at this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2801.745s">[Collins]</a>: Here's the goal for that month, et cetera, to keep us on track and to make sure that residents, the public business owners, have the best possible chance of knowing, I think I might wanna weigh in on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2813.131s">[Collins]</a>: Okay, I'm gonna save that date on my calendar and make it really easy for folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2817.013s">[Collins]</a>: Go ahead, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2984.445s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2985.467s">[Collins]</a>: Yeah, I think there's a lot of things that we could do that would strengthen our signaling overall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2992.926s">[Collins]</a>: Go ahead, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3022.87s">[Collins]</a>: great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3023.21s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3023.891s">[Collins]</a>: Yeah, I think that that would be a great candidate for, uh, the steering committee to look at in advance of the next committee meeting so that we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3031.815s">[Collins]</a>: We already re center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3033.216s">[Collins]</a>: Um, once the Mr. Court, Mr. Gavin Porter District is on its way, um, to the regular meeting and then the CBB and we can touch base on where we go from here and bring that back to the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3045.784s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3183.916s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3184.696s">[Collins]</a>: President bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3185.176s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3188.898s">[Collins]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3191.363s">[Collins]</a>: We have a great next step in front of us in terms of the zoning proposal before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3199.307s">[Collins]</a>: And I think we have some really great suggestions for how to go forward with our work plan and also pair that with kind of some renewed efforts around how to structure that, how to be telegraphing that structure and what's coming down the pipeline better to all participants, to all stakeholders as we go on in this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3219.576s">[Collins]</a>: Councilor Callahan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3292.964s">[Collins]</a>: Go ahead, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3293.864s">[Collins]</a>: And great question, Councilor Hillian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3398.344s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3399.345s">[Collins]</a>: Councilor Callahan, do you have anything else that you want to add to that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3407.733s">[Collins]</a>: All right, sounds like a no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3409.134s">[Collins]</a>: Councilor Leming, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3443.183s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3445.244s">[Collins]</a>: Director Hunt, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3476.107s">[Collins]</a>: great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3476.427s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3528.444s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3529.164s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3530.125s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Lohmann.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3530.846s">[Collins]</a>: I appreciate that suggestion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3531.966s">[Collins]</a>: I think that's a good idea to bring another local expert in on that conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3537.65s">[Collins]</a>: If there aren't any other specific questions or comments at this time, I think it might be valuable before we start talking about next steps, a vote on this package and where it goes after it leaves this committee, if that's how the vote goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3551.219s">[Collins]</a>: Emily or Paola, if you wouldn't mind pulling the zoning map up on the screen,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3555.081s">[Collins]</a>: and just quickly giving us a walk through that visual brief description.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3558.543s">[Collins]</a>: Again, I know this is materials we've all seen before, but just to have another look at the updated zoning map with the four sub districts and just to describe once again the characterization of each.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3574.532s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3654.822s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3655.482s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Paula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3656.503s">[Collins]</a>: Appreciate that overview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3658.904s">[Collins]</a>: And again, committee members know this, but just for any residents that didn't catch the past couple meetings when we were also reviewing this map.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3671.246s">[Collins]</a>: on a more, you know, kind of section by section basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3676.148s">[Collins]</a>: This has gone through a couple of minor changes from the original proposal about a month ago, including, you know, finessing, especially on the southern side of the map, where MX3 ends and commercial begins, making that carve out in the commercial zone on the southern side of Mystic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3695.557s">[Collins]</a>: the Hicks area, creating, yes, as Paola is highlighting, inserting mixed-use one, which seems more appropriate for that area, around the residential, the park, and the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3708.421s">[Collins]</a>: So just to highlight some of the small changes that this map went through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3712.922s">[Collins]</a>: I'll recognize Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3754.26s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3754.48s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for the question, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3756.381s">[Collins]</a>: And just on that, in case it wasn't touched on this meeting, I'm not sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3759.063s">[Collins]</a>: It's my understanding that we are legally required to have that use allowed somewhere in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3764.568s">[Collins]</a>: It's not that we're going out of our way to make sure that adult use establishments are present on Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3769.091s">[Collins]</a>: It's just that we are legally required to have them be allowed somewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3801.558s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for that clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3805.148s">[Collins]</a>: questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3805.408s">[Collins]</a>: Um if there aren't any other questions or comments on the updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3810.351s">[Collins]</a>: Oh, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3810.951s">[Collins]</a>: Planner Evans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3967.88s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Planner Evans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3968.62s">[Collins]</a>: I think that's a really important point to make sure that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3974.045s">[Collins]</a>: environmentally unfriendly, highly pervious surface doesn't get inadvertently grandfathered in while we're waiting, you know, a short number of weeks, it sounds like for the green score to be able to be considered as a global strategy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3988.314s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3991.216s">[Collins]</a>: Any other questions or notes before I start discussing our next steps after this committee meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3999.36s">[Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3999.48s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3999.7s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4000.661s">[Collins]</a>: So, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4002.682s">[Collins]</a>: As is true of all updates to zoning amendments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4006.825s">[Collins]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4008.286s">[Collins]</a>: Now that this has been considered in committee if it were to pass into the next step would be to pass it into a regular meeting with the City Council there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4016.072s">[Collins]</a>: Procedurally it must be immediately referred to the Community Development Board for their review and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4026.839s">[Collins]</a>: and then the two votes to codify it into our into our code of zoning ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4034.924s">[Collins]</a>: So that is another several slate of meetings that we will have to get the input of the planning board and to have it appear before the full assembly of the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4043.649s">[Collins]</a>: That's three more times before it is fully codified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4049.053s">[Collins]</a>: So I always appreciate that in the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4051.627s">[Collins]</a>: Zoning updating process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4052.688s">[Collins]</a>: It's really baked in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4053.489s">[Collins]</a>: You know, there's really no way to avoid a lot of eyes on this highly technical, very important, very consequential changes, and I'm really glad that that is written into the procedure of how this gets done because, of course, we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4067.944s">[Collins]</a>: This step is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4068.704s">[Collins]</a>: It's very detailed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4069.325s">[Collins]</a>: It's very technical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4070.505s">[Collins]</a>: We have to get it right because what we're doing here is we're implementing the goals and visions of the community that was kind of enshrined in the comprehensive plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4078.55s">[Collins]</a>: And I'm grateful that we get to include a lot of hands onto this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4087.294s">[Collins]</a>: Any questions about our next steps in moving this package forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4096.147s">[Collins]</a>: seeing none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4096.767s">[Collins]</a>: So I understand that we have, you know, this short list of tweaks that the zoning consultant will consider in between now and when this goes to the Community Development Board, the changes that we discussed on this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4112.232s">[Collins]</a>: And we'll be sure in our steering meetings to make sure that those are surfaced and make sure that all those boxes are ticked off before this comes back to the City Council for those final two votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4128.444s">[Collins]</a>: Do I hear, before I recognize public participation, is there a motion on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4135.392s">[Collins]</a>: I'll go to public participation first if counselors want to think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4144.283s">[Collins]</a>: I'll recognize Martha Andres.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4147.046s">[Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4248.479s">[Collins]</a>: That's all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4249.999s">[Collins]</a>: Thanks, Martha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4250.66s">[Collins]</a>: Really appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4252.08s">[Collins]</a>: And just to flag what Director Hunt put in the comments, we have these maps up on the website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4257.601s">[Collins]</a>: They are kind of buried, so I don't falter for not being able to find them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4262.382s">[Collins]</a>: It's in the chat under phase two, October 23 meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4266.924s">[Collins]</a>: It's also attached to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4269.969s">[Collins]</a>: the agenda for this meeting on the City Council's public portal, but I'm gonna, well, maybe we can chat about how to just reorder the items on the city's zoning website so that the most current materials are easier to find.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4281.071s">[Collins]</a>: But those are online for you to check out if you'd like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4283.612s">[Collins]</a>: President Bears, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4382.036s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4383.697s">[Collins]</a>: Planner Evans, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4422.747s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Planner Evans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4424.068s">[Collins]</a>: Yeah, I appreciate the suggestion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4425.369s">[Collins]</a>: I think it's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4427.351s">[Collins]</a>: And certainly we would want to give it a thorough look if that recommendation came back to make sure that it's appropriately cited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4440.342s">[Collins]</a>: Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4569.413s">[Collins]</a>: Going through all of the zoning citywide in this committee in tandem with city stakeholders, the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4581.238s">[Collins]</a>: I want to thank NS Associates for being here as always.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4610.512s">[Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4643.792s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4644.533s">[Collins]</a>: Five in favor, none opposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4646.414s">[Collins]</a>: The meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4647.955s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you very much, everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4650.017s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1143.2s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Baird for putting this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1144.8s">[Collins]</a>: I also corresponded with Mr. Bohannon a little bit after he emailed the council and just wanted to reiterate, he was truly so grateful to the two DPW employees who went out of their way to help them out of a, you know, a sticky situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1157.984s">[Collins]</a>: And it was so nice to get such a heartwarming letter about somebody saying, you know, this is what I know to expect from civil servants in Medford and just going out of his way to thank them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1168.007s">[Collins]</a>: So I extend those thanks to our DPW and those two gentlemen in particular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1408.423s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President bears at the planning and permitting meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1411.703s">[Collins]</a>: Last week we met once again with the council's zoning consultant and associates we reviewed the latest draft of the zoning proposal for the mystic Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1423.687s">[Collins]</a>: Trying to get the new acronym, the mystic have Valley District, which is on the city council agenda tonight for us to report out to the Community Development Board which is procedurally the next step in any zoning amendment process so we had a discussion and then we voted it out of committee motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2172.11s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2172.87s">[Collins]</a>: And I also want to appreciate the petitioner for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2175.771s">[Collins]</a>: I think it's really important for us to use this forum for folks to have that additional opportunity to say, here are my concerns with the RFP in general, this zone in general, this project in general.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2190.095s">[Collins]</a>: I think there's absolutely, you know, we thank you for, you know, again, voicing how important it is for, you know, everybody who needs access to the senior center and any, however they get there, whether it's by bus or by shuttle, by carpool,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2201.758s">[Collins]</a>: or by driving themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2203.819s">[Collins]</a>: The senior center is so important to Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2206.361s">[Collins]</a>: I'm heartened to see, you know, in the mayor's, in the memo from the planning department that that has been reiterated to some of the development, sorry, some of the developers who went on that site walk, that that's been said to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2217.949s">[Collins]</a>: But I think it's important that we, you know, continue to reiterate this priority, which is a priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2222.592s">[Collins]</a>: We have to make sure that people who need access to the senior center can continue to access it how they need to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2229.197s">[Collins]</a>: So we'll continue to help you emphasize that, and thank you for speaking to your concerns today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4306.607s">[Collins]</a>: To revert to the regular order of meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5259.786s">[Collins]</a>: Nothing major for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5260.587s">[Collins]</a>: I just want to thank the chief for spending some time with us tonight and for answering our questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5374.5s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President bears, I won't go into this and, you know, granular detail because it's been discussed so much in committee and because the council will, because the community will have a couple additional public hearings to really dive into the details if they so choose at the Community Development Board meeting which I believe to scheduled<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5391.87s">[Collins]</a>: November 20 is the date that's been penciled in to review this zoning proposal before it comes back to the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5398.897s">[Collins]</a>: But just before I make the motion to refer to the Community Development Board which again is just procedurally the next step that we have to take before we consider taking a vote on any zoning change to our zoning ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5412.45s">[Collins]</a>: As president bear said we've had many meetings on this district in the planning and permitting committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5418.714s">[Collins]</a>: This is a really exciting juncture for me personally as one counselor because over so many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5428.76s">[Collins]</a>: with people in Medford, you know, not just people in City Hall, but just folks out on the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5433.461s">[Collins]</a>: It comes up so often, how much potential Mystic Ave has and how people look around and say, you know, what's here is really great, but we know this can be so much more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5443.304s">[Collins]</a>: We see a lot of flatland, we see some vacant buildings, we see some lots that seem underdeveloped, and people can see the potential there for things that it's interesting for residents to go to, lots that will be really interesting for developers to want to develop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5458.189s">[Collins]</a>: And in, you know, a lot of potential new commercial growth for our city which I know is really important to all of us and a really shared value for all of us to grow our commercial tax base though so that we can grow without.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5470.672s">[Collins]</a>: having to levy all of that burden onto our residential tax base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5474.956s">[Collins]</a>: So with a lot of the goals, those goals in mind, and with the comprehensive plan, you know, guiding our beginning of this process, we took a look at this district, our zoning consultant was able to propose kind of a slate of sub districts that would make sense for different parts of this corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5491.79s">[Collins]</a>: Of course, this corridor is very heavily commercial, heavily commercial, heavily commercial industrial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5497.514s">[Collins]</a>: ended about some residential areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5499.015s">[Collins]</a>: So we took a lot of care in discussing what parts of that corridor, the north side closer to Medford Square, what type of mixed use involving commercial but not explicitly commercial makes sense for that zone as you get down further south towards Somerville, towards some of the more residential areas, what makes sense there, what's going to be good for development, what will buffer those residential areas from the commercial development that we hope to see there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5523.324s">[Collins]</a>: So we took a lot of time with those questions<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5526.145s">[Collins]</a>: And I'm very proud of the collaboration and the updated proposed zoning map that's come out of that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5534.167s">[Collins]</a>: Of course, all those nitty gritties, the dimensional standards that inform what we're proposing that developers can develop there in each sub-district, depending on the conditions of the sub-district and other incentives that they may or may not take advantage of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5549.63s">[Collins]</a>: All that to say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5551.09s">[Collins]</a>: There's a lot of weeds for people to dig into and I really do recommend that folks watch the meetings of the planning and permitting committee where this was discussed, or attend the Community Development Board meeting on what I believe is going to be November 20, if you want to have an even closer look at some of those details.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5568.82s">[Collins]</a>: But I do want to thank the committee for going through this process I think this is a really important part of the zoning overhaul that this council has been really working very hard<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5578.025s">[Collins]</a>: to make progress on for this entire term and the previous two councils including the one that I wasn't on yet was working really hard to do this zoning work so that the, the things that residents of the community and business owners of the community have been asking the city to move on for such a long time that we're, you know, starting to make some real progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5596.612s">[Collins]</a>: So on that, I would motion to refer this to the Community Development Board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6620.716s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6621.276s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for flagging those Councilor Callahan I know that for, for myself even having spent a lot of time with these documents, it is a lot of material, so thank you for the close read.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6632.802s">[Collins]</a>: I just wanted to note and again this doesn't pertain to the motion that we're making tonight which is just to send this along to the next body which is, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6640.645s">[Collins]</a>: The, the board members who will again look through this for a fine tooth comb but just on the, on the community engagement piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6647.408s">[Collins]</a>: I just didn't want to speak to that again, quickly, just to note that I think, I think it's really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6652.99s">[Collins]</a>: And when I speak to what we're what we're doing and what we've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6655.751s">[Collins]</a>: And that's on any topic not just the zoning it's it's not because I'm trying to make the point that, you know, we're doing a B and C so you know we got a 100%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6666.295s">[Collins]</a>: and we're perfect and we shouldn't do anything more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6668.676s">[Collins]</a>: I think as public servants we always aspire to, you know, in our fantasy version of our jobs we would talk to every single person and of course we can't do that, but I think it's really important that we always aspire to be catching more people, to be going into these projects with the assumption that everybody might have an opinion and if they do then it should be heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6691.753s">[Collins]</a>: I think what is, you know, it is genuinely challenging and this project and many others is that we take that ideal that responsibility to incorporate as much public feedback as we possibly can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6705.477s">[Collins]</a>: And we have to reconcile that with what we can do and what we can say to residents that we are doing so that we're consistent, and so that they have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6715.1s">[Collins]</a>: realistic expectations about where to find us and how we'll find them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6719.124s">[Collins]</a>: So when I say you know I think after the last meeting we had some conversations with the zoning consultant to say, Okay, we've gone through, you know, kind of one and a half zoning packages now we have this proposal we have the proposal of kind of more technical tweaks that we put forward around the end of the fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6734.997s">[Collins]</a>: Now we're kind of in our groove.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6737.219s">[Collins]</a>: You know it's really time to bolster this what what more can we do so that it is so that it is as it should be easier for folks to get involved easier for more people to know what's coming up further ahead of time because that's really important, that is really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6754.184s">[Collins]</a>: And to me, you know what it says, when it comes to, you know, the one proposal to what's ahead of time let's make a schedule for what we're talking about in which month, so that we know so that the city staff knows so that residents can know essentially kind of have this more save the date type format, so that folks can know and really prepare and say okay I have that date in my mind if I want to attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6775.569s">[Collins]</a>: I'll be sure to attend, which is not to say that that's the perfect forum for feedback or that it should be the only forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6784.233s">[Collins]</a>: Knowing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6787.506s">[Collins]</a>: We are a city council in a city that does not yet have the resources for robust public engagement that we want to model ourselves off of that other neighboring communities do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6798.108s">[Collins]</a>: I think that gives us the opportunity to at least be expanding our reach by being able to say ahead of time, here's the meeting on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6806.39s">[Collins]</a>: If it's relevant to you, please save the date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6808.871s">[Collins]</a>: If this format isn't doable for you, you have at least a month to let us know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6813.152s">[Collins]</a>: If you can't get to this meeting,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6815.732s">[Collins]</a>: Let us know send us an email call us if you're a person who has to be engaged in your community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6820.376s">[Collins]</a>: Let us know so that we can find a way to accommodate and come to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6823.778s">[Collins]</a>: What I'm trying to say is, I know that in the scope of this project with so much to cover it might not be, we might not be able to do what I think we all want to do, which is to have multiple community meetings in every neighborhood for every topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6836.828s">[Collins]</a>: We can aspire to that I hope that we can do that especially in some of our more residential neighborhoods, where a lot of care has to be taken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6843.493s">[Collins]</a>: But especially to me as committee chair it is very important that we are able to tell people what to expect and that do that consistently because I think that is really important for access as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6853.401s">[Collins]</a>: So just to note that for going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6855.342s">[Collins]</a>: I'm excited about the, you know, expanded messaging that we're going to be doing as we head into the new year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6865.049s">[Collins]</a>: And just to reiterate that, you know, we're, I'm really grateful to be guided by so many plans that were created in collaboration with the community over the course of years that lay the foundation for everything that we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6876.935s">[Collins]</a>: And that, you know, it shouldn't go without saying that having the community involved in this process is really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6885.219s">[Collins]</a>: And I think as public servants, we're always trying to think about realistically how to do that better and better every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6890.382s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7150.36s">[Collins]</a>: I'm happy to defer to Director Crowley if she would like to present first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7299.12s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for being present, Director Crowley, and for answering our questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7303.622s">[Collins]</a>: I'm always happy to see a contract get resolved and always happy for the opportunity to approve and to waive the second and third readings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7549.983s">[Collins]</a>: I'll motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8695.842s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Commissioner for being with us tonight, just to again paraphrase this to make sure that I haven't taken a look at that site as well in anticipation of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8704.947s">[Collins]</a>: So just to make sure I have a correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8710.365s">[Collins]</a>: This transfer of the paper way would allow to Joseph Street to reconstruct the retaining wall, which fell down earlier this year and transferring<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8722.745s">[Collins]</a>: Transferring one half the rates would allow them to do that and transferring the rights on the city side would remove us from liability so that they could go about and do their construction in a way that wouldn't implicate the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8732.707s">[Collins]</a>: And it's not like we're going to build a city road on that paper way anyway, due to the grade, it would be dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8739.108s">[Collins]</a>: So that wouldn't come about in the future anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8741.889s">[Collins]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=48.686s">[Collins]</a>: Test one two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=55.768s">[Collins]</a>: Test one two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5331.527s">[Collins]</a>: Let's see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5334.568s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5335.368s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you President bears and I wanted to thank Councilor loving for researching the implementation of the new heroes act and for putting this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5342.53s">[Collins]</a>: I'm really proud that over this term and the previous term the city council has worked to make sure that the city of Medford is maximized out on all of the tax exemption programs that are offered to us by the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5353.952s">[Collins]</a>: And so I thank the counselor for his quick work on making sure that we adopted this one too, so that we could extend tax exemption benefits to veterans in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7045.436s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7046.096s">[Collins]</a>: Yeah, 11 Strathmore Road, number two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7048.898s">[Collins]</a>: My name is Kit Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7049.818s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for the opportunity to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7051.939s">[Collins]</a>: So really grateful that this resolution has been brought up tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7055.521s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for creating the opportunity for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7057.915s">[Collins]</a>: residents and counselors to speak about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7061.677s">[Collins]</a>: I just wanted to echo some of what's already been said before by counselors and other community members and say that I really feel strongly that conversations are so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7074.343s">[Collins]</a>: I think that we need a really discreet programming and funding and concrete channels to continue conversations about race and racism in Medford and white privilege and white supremacy in Medford and how to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7087.183s">[Collins]</a>: systemically unweave those realities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7091.086s">[Collins]</a>: And I think that also, you know, it's so important that we not allow these conversations to get derailed from the focus on addressing structural inequity as it exists in Medford, as it does, you know, in in almost every community across the nation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7106.418s">[Collins]</a>: And I think that we've had some really great outlines of things that we can do to begin to, to address those and to think in those directions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7113.663s">[Collins]</a>: And some of that some of that thought is already underway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7116.785s">[Collins]</a>: which, you know, is good, is encouraging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7120.027s">[Collins]</a>: It might be overdue, but it's good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7122.668s">[Collins]</a>: And, you know, I think that to say, you know, we've reached the end of our road here because, you know, the buck has stopped somewhere else, you know, just means that we're wasting time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7135.554s">[Collins]</a>: I think that, like, we must be reflecting on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7141.4s">[Collins]</a>: the spaces that we occupy, especially for people who already hold power in city government, for those who have plenty of spaces in the city where they already feel comfortable and feel comfortable talking about race, which certainly doesn't apply to everybody and doesn't affect people of every race equally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7157.205s">[Collins]</a>: I think that we have to do the work of looking inward and saying, if there does seem to be a communication breakdown, if we feel like we're not hearing these stories, let's first look at the environment that we're perpetuating and creating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7168.588s">[Collins]</a>: What can we be doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7169.952s">[Collins]</a>: so that we can be receiving this communication?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7173.154s">[Collins]</a>: Is there things that we could do to make these spaces ones in which everybody can feel comfortable talking about these uncomfortable and sometimes outright dangerous topics?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7187.304s">[Collins]</a>: I think that there's a role for the city council to have in being a really full-throated proponent of anti-racism measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7194.729s">[Collins]</a>: And I think lots of constituents would be really eager to see the city council take on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7200.171s">[Collins]</a>: a more bullish approach to advocating for anti-racist dialogue, as well as, you know, as counselors have said, policies that address structural inequities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7213.042s">[Collins]</a>: So just to sum up, you know, I agree, we all have the responsibility to start these conversations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7218.687s">[Collins]</a>: And I think that, you know, we need to be creating spaces where people feel, everybody can feel comfortable<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7227.912s">[Collins]</a>: talking about these issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7229.072s">[Collins]</a>: And if we're observing the fact that we don't yet have perfect communication about these issues, I think that we also have to consider that the fact of white supremacy and racial divide is a reason for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7241.075s">[Collins]</a>: So thank you for the opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1082.193s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, and thank you Councilor Caraviello for bringing this forward today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1085.777s">[Collins]</a>: I think this resolution is important, obviously we need to make sure that every city vehicle is a safe vehicle, and I support measures to ensure that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1094.906s">[Collins]</a>: I also want to thank Councilor Tseng and President Morell for their<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1100.157s">[Collins]</a>: amendments, you know, of course, as we all know, resources are finite, needs are many, so I support, you know, I'd be interested to see this purchase plan, a phased in purchasing plan in the context of an overall capital budget, just to see how it interacts with other funding priorities, including other funding priorities within the MPD, which I know are many at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1121.772s">[Collins]</a>: I also wanted to note, you know, kind of to President Murrell's point, of course, yearly vehicle purchases, even if they're phased in, they're no small thing environmentally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1130.395s">[Collins]</a>: And, you know, there is a huge emissions cost baked into high volume vehicle manufacturing, you know, even for EV vehicles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1136.157s">[Collins]</a>: So regardless of how this goes forward, obviously, patrol cars are a bit of a non-negotiable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1141.86s">[Collins]</a>: But I think that that's something that I'd really like to see acknowledged and accounted for in our overall path to net zero emissions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1147.883s">[Collins]</a>: So just wanted to note that for the record, regardless of how we go forward, I think that'd be a valuable thing for us to, for the administration to consider in their purchase plan of these vehicles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1156.206s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1637.019s">[Collins]</a>: I was also just seconding but I agree with everything and I'd said I think these are four extremely worthy projects, very excited to support them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1844.1s">[Collins]</a>: Mr. President, if I may, motion to take from the table papers 21631 and 22023 for the purpose of surgery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1852.805s">[Collins]</a>: Those aren't eligible till next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1854.546s">[Collins]</a>: Next week?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1864.839s">[Collins]</a>: It's already February in my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1314.52s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1317.403s">[Collins]</a>: I'd support the motion to move this to a committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1319.745s">[Collins]</a>: I think Councilor Scarpelli raises a point that I've heard from multiple sources that, you know, our best chance for passing a home rule petition for charter review is to pass it with unanimous vote from the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1331.416s">[Collins]</a>: You know, respectfully, I hope that we're able to get to seven zero because as, you know, as Councilor Scarpelli, as President Morell already said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1339.924s">[Collins]</a>: It's been a long, long time since we've reviewed this foundational code of our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1345.891s">[Collins]</a>: I've heard from a lot of constituents just over the past week about this and a lot more ever since I started campaigning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1353.0s">[Collins]</a>: I think this is a really top priority issue for a lot of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1357.23s">[Collins]</a>: who live in Medford, you know, one raised, I think, you know, perhaps the most salient point of all, which is, you know, any important binding legal document, it's a good idea to review it every once in a while, kind of like we're currently doing with our code of zoning ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1371.619s">[Collins]</a>: To me, there's simply no reason not to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1374.641s">[Collins]</a>: And, you know, this home rule petition is just to the question of, do we give Medford an opportunity to review that charter or not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1382.026s">[Collins]</a>: it's not, you know, we're not weighing in on what should come out of that Charter Review Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1386.029s">[Collins]</a>: So, you know, I hope that we can take steps to give a strong vote on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1390.973s">[Collins]</a>: And, you know, I know I'll be voting in favor and excited to present this opportunity to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3622.128s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you and thank you President we're all we're putting this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3624.71s">[Collins]</a>: I want to concur with a lot of counselors have really just said, I also just want to note I think that this is a problem that's felt differently in different neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3632.317s">[Collins]</a>: I live in South Medford renter most people on my street are renters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3636.061s">[Collins]</a>: I think that this is a very I think that you know the parking enforcement during snowstorms is felt really differently like depending on the character of a neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3644.228s">[Collins]</a>: A lot of my neighbors did not move their cars because they had no idea that we're having a snow emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3651.037s">[Collins]</a>: I've had people reaching out to me on Twitter to ask about parking policies and I think if people are reaching out to little old me on Twitter it's because they have no idea where to look for that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3660.689s">[Collins]</a>: I can sympathize because as a digital native almost, as a millennial, I struggled a couple of years ago to find where to sign up for city alerts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3669.516s">[Collins]</a>: And I'm probably about as plugged into city stuff as anybody in my age group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3674.12s">[Collins]</a>: So I agree, I think this should be coordinated with other citywide communications because I think the need for signage, and I do think there are some neighborhoods where it would be kind of the only thing that people see about it, shows that we have a pretty big communication gap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3689.173s">[Collins]</a>: in our city for alerts like this in general.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4467.401s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4467.701s">[Collins]</a>: And thank you, President Morell for putting this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4470.224s">[Collins]</a>: I'd certainly second your motion for approval if there's a motion already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4474.087s">[Collins]</a>: I think that it's a good idea to put this forward, you know, regardless of the recent change in the proposal, you know, as articulated by councilors already, the plan has changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4482.395s">[Collins]</a>: I think it's a good idea for us to say in one voice as a council, you know, we need to stand up for the spirit of the Community Benefits Agreement that Wynne entered into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4490.342s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4892.175s">[Collins]</a>: I'll be brief, but as a person who in my other work,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4897.748s">[Collins]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4900.069s">[Collins]</a>: What was that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4901.99s">[Collins]</a>: Oh, wait, is that a rule?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4909.734s">[Collins]</a>: Well, you made me lose my train of thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4911.175s">[Collins]</a>: I was going to say, thank you, Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4917.461s">[Collins]</a>: As a person who does public art professionally, I thank Councilor Tseng for bringing this forward and I agree, you know, from my own experience and from talking to other people in the field, you know, public art can really seem like a black box to people, you know, amateur artists, professionals who are trying to get into the field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4933.049s">[Collins]</a>: I also think that with so many other things, equity is a huge issue in the public art field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4938.598s">[Collins]</a>: you know, anything that we can do to further our efforts to be transparent about the process can help more people in the community both take on these opportunities and also weigh in on what kind of public art we wanna see in our community and where, so I think it's a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6166.219s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6333.68s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6335.541s">[Collins]</a>: I would like to move to approve this measure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6337.982s">[Collins]</a>: I was pleased to testify in favor of H3080 a couple of weeks ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6341.923s">[Collins]</a>: I think it's an extremely important set of bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6344.765s">[Collins]</a>: They just provide a local option for municipalities to receive a more fair compensation rate from their large resident nonprofits, as we're all very aware.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6354.909s">[Collins]</a>: Municipalities bear a very heavy governmental load for the amount of resources that they're able to command.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6361.291s">[Collins]</a>: And these bills will help straighten our city municipalities like ours by providing a framework for wealthy resident nonprofits to pay their fair share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6369.555s">[Collins]</a>: So I think it would be a great idea for this council to send a strong message to the state delegation of, you know, what an asset this framework would be to communities like ours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6378.74s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6965.568s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6969.648s">[Collins]</a>: enthusiastic readers of the Massachusetts Municipal Association weekly newsletter already now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6976.432s">[Collins]</a>: We are predicted to have a huge uptick in state tax collections for the upcoming fiscal year compared to the current one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6983.375s">[Collins]</a>: It's a particularly dramatic increase compared to original projections for the fiscal year 2022 tax collections forecast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6990.399s">[Collins]</a>: And even if you only consider the calculation of the tax base that was used to actually create<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6995.361s">[Collins]</a>: the fiscal year 2022 state budget, it's still over a 7% increase from that number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7000.163s">[Collins]</a>: Meanwhile, the level of state aid afforded to municipalities barely keeps pace with inflation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7008.227s">[Collins]</a>: Again, I wanna note how the past couple of years have highlighted just how much responsibility for policy and governance rests at the most local level of governance, particularly when it comes to public health, resiliency, roads, environmental maintenance, really essential services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7023.473s">[Collins]</a>: that we need to not only maintain but actually expand if we're going to do right by our community and our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7029.934s">[Collins]</a>: So I hope that ours and other municipalities can successfully communicate to our state leaders the need to increase the level of local aid in next year's state budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7039.536s">[Collins]</a>: I hope that other municipalities will join with ours, hopefully, in advocating for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7044.537s">[Collins]</a>: And I respectfully ask for my fellow councilors' support in advocating this to our state leaders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7050.458s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7159.551s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7161.513s">[Collins]</a>: So as many folks are no doubt already aware, February 3rd and 4th marked the two-year anniversary of our city's pledge to become hunger-free by 2028.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7173.065s">[Collins]</a>: Really grateful to the school committee, city council that were in effect at the time in 2020, as well as Mayor Lungo-Koehn for making this commitment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7181.613s">[Collins]</a>: And also, you know, just want to express gratitude for the members and collaborators of the Medford Food Security Task Force for their work behind the scenes raising this issue of food security in Medford, you know, both prior to the pledge and, you know, in the time after it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7196.862s">[Collins]</a>: As everybody who's working on the issue of hunger and food insecurity and Medford, you know, knows as well as anybody, there's a lot of work that we still have to do to reach the goal of actually being, you know, free of hunger and food insecurity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7209.905s">[Collins]</a>: in the next six years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7212.167s">[Collins]</a>: We've had some great gains, the Mystic Community Market being among them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7215.469s">[Collins]</a>: There's still a very far way to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7219.093s">[Collins]</a>: So, especially given that budget season is, you know, going to be upon us before we know it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7224.135s">[Collins]</a>: I just think that this is an opportunity for us to state that this is a very strong priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7228.036s">[Collins]</a>: There's no quick fixes when it comes to eradicating the issue of hunger.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7232.658s">[Collins]</a>: But we need to, you know, invest what needs to be invested convene the groups and conversations that need to be convened to figure out what exactly are the obstacles to eradicating hunger in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7242.361s">[Collins]</a>: and then, you know, hopefully make haste to do the work of the economic development and programs and policies that will make going hungry in Medford a thing of the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7251.264s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for your consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7481.095s">[Collins]</a>: If I may, motion to take from the table papers 21-631, second 21-631, and 22-023.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7483.638s">[Collins]</a>: On the motion of Councilor Collins, same papers 21-631, 21-631, and 20-... Sorry, one second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8087.953s">[Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=338.329s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=514.137s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=542.066s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=299.882s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=323.136s">[Collins]</a>: I would move to table to the next regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=326.318s">[Collins]</a>: On the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=326.939s">[Collins]</a>: I didn't have a chance to review them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=378.52s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President bears and I'd also like to thank Vice Chair of the committee Matt Leming for chairing this meeting on my behalf at this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=386.522s">[Collins]</a>: The draft proposal for the green score ordinance was reviewed by the committee and reported out to a regular session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=391.764s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=392.304s">[Collins]</a>: I move to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=579.316s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1372.989s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1927.403s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1928.444s">[Collins]</a>: I just wanted to quickly thank Director Blake and his team for their work with Blue Bikes here to for in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1937.731s">[Collins]</a>: And I understand that this requested contract extension is part of a kind of coordinated regional effort so that not just an effort, but that in more of our adjacent communities, people can have an easier time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1951.162s">[Collins]</a>: the bike share network and using that not only to get in and around Medford, but to surrounding communities and back for play and for commuting and for other purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1961.249s">[Collins]</a>: So I'm happy to be a part of the effort of streamlining that process in Medford and beyond, and I would motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1968.215s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2186.218s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1006.279s">[Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3753.721s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3754.562s">[Collins]</a>: Can folks hear me okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3757.105s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3758.286s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3759.027s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3760.909s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you to the assessor and his team for this presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3765.478s">[Collins]</a>: I will say I have a much easier time with this presentation now that it's my third time receiving it than the first couple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3770.481s">[Collins]</a>: So thank you, as always, for walking us through these technical and really important concepts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3779.007s">[Collins]</a>: I certainly appreciate the discussion around the residential exemption as I do every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3783.689s">[Collins]</a>: And this is something that we have a really, I think, nuanced and important conversation every year around this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3792.074s">[Collins]</a>: Because we want to consider, you know, this tool is a tool that exists, it's appropriate for some communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3796.617s">[Collins]</a>: And I think it's really important to consider, is it something that would be appropriate for Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3802.32s">[Collins]</a>: Is it something that would be appropriate for Medford now or in the future?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3806.141s">[Collins]</a>: What's that point at which kind of similar to the break-even point that we have to consider that the residential exemption itself would create?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3814.386s">[Collins]</a>: And I think for me, you know, based on the data that's been presented,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3818.482s">[Collins]</a>: Where I come down is similar to in previous years when we hear about that breakeven point we know that a residential exemption would benefit a lot of people who really deserve it, and we know that it would disadvantage a lot of people that would also really deserve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3828.83s">[Collins]</a>: And I think that we should absolutely continue to gather more information about what exactly this would mean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3834.194s">[Collins]</a>: for our community and as, you know, the character of our parcels evolves gradually each year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3840.477s">[Collins]</a>: But it's so important to get this right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3843.279s">[Collins]</a>: And, you know, as we know from other parts of this discussion, you know, those little changes make a really big difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3849.342s">[Collins]</a>: And so I don't have any specific questions on the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3853.304s">[Collins]</a>: But I would just say, you know, kind of on that point of where can we do<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3857.998s">[Collins]</a>: where can we help legislate for the most benefit and the most help to our residents as we're contemplating the split in the tax limit?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3868.183s">[Collins]</a>: You know, for as long as I've been on the council, and I think for longer before that, we have adopted the maximum split rate, which shifts the burden onto commercial, industrial, and personal property, and maximally, as allowed by state law, away from residential properties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3883.791s">[Collins]</a>: And after discussion,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3886.392s">[Collins]</a>: I'm a fellow councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3887.233s">[Collins]</a>: I certainly don't want to rush this discussion along, but I would be happy to make a motion to adopt the split rate of 175% so that we can continue to shift the tax burden maximally away from residential taxpayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3901.785s">[Collins]</a>: Thanks again, Ted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4564.602s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4663.541s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4697.953s">[Collins]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4713.121s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5735.4s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5783.964s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=387.148s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=388.809s">[Collins]</a>: I'm excited to be able to say congratulations to you all in person, state champs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=393.312s">[Collins]</a>: Wow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=393.712s">[Collins]</a>: That is really amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=395.233s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for all of your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=398.194s">[Collins]</a>: I lived with a rower during college and they have to be the fittest athletes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=401.636s">[Collins]</a>: I can't believe how early you guys must wake up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=403.738s">[Collins]</a>: So just our heartiest congratulations on this really major achievement and for doing Medford proud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=409.461s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1141.433s">[Collins]</a>: Motion to take resolutions under suspension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1145.556s">[Collins]</a>: Oh, motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1159.725s">[Collins]</a>: Motion to take resolutions under suspension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2222.462s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2223.844s">[Collins]</a>: So I'm motioning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2225.225s">[Collins]</a>: Motioning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2226.486s">[Collins]</a>: Is that right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2226.946s">[Collins]</a>: Moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2227.487s">[Collins]</a>: Moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2228.217s">[Collins]</a>: God, I knew that didn't sound right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2230.639s">[Collins]</a>: Geez.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2232.221s">[Collins]</a>: Anyway, I am moving to send the existing Community Control of Public Surveillance Ordinance, which was passed last term, to the Public Health and Community Safety Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2244.791s">[Collins]</a>: This ordinance was crafted and collaborated on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2247.954s">[Collins]</a>: in the previous term because the city, the council, and residents had a shared concern and a shared interest in the civil liberties of residents, transparency in our governmental decisions, and a shared interest in making sure that our very precious city dollars are spent on true public safety and not on expensive gadgets and softwares that enrich corporations more than they actually help communities and residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2273.663s">[Collins]</a>: So to that end, some residents have identified potential changes that we could make to this rather new ordinance that would make it even stronger and even more in line with those shared goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2284.072s">[Collins]</a>: So I look forward to reviewing those comments, perhaps making some tweaks and having this discussion in committee where we can really get into the details and make this even stronger than it already is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2295.761s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2313.418s">[Collins]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2370.513s">[Collins]</a>: To continue the public hearing to our next regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3314.774s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3316.055s">[Collins]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro, thank you so much for putting this forward and to all of the collaborators from the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3321.3s">[Collins]</a>: I know that we have been hearing from safety advocates in the community for a long time about this, and I'm glad that we're doing this one small step towards a potential solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3335.252s">[Collins]</a>: I think this one is really simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3336.573s">[Collins]</a>: You know, we have a 25 mile per hour speed limit on city managed roads for a reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3343.498s">[Collins]</a>: We struggle to maintain and enforce that speed limit on city roads as it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3348.523s">[Collins]</a>: I heard a couple speeding complaints from residents twice in the past two days, and that was before the meeting started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3354.447s">[Collins]</a>: And then we heard about more traffic issues on Salem, about the lack of safety on Salem Street as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3359.812s">[Collins]</a>: So we really need the state's help in creating a culture of safe road speeds here in Medford and around the region, because it's just intuitive, you know, people whip on the roads in Medford, they whip on the state roads, and they bring that speed to the neighborhoods, and it's incredibly dangerous, it's incredibly scary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3377.142s">[Collins]</a>: So I hope that this will send a really clear message to DCR and DOT that Medford wants this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3386.731s">[Collins]</a>: We do not want this fast traffic from these state roads bleeding into the neighborhoods anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3392.436s">[Collins]</a>: So thank you so much for putting this together and thank you so much to everybody in the community who's been raising the alarm about this as well for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=226.674s">[Collins]</a>: Oh, we're in trouble then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=229.416s">[Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=229.976s">[Collins]</a>: Is it on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=232.177s">[Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=239.32s">[Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=247.083s">[Collins]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=247.504s">[Collins]</a>: I haven't been chair before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=257.286s">[Collins]</a>: It's on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=257.846s">[Collins]</a>: Oh, it is on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=258.426s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=261.927s">[Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=262.787s">[Collins]</a>: Can you turn your microphone on as a test?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=280.762s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=281.823s">[Collins]</a>: That I recall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=299.913s">[Collins]</a>: Can folks is this picking up my voice at all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=303.875s">[Collins]</a>: Not really.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=345.151s">[Collins]</a>: Okay, I think I'm on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=346.372s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=422.981s">[Collins]</a>: So we've had a busy past couple months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=425.722s">[Collins]</a>: We have referred the Mystic Avenue Corridor District zoning proposal to the CDB.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=430.303s">[Collins]</a>: Same with Greenscore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=432.503s">[Collins]</a>: So we are kind of in the middle of our discussions, kind of beginning<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=437.004s">[Collins]</a>: middle of the beginning, beginning of the middle of our discussions about the zoning proposal for the Salem Street Corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=444.731s">[Collins]</a>: We touched on that a little bit last time when Vice Chair Leming was presiding over the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=449.575s">[Collins]</a>: The purpose of tonight's meeting is to kind of recenter ourselves and where we are in the timeline of the zoning review project overall, where we are in the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=460.836s">[Collins]</a>: and place the Salem Street zoning proposal in the context of that, its next steps after the committee takes its time with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=468.883s">[Collins]</a>: And then we're going to have an introduction to the Salem Street Corridor zoning proposal by NS Associates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=475.888s">[Collins]</a>: This is just the first time that the council and the committee is going to have a chance to kind of get a really solid comprehensive overview and start to get into the weeds on this zoning proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=487.739s">[Collins]</a>: We've already started advertising for our next planning and permitting committee meeting where we'll be going over the Salem Street zoning proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=496.607s">[Collins]</a>: That's going to be next week on Wednesday at our regular time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=499.554s">[Collins]</a>: I understand that in collaboration with Director Hunt and the mayor's office, we put out some promotional materials about this meeting today on social media, as well as a robocall just to make sure that we're really getting the word out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=512.298s">[Collins]</a>: So the purpose of tonight is to introduce this proposal to councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=516.06s">[Collins]</a>: I know we've had it in our packets since last week so that we can start to make those comments and ask those questions so that we can be kind of having more informed context for residents in the week between now and next week when we talk about it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=528.344s">[Collins]</a>: And again, invite residents to hear about the proposal and ask questions before the committee takes any further action on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=535.928s">[Collins]</a>: So with that, I'll turn it over unless Danielle or Alicia, if you have any comments that you want to make up top, I'd happily turn it over to Paola to begin her presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=558.725s">[Collins]</a>: Oh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=564.5s">[Collins]</a>: Sorry, one second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1450.814s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1452.075s">[Collins]</a>: Please go ahead, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1916.633s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Emily and Paola for that overview really appreciate that appreciate you know the I was appreciate getting walked through the zoning proposals even reading them ahead of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1927.343s">[Collins]</a>: It's not the same as having a professional zoning planner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1934.023s">[Collins]</a>: define what we're looking at for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1936.744s">[Collins]</a>: Appreciate that, and especially since we've gone through the Mystic Avenue corridor district zoning proposal already, I appreciate kind of the heads up about what we'll see in those sub-districts, where the sub-districts have the same name, but what they mean in Salem Street will be a little bit different, or maybe a lot different than what they mean for Mystic Ave, because Mystic Ave and Salem Street are so different, and what we want to do in those two districts is very different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1958.735s">[Collins]</a>: responsive to, you know, what they are and what they represent in the community and what people do there and what the neighbors want there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1965.902s">[Collins]</a>: So thank you so much for for calling that out kind of at the beginning of this conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1971.687s">[Collins]</a>: I know we've had some time to look over this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1977.292s">[Collins]</a>: I think, you know, for me, what stands out to me from the presentation so far is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1984.628s">[Collins]</a>: You know, when I was looking at this prior to the presentation, looking at, you know, where do we have mixed one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1990.992s">[Collins]</a>: Where do we have mixed two?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1992.693s">[Collins]</a>: Where do we have commercial and why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1994.194s">[Collins]</a>: It makes a lot of sense to me to cluster mixed use close to those intersections that are already, you see a lot of foot traffic, you see a lot of all kinds of traffic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2005.301s">[Collins]</a>: There's already really thriving businesses there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2007.882s">[Collins]</a>: We want to enhance that thriving business character at those places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2012.505s">[Collins]</a>: And I really appreciated seeing that some blocks are left mixed use one, we can keep that concentration on residential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2020.41s">[Collins]</a>: I really appreciated kind of the thoughtfulness with first defining, you know, Salem Street is a really big neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2027.115s">[Collins]</a>: We're not talking about Reno re sorry we're not talking about rezoning the neighborhood here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2031.577s">[Collins]</a>: We're talking about rezoning this quarter so I appreciate the thought that was given to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2035.86s">[Collins]</a>: How many parcels, you know, north and south of Salem are we really talking about when it comes to those key intersections what should be at those intersections and when does it taper off back into residential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2046.548s">[Collins]</a>: And then what I think is really key and I think something that's really bothered a lot of residents for a lot of time is, what do we need to do to make Haines Square, more we want it to be and start using those big parcels in a way that will be more, more of an advantage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2060.298s">[Collins]</a>: for the folks who live around there and shop there and just want to see more for the community in that space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2067.183s">[Collins]</a>: So with that being said, appreciate the thoughtfulness to the existing character, existing heights and trying to update the zoning to enhance the existing residential business character and make it more of what we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2080.171s">[Collins]</a>: I'll go now to comments and questions from the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2083.813s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2085.014s">[Collins]</a>: We'll do public presentation at the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2086.375s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2088.215s">[Collins]</a>: Comments from fellow city councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2093.7s">[Collins]</a>: Oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2096.222s">[Collins]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2099.344s">[Collins]</a>: President Paris.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2259.824s">[Collins]</a>: Great, thank you so much, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2261.425s">[Collins]</a>: I'll move up here so I can actually see my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2263.787s">[Collins]</a>: We'll go now to Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2268.151s">[Collins]</a>: Did I do it right this time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2275.497s">[Collins]</a>: No, I did not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2275.977s">[Collins]</a>: You're number eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2276.558s">[Collins]</a>: My apologies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2569.673s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2570.993s">[Collins]</a>: I'll go to you next, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2573.634s">[Collins]</a>: Just want to echo Councilor Scarpelli's words, you know, really appreciate the collaboration to bring this out to the community and to kind of bring in all of the public engagement that's been done over the past several years into this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2589.079s">[Collins]</a>: I know it's tough, you know, I think with every project that we do, it's like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2593.42s">[Collins]</a>: that does involve collaboration with the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2596.082s">[Collins]</a>: There's always part of me that's like, no, it's really, let's take five years to do, let's take 10 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2600.205s">[Collins]</a>: Let's talk to everyone, let's canvas the neighborhood, talk to every single person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2603.647s">[Collins]</a>: Unfortunately, this contract does not cover that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2606.85s">[Collins]</a>: And I was taking some time to re-read over the RFP as I was looking over the presentation this past weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2611.693s">[Collins]</a>: We know what we do have your support for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2614.755s">[Collins]</a>: It's not a new comprehensive plan for Salem Street, but we do have this bringing in what we know from the comprehensive plan of the three years that it took to put that together into this proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2623.785s">[Collins]</a>: I know that in the RFP it mentioned as well, you know, a workshop in City Hall dealing with the neighborhood and we had kind of a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2632.613s">[Collins]</a>: One version of that a few months ago with the zoning workshop before we got into the corridors in the neighborhoods and supplementing that with, you know, online meetings for the public for the benefit of the public, bringing the public into these meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2643.821s">[Collins]</a>: So I know for myself as one counselor, I've been really glad that Steve from the mayor's office was able to help us out with shoring up our communication strategy to make sure that we're using the robocalls to get this out over more channels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2655.449s">[Collins]</a>: I'm also going to hold myself accountable to do what I can on my own personal counselor communication channels to make sure this tries to reach<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2662.433s">[Collins]</a>: everybody that it can, and to keep doing that with every neighborhood and corridor that we do discuss over the next six months so really appreciate those comments and you know, let's do it we can behind the rail to supplement these coordinated public engagement strategies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2676.842s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for indulging me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2883.055s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2883.655s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2884.115s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Hillion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2885.176s">[Collins]</a>: Alicia, did you have a direct response to that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2888.677s">[Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2889.538s">[Collins]</a>: And then I'll go to you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2956.057s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2958.159s">[Collins]</a>: President Bears, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3024.705s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3025.645s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3026.786s">[Collins]</a>: And yeah, I think it's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3030.498s">[Collins]</a>: I think to the extent that we can, you know, as soon as there are questions and comments, whether it's from counselors, as we continue to look through the draft, as we look through the updated amended draft that we'll see next week, and as soon as there are questions and comments from constituents, whether it's at this meeting next Wednesday, in between the two, you want to contact any of the counselors or myself as chair, and I can certainly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3051.548s">[Collins]</a>: ferry questions along to NS associates or the planning team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3055.171s">[Collins]</a>: It's, it's very okay and good to front loads those questions as much as possible so that they can be considered and incorporated earlier in the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3062.376s">[Collins]</a>: But the great thing about amending the zoning ordinance is that procedurally we have to have so many meetings on it, even after it gets referred out of committee where we'll have lots of like in the weeds conversations like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3073.023s">[Collins]</a>: So thank you for reminding us all about all the steps that come after this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3078.545s">[Collins]</a>: So speaking of next steps in terms of potential changes that might be made on the zoning consultant side for next week, I heard that there's going to be some typos in the parking table that might be tweaked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3092.468s">[Collins]</a>: Can we expect to see a more finalized version of the inclusion and the incentive zoning that might apply to next use one and two by next week as well?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3100.991s">[Collins]</a>: Or is that going to come later?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3134.918s">[Collins]</a>: Excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3135.559s">[Collins]</a>: So next week we can expect more discussion on this proposal to stay more finessed and some typos removed version of this Salem Street zoning proposal and that's next Wednesday 6pm our regular meeting time for this planning and permitting committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3150.254s">[Collins]</a>: I'd like to go to public participation unless there are any more questions or comments from councillors at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3157.702s">[Collins]</a>: Seeing none, we can start in person then I'll go on zoom so you can just walk up and form a line behind microphone and everybody has three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3166.226s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3168.947s">[Collins]</a>: My first name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3299.805s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for your comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3301.166s">[Collins]</a>: I don't want to go point by point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3303.707s">[Collins]</a>: I appreciate you putting this all on the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3305.568s">[Collins]</a>: I will say, if you want to have a really close look at where certain heights are enabled and where other heights are enabled, the proposal that the consultant showed on the screen, that's available on the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3322.475s">[Collins]</a>: No, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3322.755s">[Collins]</a>: I mean, you can go on your own time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3323.936s">[Collins]</a>: You can pull it up and you can take a really fine tooth comb and look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3326.498s">[Collins]</a>: I will just say, I know that a lot of the potential heights, minimum heights, maximum heights are based on the heights that are already present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3339.146s">[Collins]</a>: Gotcha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3339.386s">[Collins]</a>: Well, I'd say this, feel free to send me an email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3342.768s">[Collins]</a>: I will download them and send them right back to you so that you can take a look.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3364.872s">[Collins]</a>: I don't want to go back and forth with you with the people who are waiting, but I will just say I think Salem Street matches the characteristics of other parts of the city that have this mix of residential, thriving businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3374.615s">[Collins]</a>: It's a main thoroughfare.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3376.215s">[Collins]</a>: I think a lot of care is being taken to make sure that it preserves its residential character while supporting businesses and businesses that want to take root on that corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3407.026s">[Collins]</a>: Gotcha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3407.786s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for your comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3408.847s">[Collins]</a>: Appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3409.367s">[Collins]</a>: You have to go to the next person now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3410.887s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3411.128s">[Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3412.788s">[Collins]</a>: We're going to switch between podium and Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3415.149s">[Collins]</a>: So thank you for waiting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3415.95s">[Collins]</a>: We're going to go first to Dave on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3419.271s">[Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3483.046s">[Collins]</a>: Great, thank you, Dave Peller Emily, could you quickly speak to the characteristics of the commercial if there's any.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3490.331s">[Collins]</a>: residential involved in commercial sub district in Salem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3538.749s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3539.149s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Paula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3539.749s">[Collins]</a>: And Dave, to your first question, I think that the incentive zoning, I believe, is already drafted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3545.57s">[Collins]</a>: That was part of the Mystic Avenue corridor proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3547.531s">[Collins]</a>: So it looks like that's going to look pretty much the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3550.291s">[Collins]</a>: I think the characteristics-wise, it's just what that minimum and maximum height would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3553.532s">[Collins]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3593.174s">[Collins]</a>: Well, thank you, Paolo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3593.974s">[Collins]</a>: Yeah, in short, it's kind of that exchange between what we're willing to say, hey, ordinarily you can't do this, but if you provide this great community benefit that we've decided is highly valuable and residents really want, then you're able to do a little bit more than developers ordinarily can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3608.359s">[Collins]</a>: That's incentive zoning in a nutshell, and page 15 and 16 of tonight's agenda, if you want to take a closer look.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3615.287s">[Collins]</a>: We'll go now to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3743.923s">[Collins]</a>: All right, we're going to toggle back to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3749.848s">[Collins]</a>: Rebecca, name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3751.69s">[Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3752.691s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3866.892s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3867.253s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for your comments, Rebecca.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3868.593s">[Collins]</a>: We'll now return to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3869.853s">[Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3871.074s">[Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3904.73s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you very much for your comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3906.671s">[Collins]</a>: We'll go down back to zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3916.867s">[Collins]</a>: Is there any more?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3917.707s">[Collins]</a>: Oh, it's back up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3919.068s">[Collins]</a>: Spoke too soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3919.908s">[Collins]</a>: Jennifer, name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3921.309s">[Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3923.67s">[Collins]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3962.165s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you very much for your comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3963.465s">[Collins]</a>: Director Hunt, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4085.151s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Alicia, and thank you so much, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4087.892s">[Collins]</a>: I think that's a great reminder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4088.972s">[Collins]</a>: I think it's something that I remind myself throughout this process, even though we've been talking in quite a lot of depth about zoning, you know, for more than a full calendar year now, is that zoning is counterintuitive because it seems like we're talking about what's going to happen when we're talking about what's going to be allowed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4104.398s">[Collins]</a>: And I think Salem Street is a really great example, and there are examples all over Medford, but it's a great example of where what is currently there<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4112.601s">[Collins]</a>: might be allowed under our current zoning, or maybe not, and we're having a conversation about what that's currently there, do we still want to be allowed, and we're done with this, but we'd not want to be allowed, like, I think there's broad consensus against the 12-story hotel, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4125.305s">[Collins]</a>: I think everybody's in favor of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4127.165s">[Collins]</a>: And what do we want to be allowed that isn't allowed currently, so that the businesses are there, are even more thriving, that the residences are there, it's an even cozier neighborhood for the folks that live there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4137.989s">[Collins]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4177.428s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for that clarification, Councilor Galleon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4181.27s">[Collins]</a>: Seeing no further public participation on Zoom or in person and no further questions or comments from Councilors, we do have a regular meeting to get started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4188.735s">[Collins]</a>: So just to once again restate our next steps, we're going to be talking about this exact zoning proposal again next Wednesday at 6 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4196.759s">[Collins]</a>: Please feel free to help us in spreading the word and we're glad to have the collaboration of the mayor's office and spreading the word on social media and through robo calls to residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4206.304s">[Collins]</a>: You know, this process has been informed by the past several years of public participation on what they like and what they want to see for Salem Street and other areas around the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4215.309s">[Collins]</a>: and these conversations, you know, in the here and now have to be informed by all of our voices as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4221.071s">[Collins]</a>: So thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4221.792s">[Collins]</a>: So we're going to see this 6 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4224.653s">[Collins]</a>: next Wednesday, whenever it gets referred out to the City Council, it will then be referred to the Community Development Board, and then it will be referred back to the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4232.596s">[Collins]</a>: And I just say that over and over again every meeting to remind you of all of the opportunities that we welcome you to be a part of this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4242.16s">[Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4242.46s">[Collins]</a>: 7-12, do we have a motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4247.421s">[Collins]</a>: Motion to adjourn by President Bexar, seconded by Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4251.167s">[Collins]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4251.728s">[Collins]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4252.97s">[Collins]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4254.232s">[Collins]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4254.873s">[Collins]</a>: Meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4255.594s">[Collins]</a>: Please stick around for the regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4257.136s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Innocent Associates, Danielle, and Alicia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=408.459s">[Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=410.06s">[Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=411.08s">[Collins]</a>: Am I on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=411.821s">[Collins]</a>: Okay, cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=412.181s">[Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=413.421s">[Collins]</a>: Everybody ready?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=423.206s">[Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=424.026s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for bearing with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=425.067s">[Collins]</a>: There will be a meeting of the Medford City Council Planning and Permitting Committee, December 11th, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=433.39s">[Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=448.916s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=449.196s">[Collins]</a>: Present five present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=451.618s">[Collins]</a>: None absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=452.459s">[Collins]</a>: The meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=454.061s">[Collins]</a>: The action discussion item for this meeting is once again 24 dash 033 zoning ordinance updates with the Ennis associates team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=463.99s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=465.051s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, City staff for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=466.812s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you to members of the public for joining us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=470.795s">[Collins]</a>: This is, I believe, the 16th, the agenda says, the 16th Zoning Updates Project Meeting with Innes Associates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=477.658s">[Collins]</a>: This week we are again talking about the Salem Street Corridor Zoning Proposal discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=483.62s">[Collins]</a>: We touched on this topic last week, last Tuesday as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=486.881s">[Collins]</a>: Really glad to be talking about this with you all again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=489.482s">[Collins]</a>: I'm just going to briefly reintroduce this specific topic and then I'll hand it over to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=498.026s">[Collins]</a>: and we'll have a presentation by Ennis Associates and commentary by city staff, and then we'll proceed with our discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=506.533s">[Collins]</a>: But just to quickly reintroduce what we're talking about today, this is our second time having a full meeting devoted to the Salem Street Corridor District.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=517.243s">[Collins]</a>: This is just one part of the City Council's systemic review and update of citywide zoning over the course of this term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=523.628s">[Collins]</a>: We've been working with Ennis Associates, thank you for being here, which also assisted the city on the years-long comprehensive plan process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=533.337s">[Collins]</a>: So this corridor proposal, like other aspects of the zoning project, have been crafted by Ennis in consultation with, oh, thank you for letting me know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=551.454s">[Collins]</a>: So these zoning proposals crafted by the zoning consultant in consultation with this committee and city staff, all of these are guided by citywide goals and community feedback as articulated in the comprehensive plan, the housing production plan, the climate action and adaptation plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=566.936s">[Collins]</a>: and the community input and feedback that we're very fortunate to have throughout this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=572.558s">[Collins]</a>: And just because I take every opportunity to say this, after these proposals leave this committee, they go back to the city council, they then are procedurally must be referred to the community development board for their review and recommendations, and then come back to the city council once again, before those votes to ordain are taken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=591.584s">[Collins]</a>: It's a complicated process, so I like to repeat it as often as possible, because I know it took me a while to internalize it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=597.581s">[Collins]</a>: So like I said, the initial draft of the Salem Street corridor zoning proposal was presented to this committee on December 3rd for some initial feedback, questions and comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=607.585s">[Collins]</a>: The project proposes new zoning for the corridor along Salem Street, which includes the roughly two to four parcels extending north and south of Salem Street, beginning at the Route 60 roundabout and extending up to Haines Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=619.21s">[Collins]</a>: So this proposal does not include the greater Salem Street neighborhood outside of those boundaries, though of course it does touch them and is adjacent to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=628.971s">[Collins]</a>: for getting further into the weeds than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=632.053s">[Collins]</a>: I will pass it off to Ennis Associates for a presentation, which I understand we saw a really similar presentation to this last week, but I think you're going to highlight some of the tweaks and changes that have been incorporated since last week based on feedback that we got from the community as well as feedback from councilors and city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=650.426s">[Collins]</a>: Before I turn it over, any initial comments or questions from councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=656.63s">[Collins]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=766.02s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=2924.99s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for the presentation, Paola and Emily really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=2930.575s">[Collins]</a>: I'll echo what you said this is a lot to take in zoning always is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=2933.978s">[Collins]</a>: I think that's one of our challenges here is this is a zoning is never not going to be technical complicated veering into wonky and confusing so I appreciate you doing your very best to break it down for counselors members of the public, whether we're seeing it for the third time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=2952.621s">[Collins]</a>: like councillors are for the first time as some members of the public, maybe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=2955.743s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=2957.905s">[Collins]</a>: Lots to delve into here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=2958.826s">[Collins]</a>: I'll go first to any comments or questions from my fellow councillors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=2966.233s">[Collins]</a>: And Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=2990.451s">[Collins]</a>: Want to speak to the citywide parking strategy we're thinking about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3133.727s">[Collins]</a>: Did you have a follow-up to that, Councilor Lohmann?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3144.53s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3144.81s">[Collins]</a>: Or President Beres, I'll go to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3183.341s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3187.344s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3188.464s">[Collins]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3374.631s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3375.792s">[Collins]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3376.772s">[Collins]</a>: And before I turn it over to Ines to respond, it looks like there is a response percolating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3383.036s">[Collins]</a>: Just before this meeting,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3386.772s">[Collins]</a>: began, we were talking about more ways that we can continue to expand the use of diagrams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3391.435s">[Collins]</a>: And I know this isn't exactly what you're proposing, but kind of that ongoing theme of what else can we include apart from just the text to convey what we're talking about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3400.22s">[Collins]</a>: Because even as one councillor who talks about this as much as anybody else behind the rail, it still takes a lot of effort to understand what we're talking about and break it down and paraphrase it in ways that people can understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3411.566s">[Collins]</a>: I certainly sympathize with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3413.607s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for bringing it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3433.55s">[Collins]</a>: Yeah, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3434.11s">[Collins]</a>: I think that that's something that I want us to continue to explore, and that if that's something that council leadership can help support NS Associates on, because I know you're doing the lion's share of the work in putting together the complicated proposal, which is legally required, maybe that's something that we can work on to have a more layman-friendly version to accompany these documents when they do come before the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3453.742s">[Collins]</a>: That's something we'll certainly continue to talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3456.524s">[Collins]</a>: I know Councilor Leming had a comment, unless there's a direct response from NS or city staff on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3464.062s">[Collins]</a>: No pressure, I just... Councilor Lohmann, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3519.862s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3520.762s">[Collins]</a>: And yeah, I think that's a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3523.919s">[Collins]</a>: Breaking it down, making it simpler is something that we'll continue to try to improve out over the course of this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3529.129s">[Collins]</a>: If you had something to add there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3602.432s">[Collins]</a>: great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3603.092s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3603.692s">[Collins]</a>: I think that that could be a thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3608.213s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3608.573s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilors Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3610.234s">[Collins]</a>: Are there any other questions or comments from counselors on the Salem Street corridor proposal at this time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3619.155s">[Collins]</a>: Myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3619.495s">[Collins]</a>: I was really happy to see, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3621.836s">[Collins]</a>: Some of the themes that were brought up last week and another conversations<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3630.851s">[Collins]</a>: what's the term, the context standards for when we do have those transitions from a mixed use or commercial building to a residential right next to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3638.917s">[Collins]</a>: I think that's a really smart way of making sure that we don't see those really sharp height differences, even if it's only, in a lot of cases, gonna be the difference of a story or two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3651.366s">[Collins]</a>: I think that makes a lot of sense to airspace protection from shade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3658.271s">[Collins]</a>: And I know that there are, I was happy to see also some of the additions to the incentive zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3664.836s">[Collins]</a>: I think the theme here is we want to make sure that we are strongly incentivizing developers to add these things to our communities that we know we want there, while at the same time making sure that we're getting a lot out of it when they are taking advantage of those opportunities for extra heights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3680.748s">[Collins]</a>: And I know that there are more potential things that we're looking to add into incentive zoning that aren't a part of this draft that we're going to continue to consider and maybe add into incentive zoning, either for specific districts or citywide, but that need more discussion and meetings to think about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3695.231s">[Collins]</a>: So thanks for your diligence on that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3698.932s">[Collins]</a>: Seeing no further comments or questions from councilors, we can, any comments or questions from city staff at this time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3707.274s">[Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3712.85s">[Collins]</a>: Go ahead, Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3769.378s">[Collins]</a>: Okay, got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3770.478s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for flagging that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3772.359s">[Collins]</a>: And we'll go to President Beres and then we'll go to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3786.745s">[Collins]</a>: Do you have a follow-up question on that point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3802.05s">[Collins]</a>: Go back to President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3803.031s">[Collins]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3861.688s">[Collins]</a>: And if it is, it's a type of... My apologies, President Bears, I thought that was direct response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3866.71s">[Collins]</a>: Yeah, in my understanding, it's only in the C sub-districts of which there's just that tiny parcel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3871.391s">[Collins]</a>: That's the current gas station remaining.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3879.415s">[Collins]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3933.232s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3934.092s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for reiterating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3934.973s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3936.494s">[Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3936.694s">[Collins]</a>: We'll go down to public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3937.935s">[Collins]</a>: I'm going to alternate between the podium and participants on zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3941.137s">[Collins]</a>: I'm going to set a timer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3942.017s">[Collins]</a>: Every person who'd like to speak, we'll have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3945.82s">[Collins]</a>: And then at the end counselors or at the end of all public participation, counselors and associates, city staff may speak again if they wish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3956.406s">[Collins]</a>: Name and address, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3957.727s">[Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4142.915s">[Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4143.295s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for your comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4144.175s">[Collins]</a>: We'll switch next to Zoom and then back to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4147.676s">[Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4148.176s">[Collins]</a>: I'm going to unmute you, Martha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4150.317s">[Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4152.277s">[Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4281.167s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for your comments, Martha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4282.168s">[Collins]</a>: All right, we'll go back<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4286.328s">[Collins]</a>: To the podium now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4287.716s">[Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4289.901s">[Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4422.605s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for your comments, and as one quick note, we will be visiting West Medford in our citywide review of the zoning ordinance that'll be coming in the spring of 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4433.489s">[Collins]</a>: We're looking at West Medford so residents can look forward to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4437.931s">[Collins]</a>: We will switch back to Zoom now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4439.431s">[Collins]</a>: Jayme, I'm going to ask you to unmute, name and address for the record, please, and you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4474.761s">[Collins]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4477.382s">[Collins]</a>: Yeah Jamie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4478.522s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4478.983s">[Collins]</a>: If you have other questions, feel free to will bucket these and we'll address them all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4515.293s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4515.513s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4515.793s">[Collins]</a>: We have a question about am I and then the calculation used for lot extension onto the side streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4520.815s">[Collins]</a>: Any other questions that you wanted to pose to, uh, last question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4554.949s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4555.87s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Jamie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4556.65s">[Collins]</a>: So we have questions around approximate dollar value for AMI, for the incentive zoning, which is, you know, a citywide thought process or calculation behind the lot extension onto the side streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4571.924s">[Collins]</a>: And then to, again, revisit the thinking behind the Parks and Salem Street intersection designation at MX2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4581.232s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for those questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4582.473s">[Collins]</a>: I'm going to let, I see one more person for public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4585.095s">[Collins]</a>: So I think we're going to round that out and then we'll respond to all questions in a batch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4591.401s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4596.185s">[Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4596.725s">[Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4597.846s">[Collins]</a>: And you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4824.26s">[Collins]</a>: You have 20 seconds left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4824.98s">[Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4852.022s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for your comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4853.923s">[Collins]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4855.683s">[Collins]</a>: I just want to note that this proposal doesn't change any existing parking ratios, ratios per unit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4863.186s">[Collins]</a>: That's true of all the zoning proposals that this council has reviewed so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4867.188s">[Collins]</a>: I also want to note that a lot of the ground floor commercial businesses along Salem Street are nonconformant with the current zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4873.43s">[Collins]</a>: This proposal would allow them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4876.857s">[Collins]</a>: just a point of clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4878.719s">[Collins]</a>: We'll go next to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4881.522s">[Collins]</a>: I saw Ellery's hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4883.204s">[Collins]</a>: First, I'll ask to unmute you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4884.325s">[Collins]</a>: I need your name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4887.309s">[Collins]</a>: And you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5101.628s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5102.329s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Ellery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5104.27s">[Collins]</a>: We'll go back to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5106.011s">[Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5107.472s">[Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5256.543s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5257.444s">[Collins]</a>: We'll go back to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5258.544s">[Collins]</a>: We're going to hear from folks who haven't spoken before, and then we can take an additional minute of comment from folks who have already spoken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5267.909s">[Collins]</a>: Dave, please go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5269.731s">[Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5271.612s">[Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5456.431s">[Collins]</a>: Great, thank you, Dave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5461.913s">[Collins]</a>: Oh, you're at time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5462.594s">[Collins]</a>: I'll give you 30 more seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5492.159s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you very much, Dave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5493.701s">[Collins]</a>: All right, we'll go next to Ren on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5496.765s">[Collins]</a>: Please name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5498.788s">[Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5507.589s">[Collins]</a>: You're off mute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5508.249s">[Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5709.076s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for your comments, Ran.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5712.734s">[Collins]</a>: All right, I don't see any more hands raised on Zoom or in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5716.196s">[Collins]</a>: I do want to make sure we double back to a couple specific questions that were raised earlier in public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5722.76s">[Collins]</a>: I have some numbers up relating to some quick numbers for area median income, but I suspect there's somebody on that side of the rail who can state it more quickly and eloquently than me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5734.867s">[Collins]</a>: Alicia, Danielle, Emily, Paula, would you like to speak to that question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5737.988s">[Collins]</a>: Or I can read off my spreadsheet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5747.484s">[Collins]</a>: And this was just to put some kind of, you know, comprehensible dollar figures to that concept of we talked about 80% AMI, 65% AMI.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5753.014s">[Collins]</a>: If you like, yeah, I don't think we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5919.847s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5920.765s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5922.066s">[Collins]</a>: I think it's helpful to put, you know, kind of understandable numbers that people can think in terms of rent checks or mortgage payments when we talk about these percentages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5929.83s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5930.191s">[Collins]</a>: And then the other two specific questions were around, I know you mentioned in the presentation on that question of where should be MX1, where should be MX2 and the intersection of Salem and Park Street specifically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5942.898s">[Collins]</a>: I recall you saying, you know, paraphrasing, where will we have those more active intersections where there's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5949.122s">[Collins]</a>: more ground floor businesses where it's a busier intersection where there's already more, those are in the proposal characterized as MX2 to reflect that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5957.854s">[Collins]</a>: Can you talk a little bit about Park and Salem specifically?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5965.303s">[Collins]</a>: Oh, gosh, this mic system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6218.356s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, really appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6221.419s">[Collins]</a>: And I think the way it was phrased in the suggestion, the way you phrased it just now, that we're doing this in a geography by geography basis, knowing that all of these geographies are really close together and the changes we make in one neighborhood will affect, they all affect the context.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6237.053s">[Collins]</a>: So I think it can make a lot of sense when we do visit Medford Square in a couple of months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6242.918s">[Collins]</a>: When we're looking at that proposal when we've come to, you know, close to consensus on that proposal to then look to the, you know, areas of the abutting geographies and say, now that we've made these decisions, what, how does that imply, how does that implicate the decisions that we've made in this neighboring area and, you know, kind of be continuing to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6259.028s">[Collins]</a>: think about these questions of where we know we need density, where does it make the most sense where should we do that, where should we prioritize for densification or any of the other goals that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6267.261s">[Collins]</a>: I also want to note because you talked about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6270.225s">[Collins]</a>: If folks are interested in the those kind of like aerial maps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6274.952s">[Collins]</a>: that Emily mentioned that kind of informed some of these decisions about like what to prioritize where on the city zoning page and MedfordMA.org slash zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6283.698s">[Collins]</a>: Scroll down this time beyond phase two meeting documents under resources, click down from citywide maps, click on land use maps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6292.204s">[Collins]</a>: There's a world of details you can get lost in, but I know for folks who are really interested in this stuff, that's your window into the maps that the council and the consultant and city staff looked at several times earlier in this process to inform some of what we're putting where.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6305.533s">[Collins]</a>: Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6538.006s">[Collins]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6538.446s">[Collins]</a>: And I'll just flag the last, the final question that was specifically asked, which goes back to the previous question was, um, the areas where the zoning proposal, it sometimes extends to parcels north and south.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6549.629s">[Collins]</a>: It sometimes extends for, I think that dovetails is what you were saying about looking at the geographies, looking at the overlapping characteristics, but just in case there was anything you wanted to add on that, um, those decisions and specifically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6637.315s">[Collins]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6638.075s">[Collins]</a>: I appreciate the very granular approach that you took to deciding where the corridor starts and ends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6767.842s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6770.844s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6771.385s">[Collins]</a>: Appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6773.707s">[Collins]</a>: Quick follow-up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6774.247s">[Collins]</a>: I know President Bears has been waiting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6997.214s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6997.855s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Pierce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7002.299s">[Collins]</a>: Paula, something to add?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7013.911s">[Collins]</a>: I'm sorry, can you speak up a little bit with the fan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7015.491s">[Collins]</a>: It's very hard to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7131.408s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7132.396s">[Collins]</a>: Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7206.164s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7206.865s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for that, Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7208.185s">[Collins]</a>: Appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7212.435s">[Collins]</a>: and good to know what the window of opportunity is for continuing to tweak individual parcels on the map before it gets, you know, to be a real case to be open to do that again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7220.461s">[Collins]</a>: On that, so should this be reported out of committee tonight, then as we've said a lot of times before, we'll go to the city council and then be referred to the CDB for the recommendations and review and then back to the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7234.211s">[Collins]</a>: Since we are speaking about, you know, this window of opportunity still being open for revisiting individual parcels,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7243.891s">[Collins]</a>: I wonder if it's something that the CDB might be able to specifically weigh in on, this one parcel that kind of sticks out more than all the others in this corridor, the target lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7252.699s">[Collins]</a>: As a result of Councilor and community feedback last meeting, that was changed from commercial to mixed use to to allow for ground floor commercial to allow for residential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7264.315s">[Collins]</a>: This is kind of like the most unique lot on the corridor I think and I'm just wondering if we can while that window is open if we can continue if there's any other sub districts that we could carry in from the MACD so that we can capture all of those goals on this one very unique lot the ground floor commercial the residential and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7282.253s">[Collins]</a>: We have the benefit here of a lot of space, which isn't present elsewhere on the corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7286.115s">[Collins]</a>: I wonder if we can consider more height there beyond just what's allowed for all of the other mixed use two parcels on this corridor, which the dimensions there are totally different than what we're looking for here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7296.98s">[Collins]</a>: If that's something that the CDB and the consultants could weigh in on before the council sees this next, I think I'd be interested to see if there's any other creative<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7311.249s">[Collins]</a>: sub-districts we could look at there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7315.197s">[Collins]</a>: One day we'll get multiple microphones for this situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7319.505s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7369.423s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7370.283s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7372.904s">[Collins]</a>: All right, well, this two hours is simply flown by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7377.426s">[Collins]</a>: Are there any remaining questions or comments from councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7385.251s">[Collins]</a>: Seeing none, the next step in this process would be for this to be referred out of committee to a regular meeting of the city council, where then procedurally it would be referred to the CDB for their review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7398.478s">[Collins]</a>: Do I hear a motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7401.314s">[Collins]</a>: On the motion by Councilor Leming to report out of committee, seconded by Councilor Callahan.<br><br>
