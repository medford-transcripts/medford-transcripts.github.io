    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4211.496s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Penny, for being here tonight and for presenting, you know, some of the process and progress that's gone into the work that this grant has enabled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4219.101s">[Collins]</a>: I think, you know, over the past year, this grant, I mean, I know it's gone on for more than the past year, but, you know, what's come out of this has been one of the things that I, you know, feel most proud of in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4229.067s">[Collins]</a>: It's really great to be able to see some first steps towards language equity, doing a better job of reaching out to the people who, you know, historically do not show up to City Hall,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4238.154s">[Collins]</a>: are not reached out to, don't speak the language, you know, in whatever way, I think this is really important work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4242.997s">[Collins]</a>: And it's great to get sort of these concrete facts about what specifically has been done, what the grant has enabled the city to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4250.24s">[Collins]</a>: I think that it's important for us to get a picture of what doing that work of bringing more of the community into community spaces, how that breaks down into roles and positions and programs, kind of gives those numbers some context.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4265.466s">[Collins]</a>: You know, as a, as a counselor, and I know that you in your office, you, you, you get this, you know, 10 times more than, than we do, but, you know, we hear from people looking for housing, we hear from people who are looking for pro bono legal representation, you know, the eviction crisis in Medford square several months ago, eviction help, you know, tenant organizing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4283.34s">[Collins]</a>: I'm been very involved with the mutual aid network for several years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4286.122s">[Collins]</a>: You know, I, what strikes me every time these conversations come up is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4290.461s">[Collins]</a>: It seems like over and over again, we hit against the fact that even our provider network are very close to hitting their bandwidth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4298.743s">[Collins]</a>: And I know that it's in my mind so strongly all the time that our regional network of providers is inundated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4308.625s">[Collins]</a>: There's so much need, you said for housing, food insecurity, there's so much need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4312.366s">[Collins]</a>: And I know that that's one of the many things that we need a regional approach for, we need more state assistance for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4318.908s">[Collins]</a>: Where this comes in as I think,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4320.558s">[Collins]</a>: Given that it's so important for us to streamline on the local level as much as possible to make sure that everybody in our community who needs those resources can access them in an easy way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4329.322s">[Collins]</a>: I think this program is doing that and that everybody in the community can have equitable access to the resources that are available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4335.745s">[Collins]</a>: And I really hope that that work can continue in parallel with, you know, regionally and with our other providers working to make sure that we have more places to direct people to, you know, I'm sure it's heartbreaking for your staff every time you have to say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4349.366s">[Collins]</a>: I can get you on that wait list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4350.426s">[Collins]</a>: I can get you on that list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4351.507s">[Collins]</a>: I can't wait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4352.007s">[Collins]</a>: I can't get you on that wait list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4353.107s">[Collins]</a>: And I'm sure that's, I'm sure that's really hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4355.348s">[Collins]</a>: So I just thank you for, thank you for this work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4357.349s">[Collins]</a>: I'm really excited to see how it continues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4358.949s">[Collins]</a>: And like vice president Behr said, so any way this council can support you and continue that work, you know, we're partners with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5659.556s">[Collins]</a>: I just wanted to thank you for coming before us for having these numbers prepared and for your candor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5664.038s">[Collins]</a>: I think we all know that when you took the job here, you didn't sign up for a cakewalk, but we all know how much is on your plates with catching up from our financial backlog, reconciling everything, and we don't want<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5679.025s">[Collins]</a>: you know, your, your role in, in, in getting us up to speed to be any more, you know, painful than it has to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5685.269s">[Collins]</a>: So I'm hoping that, you know, I'm looking forward to the presentation in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5688.211s">[Collins]</a>: I really appreciate, you know, your help in dialing down how to get us what we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5692.595s">[Collins]</a>: And I hope that, you know, at that presentation and the committee of the whole, if we refer it there, we can also at that point kind of assess what do we need going forward to make sure that this back and forth between the council and your offices, you know, having communication wise, what it needs,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5706.817s">[Collins]</a>: just to make sure that that's as streamlined as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5708.699s">[Collins]</a>: So again, thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5710.48s">[Collins]</a>: We do really appreciate your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7294.493s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morrell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7296.434s">[Collins]</a>: You know, mostly right now, I want to, I know there are community members in the room, I want to hear<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7301.169s">[Collins]</a>: from community members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7303.551s">[Collins]</a>: But I just wanted to say at the outset, you know, yesterday's incident was heartbreaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7308.394s">[Collins]</a>: It's traumatizing during an already extremely raw and difficult time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7316.219s">[Collins]</a>: These events affect the whole community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7318.801s">[Collins]</a>: As leaders, I think it's our responsibility to hear from people who are the most affected, the students, the families, teachers, and staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7324.705s">[Collins]</a>: I think we can all agree, nothing is more important than our public schools being safe and stable and supportive<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7331.007s">[Collins]</a>: everybody who has to be inside of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7332.648s">[Collins]</a>: I think that's a really shared goal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7335.529s">[Collins]</a>: And I think this heartbreak is shared that our schools are not safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7340.151s">[Collins]</a>: They're not secure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7341.072s">[Collins]</a>: They don't feel supportive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7343.053s">[Collins]</a>: And, you know, in this conversation, you know, I want to hear from the people most affected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7347.355s">[Collins]</a>: That's the folks who go to the schools every day and the people who love them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7351.857s">[Collins]</a>: As we mentioned, you know, many counselors, myself included, have papers later on the agenda for ways that this council can act within its power to try and be part of the solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7361.372s">[Collins]</a>: We'll get into more of that later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7364.693s">[Collins]</a>: It's deeply troubling that we have to be having this conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7369.296s">[Collins]</a>: It's hard to put into words how to express sympathy for something so painful that's happened to kids just going to school and their families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7379.161s">[Collins]</a>: It's a sorry thing, the events that precipitated this discussion, but we have to have it and we're gonna have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7386.865s">[Collins]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli and others were calling for urgent action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7390.199s">[Collins]</a>: We're calling for the council to act within its purview to try and be part of the solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7393.841s">[Collins]</a>: And I completely agree, completely agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7398.283s">[Collins]</a>: You know, we have to use our powers as city councilors to try and be part of the solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7402.265s">[Collins]</a>: We aren't the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7404.286s">[Collins]</a>: We can't be the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7405.887s">[Collins]</a>: We can't make the type of the decisions that the school community is empowered to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7410.029s">[Collins]</a>: We can use the powers that we have as the city council to try to direct resources where they need to go to try to be a part of the community-wide conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7417.628s">[Collins]</a>: to emphasize the voices of the folks that are most affected by this, to listen to the people who know best where those resources need to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7424.231s">[Collins]</a>: And I'm glad that we get to be a part of that conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7426.992s">[Collins]</a>: I hope that going forward, this can be more collaborative, that we can all do our specific roles, but in concert with each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7435.715s">[Collins]</a>: And lastly, since Councilor Scarpelli's resolution calls for public input, if anybody's here to give input, I just want to acknowledge that not everybody does feel comfortable speaking in public, especially on live TV.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7445.68s">[Collins]</a>: It's not for the faint of heart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7447.356s">[Collins]</a>: And also not every comment, especially when kids and school security is involved, is best said in a public setting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7454.543s">[Collins]</a>: I just wanna restate for the record, whether we're in session or not, I'm available to any resident, to any constituent to field ideas, to hear your questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7465.213s">[Collins]</a>: If you just need a listening ear, if you don't feel comfortable speaking tonight, you can always reach out to me, we're available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7473.218s">[Collins]</a>: So I just wanted to say that at the outset of any community input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7477.341s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9175.618s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morrell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9176.518s">[Collins]</a>: And I'm speaking off the cuff here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9178.819s">[Collins]</a>: So I just want to say, you know, I think that what the community deserves today in the aftermath of yesterday's events, in the aftermath of other traumatic, tragic events, what the community deserves is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9194.111s">[Collins]</a>: a communicative, collaborative city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9199.876s">[Collins]</a>: They deserve clear communication, resolve to work together productively from all their elected leaders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9207.843s">[Collins]</a>: We owe our community better than infighting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9210.386s">[Collins]</a>: You know, we've disagreed on many things many times before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9214.389s">[Collins]</a>: Behind this rail, it'll happen again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9217.292s">[Collins]</a>: That's what we're here to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9219.332s">[Collins]</a>: We're here to represent different viewpoints for perspective on issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9222.973s">[Collins]</a>: We're here to represent different viewpoints for how to, how to craft strategy and how to respond to problems in our community and how to plan for the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9231.094s">[Collins]</a>: But I think that we owe today, especially today and all days, we owe the community a productive use of our time, discussing available strategies for what we can do within our powers to try to deal with the problems before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9246.478s">[Collins]</a>: I, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9248.973s">[Collins]</a>: What, what looks like a buzzword to one counselor might be somebody else's best good faith, earnest approach at doing something that is within our power, within our purview to try to address specifically a problem that exists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9265.717s">[Collins]</a>: It's put forth in good faith.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9267.018s">[Collins]</a>: And I think that tracks both ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9268.478s">[Collins]</a>: I don't think it's productive for us to launch into<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9274.321s">[Collins]</a>: veiled personal attacks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9275.682s">[Collins]</a>: You know, I don't want, I don't want that to be what tonight is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9279.184s">[Collins]</a>: I think that we have to come together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9280.846s">[Collins]</a>: We have to discuss the strategies that we've put forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9283.367s">[Collins]</a>: We might not agree on all of them, but what our community is calling out for is a good faith, earnest discussion of strategies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9290.372s">[Collins]</a>: It does our community no good to spill a lot of ink and spill a lot of airtime, fighting about things that we cannot control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9300.88s">[Collins]</a>: The community deserves better than a performance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9303.223s">[Collins]</a>: we need to discuss strategies that we have the capacity to enforce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9307.105s">[Collins]</a>: And sometimes we will disagree about what those best strategies are, but that's what our time should be for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9311.666s">[Collins]</a>: So I have a rationale for why I brought the strategies that I think are most important to talk about here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9317.669s">[Collins]</a>: I know those feelings aren't universally shared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9319.85s">[Collins]</a>: I'll save that for when those papers are brought up, but I really hope that we can maintain<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9325.708s">[Collins]</a>: clear communication and sticking to the issues at hand and striving for concrete strategies for as much of this evening as possible, because that's what the community needs from us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9333.399s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12246.495s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12247.856s">[Collins]</a>: Um, I it's, it's hard to add anything after a story like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12251.239s">[Collins]</a>: I don't have anything to add.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12252.12s">[Collins]</a>: I just wanted to thank you for, for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12254.021s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for sharing your story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12256.402s">[Collins]</a>: I'm not a parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12257.182s">[Collins]</a>: I can't fathom what it's like to be a parent and go through something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12260.183s">[Collins]</a>: Something that unfortunately a lot of families in our public school systems have to go through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12264.144s">[Collins]</a>: It's heartbreaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12264.885s">[Collins]</a>: I just want to say, you know, our hearts go out to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12266.725s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15180.457s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you very much, President Morrell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15182.439s">[Collins]</a>: Tonight is the third night of the holiday Hanukkah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15185.321s">[Collins]</a>: I hope my colleagues will join me in wishing a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15187.734s">[Collins]</a>: Chag Sameach or happy holiday to all who celebrate this holiday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15191.936s">[Collins]</a>: Celebrates the legend of an oil candle that burned in probably for eight whole nights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15196.597s">[Collins]</a>: And I think tonight we can celebrate the miracle of a hypothetical candle that burned for a probably five hour city council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15202.499s">[Collins]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15431.086s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Merrill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15432.407s">[Collins]</a>: Just to keep it very brief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15433.528s">[Collins]</a>: This is a project that I've already discussed with the director of PBS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15437.11s">[Collins]</a>: This came about because of my involvement in the Solid Waste Task Force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15440.072s">[Collins]</a>: They thought that an ordinance to this effect would help further the overall goals of the task force and further streamline<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15447.231s">[Collins]</a>: standards and operations for all waste haulers in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15450.292s">[Collins]</a>: They've already indicated that draft language is available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15453.853s">[Collins]</a>: So I'd move approval for referring this into subcommittee for further study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1172.22s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Chair Seng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1176.072s">[Collins]</a>: Yeah, I think that this is another one of this council's big projects that it would behoove us and the community to try to set an ambitious timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1186.038s">[Collins]</a>: There is so much to discuss here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1188.819s">[Collins]</a>: And I know that there's a ton of energy around reviewing the charter in the community right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1193.922s">[Collins]</a>: So I think that we should try to do what we can on the city council side to have the option stay open, to be putting changes to voters sooner instead of missing that window that only comes around once every several years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1207.09s">[Collins]</a>: So I think that we should approach that, yeah, ambitiously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1209.412s">[Collins]</a>: And as for kind of how to get started on that, I do think that it'd be worthwhile for us to have a meeting to kind of internally review and discuss the report before we start meeting with other stakeholders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1221.0s">[Collins]</a>: And I mean, I think there's a lot of reasons to do that, just because it's a lot to digest, there's a lot to discuss, it's all very consequential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1226.944s">[Collins]</a>: But also, I know that in this process, we're inevitably going to try and reconcile and find consensus<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1233.666s">[Collins]</a>: between perspectives that might be very different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1235.647s">[Collins]</a>: And I'd prefer for us to kind of have some chances to get ideas from different sources out on the table before we then start having those discussions between different types of stakeholders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1245.23s">[Collins]</a>: Because I think this is going to be a process where there are a lot of different ideas and different preferences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1250.692s">[Collins]</a>: And I think it would serve us well if we approach it from a standpoint of, I'm not having a different idea from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1258.826s">[Collins]</a>: you, whoever that is, in reaction to your idea or in opposition to that idea, but rather there are different approaches to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1264.49s">[Collins]</a>: Let's get them all out on the table, and then let's consider all of our approaches and just try to choose the best path forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=955.624s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Barras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=956.325s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being with us here tonight and for all the legwork that you've been doing to get the FY 25 estimated valuations online months earlier than you otherwise would.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=965.791s">[Collins]</a>: Really appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=966.671s">[Collins]</a>: And I appreciate that it helps folks get a clearer picture of what precisely their bills might look like in the future based on various<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=977.478s">[Collins]</a>: how the votes go in various directions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=979.52s">[Collins]</a>: So just to make sure that I understand the information that's available, and it would be, is it on the Assessor's Department page or the Finance Department page on the city website?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1010.909s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1011.19s">[Collins]</a>: So up until today, people can call your office or look on the assessor's department website webpage and find the webpage is going to be dependent on like, I'm going to try to get it up this week, but like, it's just however fast we can do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1025.423s">[Collins]</a>: But<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1026.26s">[Collins]</a>: We have the FY 24 based calculations and now you're expediting getting the FY 25 based valuations so that people can have even more clarity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1036.485s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1036.765s">[Collins]</a>: Well, thank you so much for updating that ahead of schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1038.686s">[Collins]</a>: Appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1823.786s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Behrs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1824.529s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1828.319s">[Collins]</a>: I want to add a disclaimer that I obviously sitting behind this rail on this date, I'm not a school committee member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1834.8s">[Collins]</a>: I don't have that level of granular knowledge of the school department and the school department makes its own budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1840.641s">[Collins]</a>: The city council does not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1842.102s">[Collins]</a>: That being said, I have discussed this matter extensively with people in the community, with people involved in the schools, with school committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1852.524s">[Collins]</a>: I understand that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1854.224s">[Collins]</a>: you know, what we stand to lose if these questions do not pass includes, you know, some of the stuff that people involved in the schools may remember from when we had to cut the school's budget during the pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1867.679s">[Collins]</a>: And that includes eliminating positions, including teachers, nurses, behavioral specialists, literary coaches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1875.568s">[Collins]</a>: We lose the opportunity to add programming within the schools that supplement the curriculum that is state mandated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1883.713s">[Collins]</a>: So, some programming that is really beloved by students and their families, such as arts and musical curricula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1892.297s">[Collins]</a>: We lose the opportunity to augment the student experience with those types of classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1897.44s">[Collins]</a>: We lose the opportunity to augment the student experience with more people in supportive roles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1905.625s">[Collins]</a>: such as therapists, nurses, people outside of the classroom who are nevertheless there to make sure that students can thrive in our schools and achieve the best learning that they can?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1919.275s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1921.256s">[Collins]</a>: These two questions combined also limit our ability to offer competitive and living wages to the many, many people who work in our schools and offer<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1931.823s">[Collins]</a>: students the experience that they really deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1935.005s">[Collins]</a>: We know that we need to be offering living wages to our teachers and paras and all school staff because it's the right thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1940.446s">[Collins]</a>: We also know that we need to be able to do that in order to keep these people in our school system so that our students are served in the way that they deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1949.118s">[Collins]</a>: This will also have impacts on building maintenance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3181.923s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Behrs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3183.224s">[Collins]</a>: I appreciate the discussion from my fellow councilors on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3186.525s">[Collins]</a>: I won't go into the topic of new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3189.146s">[Collins]</a>: My fellow councilors have covered that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3190.947s">[Collins]</a>: We are very optimistic about how the council's current work on zoning and permitting, which we've been keeping up for two terms, will continue to accelerate new growth and augment the city's operating budget to the greatest extent possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3204.334s">[Collins]</a>: I do just want to note that on the issue of free cash, just to, I think,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3208.359s">[Collins]</a>: Different ways of framing the issue are helpful for me, maybe for other people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3215.22s">[Collins]</a>: It's no secret that we accrued free cash over several years, and that was not dispersed into savings accounts where it could be used and spent on capital expenditures because our city, unlike almost every other city and town in Massachusetts, before this year did not have any stabilization accounts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3233.504s">[Collins]</a>: Now we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3234.204s">[Collins]</a>: That means that that money can go to the purposes that I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3237.225s">[Collins]</a>: City staff and many residents really wanted it to be going to expected it to be going to all along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3242.548s">[Collins]</a>: Things like capital expenses and also repairing our infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3246.49s">[Collins]</a>: Putting aside some of that money that's already been allocated to things that people can see out on the street, helping our DPW and other departments improve life and do basic maintenance in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3255.474s">[Collins]</a>: Even if you say, okay, let's forget some of those capital expenditures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3258.476s">[Collins]</a>: Let's pretend that we still have $25 million in free cash, just using an easy number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3263.29s">[Collins]</a>: That's one-eighth of the city's annual operating budget, which means, you know, if it's one-eighth, you can understand how quickly we would run through that if we were using that as things to plug the hole in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3273.975s">[Collins]</a>: And I do want to emphasize that doesn't include any capital expenses whatsoever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3279.618s">[Collins]</a>: Going back to the resident's question on why now, I think it comes down to we know that free cash is not sustainable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3287.581s">[Collins]</a>: We know that we're already full steam on new growth, but we need more and better funding and services for our residents now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3294.686s">[Collins]</a>: And I think the question is, do we want to punish residents and students for past shortcomings by failing to invest now, or do we want to take this opportunity to start making Medford better for all residents and students in the public schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3427.807s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3429.108s">[Collins]</a>: The financial task force was a group explicitly made up of elected to consider the question of what we would put before our elected bodies to deal with solutions around this problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3441.258s">[Collins]</a>: However, I feel really comfortable in saying that all of the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3445.622s">[Collins]</a>: above types of people, city staff, members of the community, were consulted in various ways, formally and informally, throughout this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3454.393s">[Collins]</a>: Some that people talked to, some that members of the financial task force talked to while we were considering these matters that were discussed in our meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3462.183s">[Collins]</a>: Some of that were explicitly consulted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3464.705s">[Collins]</a>: And others that have just been part of this greater conversation around what should we do with about what should we do about chronic underfunding in Medford over the course of months and months and years and years of challenges that have led up to this year in which we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3479.477s">[Collins]</a>: Working together to try to solve these issues once and for all, instead of having budget season after budget season, where the school budget is essentially held hostage by our inability to raise enough money to add to provide the services that residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3494.785s">[Collins]</a>: students and teachers expect and deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3497.567s">[Collins]</a>: And I also just want to underline, again, that these ballot questions, every single resident, every single voter in Medford, whether you're a parent, a teacher, a union member, somebody who works for the city, who also lives in the city, you get to use your voice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3511.436s">[Collins]</a>: You get to cast your vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3512.557s">[Collins]</a>: You can vote yes on all three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3513.738s">[Collins]</a>: You can vote no on all three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3515.019s">[Collins]</a>: You can choose which ones you feel comfortable voting yes and voting no on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3518.141s">[Collins]</a>: You are a part of this conversation because every single person who votes gets a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3523.324s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4089.914s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4091.856s">[Collins]</a>: Again, speaking as a member of the financial task force, I want to try to put this a different way because maybe I wasn't, I want to try putting this differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4101.403s">[Collins]</a>: The financial task force, this group of electeds, tasked with- And the chief of staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4110.911s">[Collins]</a>: As the mayor's staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4114.189s">[Collins]</a>: If I had a staff person, I probably want them with me taking notes as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4120.114s">[Collins]</a>: Our assignment was to create a proposal for a political solution to a community-wide problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4126.18s">[Collins]</a>: And that is why this task force was made up of electeds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4129.242s">[Collins]</a>: I think folks who are asking the question, rightfully so, of why did you come up with what you came up with should<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4139.801s">[Collins]</a>: look to the hours and hours of tape that we have the public meetings that we've had in this chambers between the city council and the school committee where we discussed that question in terms of why seven and a half million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4154.619s">[Collins]</a>: Gosh, there's a lot of school committee meetings enumerating exactly what we cut in various different budget scenarios to back up why we think that this is the number that is at the nexus of what we know that we need and what we think that we can reasonably ask of the residents to strike that sweet spot between<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4171.044s">[Collins]</a>: trying to maintain an equitable and deserved school experience for Medford Public School students with something that the community can be comfortable with and can say yes to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4182.393s">[Collins]</a>: It is our job as people who run for offices, instead of going to planning school and trying to get a job in City Hall, to try to come up with, for lack of a better word, political solutions to real life community-wide problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4195.804s">[Collins]</a>: That is what the task force sought to do, and now everybody gets the chance to vote on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5033.681s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5035.001s">[Collins]</a>: Not to put too fine a point on it, but I think we've all acknowledged behind the rail<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5040.879s">[Collins]</a>: that we have problems this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5042.6s">[Collins]</a>: And let's say hypothetically that our free cash was not already allocated to capital funds that our department heads have been advocating for in many cases for years and years and years and being pushed off because we didn't have the money to allocate towards those capital expenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5057.472s">[Collins]</a>: And now we're finally able to start chipping away at that very, very long list of projects on our capital improvement plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5064.338s">[Collins]</a>: Let's just put aside that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5067.637s">[Collins]</a>: and say, hypothetically, what if we still had unallocated free cash that we could use on an operating budget, which we don't because it's allocated to capital projects?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5077.041s">[Collins]</a>: I think that there's a shared acknowledgment behind this rail that that does put us back at square one, and we have to revisit this conversation again in May for fiscal 26 with no better solutions than we do now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5089.566s">[Collins]</a>: So I've asked myself,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5091.852s">[Collins]</a>: What would I cut if we then approaching fiscal 26 with no better off because new growth takes five to 10 years to really flourish into that robustly improved commercial tax base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5105.555s">[Collins]</a>: And we haven't taken advantage of accelerating our tax levy so that we can try to get in fighting distance of where inflation has put us as a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5118.092s">[Collins]</a>: And now we don't have the cash reserves that again are hypothetical at this point because we already know that we need them for capital expenses and we have to balance the budget for fiscal 26.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5127.715s">[Collins]</a>: What would I cut?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5130.016s">[Collins]</a>: There's nothing to cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5131.176s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5310.994s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5311.274s">[Collins]</a>: I'm sure that my fellow councilors will add to this list, but just to reference some of the data points that have been coming up multiple times in this meeting in particular, I'd guide you to the pavement management plan that was put out by the DPW some years ago, and that's a few years out of date now, but it details the- It was actually updated last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5328.939s">[Collins]</a>: Oh, nevermind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5329.819s">[Collins]</a>: Updated last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5331.219s">[Collins]</a>: That details the $200 million in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5337.401s">[Collins]</a>: backlog of road repairs that are needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5340.123s">[Collins]</a>: For more detail on the needs in the schools, I would direct you to really any of the budget cycles, the recent budget cycles, school committee meetings, FY23 or FY24, which I think go into the level of detail that folks are really curious about when it comes to what is at stake, what actually does go on the chopping block each year, and that is brought back depending on ESSER funding, when that was available, or other one-time funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5362.429s">[Collins]</a>: And I think that the capital improvement plan is also a really interesting augment to those operating costs that show how much money really needs to be funded to on the infrastructural and maintenance side that we are really waiting to have the funding for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7486.193s">[Collins]</a>: Mine is related to a different part of the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7592.861s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, and just quickly to follow up on that, I'll note that, again, to echo what President Behr said, it's not within the purview of this council to have any input on the design of the fire headquarters, but I will note for folks who might be interested, on the city website under the fire department webpage, there are links to six of the concept plans that were published this year, which I think is interesting for folks, for residents who want a little bit more detail, because it actually enumerates what's different in each design from the one preceding it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7910.986s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7912.047s">[Collins]</a>: Um, again, as a city council member, not involved in the school's department budgeting process, but I would just say, considering these questions,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7923.373s">[Collins]</a>: thinking about the motives behind them in terms of the motives for community, the motives politically for putting these forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7931.682s">[Collins]</a>: It's hard for me to imagine, even putting on my cynical hat, what our gain could possibly be in putting forward<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7940.677s">[Collins]</a>: a question that asks residents to pay more in taxes to then spend it on spurious things in the schools department when we know, because we hear from residents all the time, all year long in school department meetings, in school committee meetings and in city council meetings, the adverse effects on students and teachers and staff because of underfunding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7962.072s">[Collins]</a>: And the ways that we want to see the school experience be better for students that we can't yet afford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7968.415s">[Collins]</a>: It's it's hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7969.735s">[Collins]</a>: We have no motivation to raise this money and then spend it on things that are not the things that the community has already been in some cases really begging city leadership to spend it on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7984.265s">[Collins]</a>: I'm not involved in the weeds of the school's department budgeting process the way that the school committee is in the way that the school's department is, but there is, it's just impossible for me to imagine a scenario where this money will be spent on 30 seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8001.633s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8004.821s">[Collins]</a>: The goal of doing this very difficult thing, which indeed is causing a lot of difficult conversations in the community, is to improve life for Medford public school students, life and conditions for Medford residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8018.344s">[Collins]</a>: It would be... 10 seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8021.585s">[Collins]</a>: It would be bizarre for us to spend it away on various things that weren't directly related to improving quality of life for residents and students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8681.817s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8684.56s">[Collins]</a>: Obviously, there's been a lot said in this Q&A forum, and I just think that with everything else that we've been hearing, I also want to put on the record that we talked about the costs if the overrides should pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8697.174s">[Collins]</a>: The assessor gave a great presentation earlier about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8700.356s">[Collins]</a>: how costs will go up regardless, how costs will go up if seven passes, how costs will go up if both pass, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8708.463s">[Collins]</a>: And that's significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8709.824s">[Collins]</a>: I think that is significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8710.704s">[Collins]</a>: I think that people should take it seriously and decide how they feel about it and if they think that they can afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8715.108s">[Collins]</a>: And what if any exemptions apply to them and how those will work with them and call the assessor if they have questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8720.032s">[Collins]</a>: I also think that what also deserves a serious and honest discussion is how households and individuals end up paying out of pocket if we continue to not fund our public sector, if we continue to let our roads and sidewalks get worse and worse and worse, which is something to be taken seriously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8740.018s">[Collins]</a>: It is a safety issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8741.519s">[Collins]</a>: It is an accessibility issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8743.179s">[Collins]</a>: If we continue to let our schools get worse and keep missing every opportunity to make them get better,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8753.203s">[Collins]</a>: I think it is frankly condescending to build this discussion as nothing more than trying to scare people into voting a certain way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8764.205s">[Collins]</a>: For the people who think, wow, what if the schools are no longer an environment where my student can learn or thrive?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8771.246s">[Collins]</a>: I cannot pay for a tutor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8773.187s">[Collins]</a>: I cannot pay for five-day school tuition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8775.467s">[Collins]</a>: I am concerned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8778.388s">[Collins]</a>: We should not be belittling that emotion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8780.575s">[Collins]</a>: We should not be belittling people who are having to pay out of pocket every year for car repairs, because we can't take care of the most basic thing in our city in a way that makes it not quite so obvious when you drive from Winchester into Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8797.645s">[Collins]</a>: The format of this discussion was supposed to be a Q&A session where residents can ask questions and counselors could give answers to the best of their ability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8805.53s">[Collins]</a>: I am pretty disappointed that it's turned into an event where certain counselors are telling residents not how they should vote, but how they should feel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9307.898s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9308.258s">[Collins]</a>: I'll be quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9309.139s">[Collins]</a>: Just a quick point of information because I know it's been said a few times tonight that the $500,000 would quote, fix the roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9316.463s">[Collins]</a>: I think that as the published pavement management plan on the city website establishes that we have $200 million in a backlog of road repairs in the city, I think we're all very aware<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9327.529s">[Collins]</a>: that half a million dollars is not going to fix the roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9330.79s">[Collins]</a>: As it says in the text of the question, what this would do is enable the DPW to establish, as it reads, additional staff for road and sidewalk infrastructure repair, which relates to the in-house hot top crew that Councilor Scarpelli has been advocating for for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9344.216s">[Collins]</a>: So Councilor, I'm sad to hear that you've reversed your position on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9902.296s">[Collins]</a>: No, I mean, if you have more detail to add on the Cambridge Fire Station example, I just think that we covered this question earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10513.008s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10513.408s">[Collins]</a>: Just in brief, obviously we know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10517.418s">[Collins]</a>: That's really tough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10518.199s">[Collins]</a>: And we know that the student experience coming out of the pandemic when so much critical in classroom learning time was missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10523.184s">[Collins]</a>: That's really tough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10523.985s">[Collins]</a>: It's really tough for a lot of students feel for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10528.089s">[Collins]</a>: I will just say that I know the topic of literacy coaches in classroom specifically came up a lot in school committee budget meetings and city council budget meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10539.08s">[Collins]</a>: And as we were discussing, putting together these numbers for Proposition 7 and Proposition 8 specifically, because we know that that is such a need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10547.184s">[Collins]</a>: One of my big concerns if the overrides don't pass is that we would not be able to bring online the literacy coaches that we know that students like your son really need more of in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10558.31s">[Collins]</a>: And if they do pass, we would be empowered to be able to have more of those coaches in the schools helping students make up for the time that they lost during the pandemic and just due to other factors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11568.814s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11569.234s">[Collins]</a>: Appreciate the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11573.024s">[Collins]</a>: I am normally actually and every single penny every single nickel counts type of person in my household budget, certainly, you know, we take every penny very seriously and municipal budgeting because this is our collective wealth to do with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11588.789s">[Collins]</a>: in all of the discussions in public meetings, city council meetings, school committee meetings, task force meetings around what is the number that we should put forward that we're asking people to vote for to invest in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11599.931s">[Collins]</a>: I spent a lot of those meetings advocating for a much, much, much higher number than just 7.5 to be spread around the DPW and the schools and other expenses, but mostly the schools, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11610.293s">[Collins]</a>: And I think when we're having those discussions that are essentially landing at this is the minimum amount that we can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11616.909s">[Collins]</a>: try to invest in our schools to have to at least hold the line and prime the pump for them then getting better in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11624.331s">[Collins]</a>: Maybe not even get better this year, but at least keep them from backsliding so we can hope to have them improve in future fiscal years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11632.454s">[Collins]</a>: When $7 million is the scope of the investment, that is essentially the minimum for not backsliding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11639.576s">[Collins]</a>: You put that against a 2% COLA for certain electeds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11644.372s">[Collins]</a>: and bringing up other electeds to not even parity with that position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11649.773s">[Collins]</a>: I think if we're having an honest discussion, we can all look at that and say apples and oranges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12062.916s">[Collins]</a>: Part of our discussion has been around the salaries that this year are currently on one-time funds that will expire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12070.119s">[Collins]</a>: And putting forward the override questions as an on-ramp for those positions is, again, once that one-time funding that they're currently being funded by has been depleted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12080.542s">[Collins]</a>: But in your clarification, I think that my point might have been usurped by something else that you were saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12091.038s">[Collins]</a>: Only if you have one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12093.359s">[Collins]</a>: No, I'm good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12324.554s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12325.374s">[Collins]</a>: Really fair question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12326.194s">[Collins]</a>: I'm glad that you asked it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12327.775s">[Collins]</a>: In terms of what's directly within our purview as city councilors, I know for as long as I've been on the council, I'm in my second term now, we have been, I think, extremely focused on parts of our jurisdiction that relate directly to expanding commercial tax base, which is the ways that we can increase city revenue without going to residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12348.234s">[Collins]</a>: We've been talking a lot about our zoning project, especially recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12351.074s">[Collins]</a>: It didn't begin recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12352.655s">[Collins]</a>: We've been fighting for, I think, three terms, since longer than I've been on the council, to be able to work with a zoning consultant to do really smart, tailored zoning that will allow us to grow the parts of the city that people have been wanting to see growth in for years, so that we'll see what we wanna see there, and also be adding to our commercial tax base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12370.078s">[Collins]</a>: And we've been starting to do that, and we're already starting to see the seeds of results on Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12375.119s">[Collins]</a>: Of course, that revenue isn't gonna come online<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12378.467s">[Collins]</a>: until like a longer timescale than we really, that's not, we don't see the rewards from that in one year, we see that in five, 10, 20 years, but that is directly within our jurisdiction, and we've been extremely focused on this council, on laying the groundwork for commercial tax-based growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12393.988s">[Collins]</a>: City Hall departments, I think, are really, one of the things that they're remarkable for is in grant-seeking, especially our Planning Development Sustainability Office, and I do know that every department in this city works really hard to get grant funding for some of its essential projects or other projects that we don't have to take those monies out of the operating budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12413.178s">[Collins]</a>: The City Council, whenever we can, we support those grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12417.08s">[Collins]</a>: We approve when that's within our jurisdiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12419.041s">[Collins]</a>: We try to support<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12421.582s">[Collins]</a>: resources, funding for projects coming from not from residents, wallets, essentially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12428.285s">[Collins]</a>: In addition, then there's the advocacy side and people bringing up, what is the state doing about this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12433.267s">[Collins]</a>: What is the state paying and how are other players paying in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12436.149s">[Collins]</a>: We constantly advocate for an increase in trying to remember what this UGGA actually stands for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12443.012s">[Collins]</a>: I think it's unrestricted, like general aggregation, constantly advocating for the state to pay into cities like Medford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12450.755s">[Collins]</a>: more so that we can do more for our residents the way that the state would like us to do, constantly advocating for changes in the payment in lieu of tax agreement laws so that we can turn to institutions like Tufts and say, hey, you don't pay a lot of property tax, all of our other residents do, let's make this more fair, trying to pull what levers we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13215.882s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13216.122s">[Collins]</a>: I just want to thank you for being here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13217.862s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for your advocacy on this issue, and thank you for advocating for firefighters in general in Medford all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13226.184s">[Collins]</a>: I understand that this is complicated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13227.404s">[Collins]</a>: I also know that as a city council, we approach this at different levels of distance from just the dollars and cents of the proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13234.944s">[Collins]</a>: And from the specifics of the fire headquarters proposal that is being worked out between the fire department, maybe fire department leadership is more accurate to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13246.252s">[Collins]</a>: And principally the mayor's office, we're not involved in that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13249.794s">[Collins]</a>: I can say for myself as one counselor that after hearing for so many months and years, this is an improved headquarters is urgently needed, urgently deserved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13257.541s">[Collins]</a>: the fire department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13259.163s">[Collins]</a>: Um, that that is trying to bring that about as expeditiously as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13263.428s">[Collins]</a>: It's my priority as a city counselor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13265.83s">[Collins]</a>: Um, I know from, you know, just following the publications of the, you know, kind of continually updated concept drafts that's put out by the mayor's office that, um, you know, at least from what I from what I'm able to see, it seems like feedback is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13278.945s">[Collins]</a>: continuing to be incorporated and updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13280.846s">[Collins]</a>: Again, I'm just sharing what's visible on my side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13283.147s">[Collins]</a>: I know that there's another perspective that you represent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13287.57s">[Collins]</a>: It is my sincere hope from hearing that this is so urgently needed for so long that we are able to see a truly collaborative process that results in the fire headquarters that the fire department needs, deserves, expects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13304.719s">[Collins]</a>: that we can move on with this urgency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13307.74s">[Collins]</a>: And, you know, I think that that's just what the community needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13310.501s">[Collins]</a>: Certainly that's what the fire department needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13311.962s">[Collins]</a>: And I hope that we can do that on a timeframe that we can move on it this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13316.924s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13801.986s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13802.326s">[Collins]</a>: Appreciate the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13803.146s">[Collins]</a>: Obviously, I'm going to give a highly subjective answer because this isn't really a policy question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13807.947s">[Collins]</a>: You know, obviously, I'm really saddened to see<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13812.759s">[Collins]</a>: Well, let me start here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13814.359s">[Collins]</a>: I really understand why people are so concerned about these questions from both sides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13820.461s">[Collins]</a>: I see people saying, wow, my bills are going to go up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13822.701s">[Collins]</a>: That's really serious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13824.181s">[Collins]</a>: And I need to understand why that's being proposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13826.482s">[Collins]</a>: I can also see people saying, wow, these things that these questions would pay for are really dire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13832.123s">[Collins]</a>: We really need to make sure that these pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13833.823s">[Collins]</a>: And I think people know which camp I'm firmly in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13839.173s">[Collins]</a>: What does sadden me is seeing these two viewpoints, which I think are two positions that we can converse from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13846.215s">[Collins]</a>: We can have discussions from those two poles and not experience division and not experience a crevasse in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13854.977s">[Collins]</a>: To me, I think that we start seeing division in our community when certain people start saying, those people who disagree with you, they are against you, or they are against them, or this is pitting X against Y.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13868.886s">[Collins]</a>: and convince people of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13874.011s">[Collins]</a>: I don't think that that's helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13875.673s">[Collins]</a>: I don't think that that is where we are to be totally honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13878.315s">[Collins]</a>: I know that there's a lot of people who are deeply concerned and have had conversations that haven't been productive or have been offensive, but I actually do not believe at all that this community is divided over these questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13890.927s">[Collins]</a>: And I also just think it's worth noting that at the end of the day, we can have conversations and sometimes those conversations are unpleasant and sometimes those conversations unfortunately are hostile.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13900.536s">[Collins]</a>: But I just fundamentally for ever since we put these on the ballot in June, I am really confused why we are fighting about this because at the end of the day, these questions will be decided in November when we count up the number of people that voted yes and the number of people that voted no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13915.506s">[Collins]</a>: And I think the people that are saying this is dividing you, they want you to feel divided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13920.67s">[Collins]</a>: And I'd say, look at the motivations there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13923.172s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14707.066s">[Collins]</a>: I just echo what President Behrs said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14708.647s">[Collins]</a>: I think that these are questions that, you know, and we'd be happy to liaise as council leadership to set this up with the chief assessor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14714.69s">[Collins]</a>: I think that he'd be able to give you much better information than we can on the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16860.213s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Behrs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16861.454s">[Collins]</a>: I don't have a direct comment to that last question that was made, but I really appreciate it, appreciate the resources that were shared as well and the recommendations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16869.32s">[Collins]</a>: I just wanted to note that it's quite a late hour and we actually have a second meeting to get to after this, so I would not motion, but request that we now proceed to public participation and then adjourn and take up the agenda items on our regular meeting agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=256.4s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for putting this forward, and I motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=272.589s">[Collins]</a>: Yeah, it's in the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=285.084s">[Collins]</a>: Motion to join all the records and reports of committees and then take paper 24483 from the hands of the clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=400.558s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Behrs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=402.219s">[Collins]</a>: This is a hard one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=403.239s">[Collins]</a>: It's been hard over these past few months not having Larry with us in the chambers like he always, always has been for years and years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=411.823s">[Collins]</a>: It's hard to wrap my head around this, and it's hard to sum up so much of what Larry represented, but Larry was so kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=427.833s">[Collins]</a>: He was so generous with his insight and his experience from so many years of working in City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=433.816s">[Collins]</a>: When I joined the Council three years ago, you know, I felt a little out of place, a little, a little new kid on the block.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=442.558s">[Collins]</a>: And this is just one example of how unflaggingly kind a person Larry is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=447.822s">[Collins]</a>: He never, ever treated me any different than any other counselor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=452.285s">[Collins]</a>: He was kind, he was welcoming, he was welcoming, he took me seriously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=455.347s">[Collins]</a>: And I know that that's how he treated absolutely everybody in his orbit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=458.93s">[Collins]</a>: So he will be so missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=461.311s">[Collins]</a>: And I joined my colleagues in sending our most sincere condolences to his family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1578.293s">[Collins]</a>: I would motion for a moment of silence upon passage and also to dedicate this meeting in Larry's honor, though really he deserves a year's worth of council meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1640.139s">[Collins]</a>: I would motion to suspend the rules to take paper 24477.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1643.16s">[Collins]</a>: On the motion to take paper 24477 and 24478 under suspension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1793.793s">[Collins]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1867.355s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1891.139s">[Collins]</a>: Motion to revert to regular order of business, and then to take paper 24457 from the table, to take both national grid papers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2115.61s">[Collins]</a>: I would motion to approve contingent on the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2119.69s">[Collins]</a>: Conditions recommended by the chief engineer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2589.081s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2589.421s">[Collins]</a>: Our first discussion was, I think, at least a month ago now, and it was a very late hour, so I apologize for any failure of perfect eloquence in my trying to summarize our previous discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2602.804s">[Collins]</a>: My understanding is that the cable that needs to be repaired needs to be repaired, and the nature of the request for amendments largely deals with what area of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2612.463s">[Collins]</a>: street will be repaved as a condition of that cable repair, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2617.889s">[Collins]</a>: I'm sorry, say that again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2620.032s">[Collins]</a>: My understanding is that the cable that needs to be repaired, must be repaired, will be repaired, and the nature of the amendments that National Grid has put forward has to do with what area and how much will be repaved while that cable repair is going on, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2639.67s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2640.01s">[Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2640.31s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2640.87s">[Collins]</a>: Just wanted to clarify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2643.191s">[Collins]</a>: Appreciate you being here again, especially at such a late hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2646.112s">[Collins]</a>: I'm so sorry to keep you and your team here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2648.713s">[Collins]</a>: For myself, I think we had a really helpful discussion about a month ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2652.015s">[Collins]</a>: I reviewed the memos from the city's lawyers, from National Grid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2658.458s">[Collins]</a>: I think at this point, I am feeling confident and standing by the amendments that the council in the previous term put forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2666.322s">[Collins]</a>: I really appreciate the discussions that you've had with us about this, but I think that those current, those existing amendments and the council's rationale behind them for me feels as resonant as it did a year ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2679.048s">[Collins]</a>: So I would motion to deny the request for amendments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2908.262s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bares.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2909.362s">[Collins]</a>: I appreciated the discussion of this at our, I think it was our October 2nd committee of the whole, and I would motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2964.93s">[Collins]</a>: Motion to take from the table, paper 23449 and 24458.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=3000.627s">[Collins]</a>: Motion to ordain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=3105.862s">[Collins]</a>: Motion to approve for third reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1058.538s">[Collins]</a>: I'd like to thank Councilor Seng for moving this project forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1062.581s">[Collins]</a>: I know, as was stated, this is something that the Council has been talking about for a long time, at least since 2022, when I know then President Morrell was one of the voices calling out strongly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1073.829s">[Collins]</a>: to make sure that Medford was doing all it could do to protect reproductive reproductive health care is wonder, as well as gender affirming health care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1081.914s">[Collins]</a>: And of course this is a very new draft and we're going to continue to revise this in committee but just for my initial review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1087.037s">[Collins]</a>: I think that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1089.518s">[Collins]</a>: One of the parts of this that really stands out to me that I hope that residents kind of, that I think is very salient and I hope that residents, you know, hear about and understand in this proposed ordinance is the section and again, like draft section C that says no city resources, materials or funds shall be used to facilitate or aid any person seeking to prohibit criminalized sanction, et cetera, the person seeking this kind of care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1112.716s">[Collins]</a>: And I think that's really the point to me here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1114.737s">[Collins]</a>: is that we, I think we know implicitly that it's not appropriate for city resources to be used towards such, you know, essentially extra legal purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1124.78s">[Collins]</a>: And that includes the time of our city employees as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1127.441s">[Collins]</a>: So I'm really proud that we're crafting a policy that enshrines that, and I look forward to continuing to revise this in committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1362.688s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, and sorry, just a clarifying question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1364.409s">[Collins]</a>: I think you already described this, but is the point of that new idea to ensure that pharmacies are complying with providing all of the reproductive health-related medication?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1372.676s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1372.856s">[Collins]</a>: Okay, cool, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1374.097s">[Collins]</a>: I mean, I think that seems part of the theme of these three papers, so I'd be happy to take it up as part of the package.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1689.663s">[Collins]</a>: Oh, sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1690.544s">[Collins]</a>: Just to jump in with, again, preliminary reflections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1694.085s">[Collins]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1694.425s">[Collins]</a>: I think this is, you know, obviously there's a lot of groundwork to lay in terms of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1699.389s">[Collins]</a>: Should we go forward where?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1701.211s">[Collins]</a>: That's kind of step number one in terms of visioning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1704.974s">[Collins]</a>: Step number one in terms of implementation would be thinking through those questions of, how would we bring this about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1709.898s">[Collins]</a>: How much would it cost?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1710.759s">[Collins]</a>: How much would it cost to build?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1711.78s">[Collins]</a>: How much would it cost to maintain, including putting another thing on DPWs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1718.418s">[Collins]</a>: and using that people power.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1720.659s">[Collins]</a>: That's not at all to say that I think we shouldn't do it because it'll take extra resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1723.62s">[Collins]</a>: I think that it's a really good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1725.441s">[Collins]</a>: I think it's a really nice thing to offer to our residents and visitors to this city and to a lot of residents and visitors, it's also a necessary thing that we should be offering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1734.704s">[Collins]</a>: And if this is a difficult project to implement, if it could take five to seven years to put together, maybe it'll take shorter, but maybe it'll take five years to put together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1745.768s">[Collins]</a>: the will and the buy-in and the plans and the money to make this sustainable, then it is good that we're starting now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1751.814s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2017.913s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2018.314s">[Collins]</a>: Yeah, I support the motion, the amended motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2020.656s">[Collins]</a>: And just to further that point, I think that we're at early enough stages here that I'd be curious to hear perspectives from, Councilor Seng mentioned Director Bailey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2030.405s">[Collins]</a>: I also suspect that this is something that Director O'Connor, even if it's slightly more out of her purview, would have some perspective on as this is a health<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2036.471s">[Collins]</a>: health issue and engages with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2038.592s">[Collins]</a>: I'm sure that the prevention and outreach folks have some, you know, they deal with a constituency that would be one beneficiary of these facilities in addition to many, many more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2047.976s">[Collins]</a>: All that to say, gosh, there's so many ways that like a CBA would go with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2053.179s">[Collins]</a>: I mean, I was thinking like this might be the type of thing that we'd want to get the Chamber of Commerce's feedback on because I know that it is kind of a pressure that Main Street businesses have to deal with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2060.422s">[Collins]</a>: We want your patronage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2061.762s">[Collins]</a>: We don't necessarily want to be a restroom facility for people in public, though they need one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2066.044s">[Collins]</a>: So I'd just be really curious to put this pardon me, um, to as many city staff as possible at this early stage because I wouldn't be surprised if we get a lot of support from a lot of different departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2077.109s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2101.371s">[Collins]</a>: Yeah, I think that we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2102.952s">[Collins]</a>: I've certainly made many motions in the past at committee meetings that present a idea proposal or a draft ordinance and send it out to department heads and encourage them at their discretion to get feedback from staff in their department or to just give feedback as department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2154.475s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2154.796s">[Collins]</a>: And I'll just notice for the edification of counselors that haven't done a ordinance process precisely like this before that for me in the past, at least, um, that process is often paired with simply, you know, as as sponsor of the ordinance reaching out to department heads one on one to have conversations about them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2296.633s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2296.993s">[Collins]</a>: Yeah, I appreciate the words from Councillor Seng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2299.935s">[Collins]</a>: And I also just want to note, again, we're talking about something, a project that we're at the very, very preliminary stages of, especially with the restroom facilities and public spaces, which is, you know, more logistical than just us crafting an ordinance and working with city staff to implement it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2316.868s">[Collins]</a>: But also, this is part of a story tradition of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2321.091s">[Collins]</a>: elected and city staff working together to bring online what are essentially logistical or capital expenses, which is a, you know, usually a multi year process, and we've approved some cap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2335.498s">[Collins]</a>: capital expenditures from our stabilization funds recently that are kind of, you know, kind of tell the end of that story where these capital expenses have been requested and advocated for and discussed and budgeted for and plan for for years and then eventually we get the, you know that the planning and the funds come together and we're able to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2355.45s">[Collins]</a>: them together and make an expenditure and bring something online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2358.052s">[Collins]</a>: And in both cases, it's something that we know that we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2360.915s">[Collins]</a>: It's something that pertains directly to the existing needs of residents, and it takes a few years sometimes to bring it into implementation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2367.381s">[Collins]</a>: But I just see that as part of that same process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2369.603s">[Collins]</a>: So again, I appreciate Councilor Sang for bringing this forward, and I think that our discussions about this topic<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2376.229s">[Collins]</a>: to make sure that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2376.709s">[Collins]</a>: Um are well worth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2377.25s">[Collins]</a>: It will be well worth it to residents and visitors to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2380.891s">[Collins]</a>: Um and the same for the ordinances that we're working on in concert to make sure that, um, people in Medford have fallen unfettered access to the rights that they already have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2389.856s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2573.396s">[Collins]</a>: I would just motion to keep all papers in committee and adjourn pending further comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2578.599s">[Collins]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=23.712s">[Collins]</a>: I can't show you anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4389.973s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4390.253s">[Collins]</a>: I'll just keep this pretty brief and high level because the City Council has had a lot of meetings about the issue of private roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4399.776s">[Collins]</a>: City Council has had quite a lot of meetings about the issue of private roads in particular over the past three years that I've been part of the Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4408.936s">[Collins]</a>: What I have learned is that for the city to adopt what is currently a private road is an incredibly expensive process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4414.56s">[Collins]</a>: Obviously, the cost of private roads is expensive to residents, while it's still a private road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4421.625s">[Collins]</a>: For it to become a city on a public road, it has to be fully bought up to par, which is incredibly expensive on the order of millions, so that it can be maintained according to the status quo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4431.043s">[Collins]</a>: And I think that we all know that to improve the city's street canopy, to do that stuff removal that residents have been asking for, that city staff have been trying to do over so many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4440.969s">[Collins]</a>: The point I'm trying to make is that we know that these needs that they're not being filled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4444.551s">[Collins]</a>: We've been trying to make headway on them for such a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4447.253s">[Collins]</a>: The reason that we're not making the headway that residents are really dying to see is because they are so expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4451.915s">[Collins]</a>: And to me, that underlines the need to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4455.577s">[Collins]</a>: use this as a pivot point to try and begin making the investments that will result in visible improvements in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4464.684s">[Collins]</a>: Because we know that there are a lot of residents who would love to at least be on the path towards progress, who would love to see a new private road, be eligible for adoption, and would like to see a more actionable plan for bringing some of those tree stumps down to earth and actually see our tree county expanding in these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4480.895s">[Collins]</a>: And UC Central, they are incredibly expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=238.26s">[Collins]</a>: All right, we're going to get started in just a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=240.461s">[Collins]</a>: Welcome, everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=283.424s">[Collins]</a>: Thanks for bearing with us, everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=297.503s">[Collins]</a>: I believe President Behrs will be joining us in just a minute, so we can give it another couple of moments for folks to get situated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=350.202s">[Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please just let me know whenever you're ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=359.726s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=361.307s">[Collins]</a>: All right, there will be a meeting of the Medford City Council Planning and Permitting Committee, October 23rd, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=366.389s">[Collins]</a>: This meeting will take place at 6.30 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=370.151s">[Collins]</a>: by Zoom only due to early voting in the council chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=374.232s">[Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=410.918s">[Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=411.979s">[Collins]</a>: Five present, none absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=413.38s">[Collins]</a>: The meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=415.763s">[Collins]</a>: The action discussion item for this meeting is again 24-033 zoning ordinance updates with the Innis associates team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=426.094s">[Collins]</a>: This is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=428.55s">[Collins]</a>: an exciting moment in our journey through our zoning update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=432.114s">[Collins]</a>: We have been meeting, of course, with our zoning consultant and associates since the beginning of this term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=440.424s">[Collins]</a>: beginning in July with our mapping workshop, we started our targeted discussions of the Mystic Avenue corridor district, discussing that through July and August, and having more tweaks and changes to the draft proposal over the past couple months with a lot of input from city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=461.771s">[Collins]</a>: We've been continuing those last changes in committee over the past couple meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=467.753s">[Collins]</a>: and tonight I believe that we have a mostly finalized proposal that the zoning consultant has put together for us that councilors got a chance to look at over the weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=477.717s">[Collins]</a>: And I think the intent for tonight is for us to have a final discussion of the Mystic Avenue Corridor District in this committee before it goes out to review by a procedural step at a regular meeting of the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=491.261s">[Collins]</a>: and then review by Community Development Board before it again comes back to the City Council for another hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=497.644s">[Collins]</a>: So we have a short list of the specific pieces of the zoning proposal within the package that Councillors received in their agenda packets last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=512.19s">[Collins]</a>: That kind of break down the proposal into its constituent parts in terms of how it fits into our zoning bylaws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=517.933s">[Collins]</a>: I'm happy to run through those, but I'm sure that our city staff from the planning department or Emily or Paola from Ennis Associates could do a more elegant job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=527.117s">[Collins]</a>: I also want to make sure that we touch on the timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=529.918s">[Collins]</a>: You know, just again, we've been doing this at every meeting, but just to again, kind of recenter ourselves and how we got here at this step in the, at this stage of our timeline, going from several years ago with these kind of goals and visions being formed through our housing production plan and comprehensive plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=547.319s">[Collins]</a>: Um, so I would be happy to, um, recognize, um, Director Hunt or, um, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=551.002s">[Collins]</a>: Um if either of you would like to start us off an<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=576.604s">[Collins]</a>: Yeah, I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=577.325s">[Collins]</a>: Yeah, I'm happy to pass it off to Director Hunt or Emily after a note from Councilor Scarpelli to orient us to what we're reviewing tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=585.833s">[Collins]</a>: But first, go ahead, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=657.714s">[Collins]</a>: I think that a couple ways to answer that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=659.956s">[Collins]</a>: I think that there isn't a plan to have community meetings in between this meeting and when it goes to the regular meeting of the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=667.443s">[Collins]</a>: I will say that everything that this proposal is based on was really forged<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=673.909s">[Collins]</a>: through robust community engagement really over the course of years between city staff planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=681.595s">[Collins]</a>: Pardon me, I'm speaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=683.056s">[Collins]</a>: That was forged through the comprehensive plan formation, which was a year's long community engagement process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=689.501s">[Collins]</a>: I also know that there were certain parts of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=692.583s">[Collins]</a>: the Mystic Avenue Corridor District proposal that we actually pulled back on because we decided that there hadn't been enough robust community engagement when it came to including certain residential streets in that corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=703.951s">[Collins]</a>: We decided we're actually not ready to pull the trigger on that without engaging those specific residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=708.255s">[Collins]</a>: So we've been really conscious of the community buy-in aspect throughout this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=715.48s">[Collins]</a>: And of course, you know, we've been really doing our due diligence over these past few months of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=723.445s">[Collins]</a>: we are doing on the mystic Avenue quarter district proposal in this committee and giving the public every opportunity to add to the community feedback that was already given over the course of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=734.407s">[Collins]</a>: Um on the concert him to on the sorry on the comprehensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=738.328s">[Collins]</a>: Planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=739.448s">[Collins]</a>: Process Um, so I look forward to continuing to welcome the public into these<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=748.75s">[Collins]</a>: this committee is working on and that residents are really, really welcome to part of this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=753.431s">[Collins]</a>: But at this point, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=755.552s">[Collins]</a>: I think that I'm excited to get excited to hear from our city staff and our zoning consultant on exactly if I can follow up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=762.794s">[Collins]</a>: Excuse me, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=764.495s">[Collins]</a>: You can wait until I'm finished speaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=766.695s">[Collins]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=767.896s">[Collins]</a>: I think at this point, it would be important for us to first orient and what we're looking at today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=771.737s">[Collins]</a>: I want us to get oriented on what we're looking at today from, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=824.443s">[Collins]</a>: I'm not sure what you're referring to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=829.945s">[Collins]</a>: I'm just trying to chair a meeting, George.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=831.726s">[Collins]</a>: I'm going to say it up top.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=833.267s">[Collins]</a>: This is a working meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=834.447s">[Collins]</a>: We've had a lot of working meetings over the past few months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=836.448s">[Collins]</a>: We are not going to be interrupting each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=838.168s">[Collins]</a>: I am the chair of this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=839.649s">[Collins]</a>: I will recognize all participants, including counselors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=842.97s">[Collins]</a>: I will not be interrupted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=845.211s">[Collins]</a>: We are going to go through the zoning memo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=846.812s">[Collins]</a>: We are going to have a respectful conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=851.256s">[Collins]</a>: This process was informed by community outreach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=853.899s">[Collins]</a>: That is a fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=855.18s">[Collins]</a>: And if you had concerns about the specific way that we've been doing community outreach through this committee process, you could have brought that up at any time starting in July and not at the 11th hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=863.948s">[Collins]</a>: And I'm just going to say that at the top of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=866.049s">[Collins]</a>: Now I'd like to recognize Director Hunt or Innis Associates to walk us through the memo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=874.048s">[Collins]</a>: Madam Vice President, I'm going to give you one more time and then we're going to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=919.74s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Burris.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=920.721s">[Collins]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1066.411s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Beers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1067.251s">[Collins]</a>: We'll go now to Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1069.652s">[Collins]</a>: For clarity, George, you got to wait for me to recognize you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1072.133s">[Collins]</a>: We're going now to Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1076.475s">[Collins]</a>: Director Hunt, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1976.906s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1977.887s">[Collins]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1978.567s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for the overview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1979.488s">[Collins]</a>: I know that this was a pretty substantial package that counselors received before the weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1984.152s">[Collins]</a>: I know I've given it my review, clarified some things in the text.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1989.977s">[Collins]</a>: I'd like to ask my fellow counselors if there's any questions on this section that they want clarification on before we move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2000.566s">[Collins]</a>: Go ahead, President Burris.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2156.679s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2157.179s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for the question, President Behrs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2158.32s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for weighing in on that, Emily and Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2164.125s">[Collins]</a>: Are there any other questions from councillors on this section of the zoning proposal at this time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2173.737s">[Collins]</a>: Seeing none, Emily, anything else that you wanted to flag from other sections of the four main components of the zoning proposal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2204.571s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2205.233s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2205.794s">[Collins]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2210.117s">[Collins]</a>: Director Hunt or Planner Evans, is there any other, I know for myself, there's plenty that we can speak to that we've been speaking to in terms of the main headlines of what we're looking at tonight, how those fit into the overall zoning structure, where these elements come from, why they are important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2227.388s">[Collins]</a>: We've spoken about that before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2228.329s">[Collins]</a>: I'm happy to speak to that again, but I'd like to defer to city staff first, if there's any other pieces of context or especially important points that you'd like to raise before we discuss our next steps on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2399.13s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2399.911s">[Collins]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2400.652s">[Collins]</a>: And I think that's a really important point that we have to do this work in sections because otherwise it just doesn't make sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2407.999s">[Collins]</a>: It's just not approachable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2409.361s">[Collins]</a>: However,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2411.124s">[Collins]</a>: you know, we can take these books back off the shelf.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2414.745s">[Collins]</a>: All of these components of our zoning, like anything else in our code of ordinances, can be updated, can be amended, we can look at again, we can tweak, we can see what comes up later in this process that informs another change that we decide we actually want to make to the MACD, the Mystic Avenue Border District.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2433.032s">[Collins]</a>: we might.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2433.953s">[Collins]</a>: Find something later in the process that we decide something can be changed to bring more consistency to the citywide zoning map.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2440.716s">[Collins]</a>: Um there's I think it's I'm glad you are reminding us and reminding the public that even though we're kind of breaking this overall project into chunks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2450.86s">[Collins]</a>: Um that's not a door that closes and locks and all of these can continue to be considered in tandem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2738.578s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Barrett, I think those I think those points are really well taken, and I think that it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2744.571s">[Collins]</a>: I think it's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2745.391s">[Collins]</a>: I think that this is a really big job this committee has been attempting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2750.752s">[Collins]</a>: The comprehensive zoning update just on the technical stuff is a lot for one committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2757.593s">[Collins]</a>: And now that we've gone through a couple cycles of packages that this committee has looked at, I'm hoping that we can begin to shoulder a little bit more and pair our next package of updates with indeed improving and adding more to our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2772.956s">[Collins]</a>: how we're communicating about it and how we're communicating about that to the public, to the councillors that aren't on this committee, to city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2782.119s">[Collins]</a>: I think it will help us keep on track and accomplish all that we hope to, to put out that more specific, well, we've put out specific calendars of what we hope to get to and when, and I think that what we need to do now, as you said, is to break that down to an even more granular level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2798.043s">[Collins]</a>: this week and this month, we're looking at this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2799.864s">[Collins]</a>: Two weeks later, we're looking at this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2801.745s">[Collins]</a>: Here's the goal for that month, et cetera, to keep us on track and to make sure that residents, the public business owners, have the best possible chance of knowing, I think I might wanna weigh in on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2813.131s">[Collins]</a>: Okay, I'm gonna save that date on my calendar and make it really easy for folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2817.013s">[Collins]</a>: Go ahead, President Behrs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2984.445s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2985.467s">[Collins]</a>: Yeah, I think there's a lot of things that we could do that would strengthen our signaling overall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2992.926s">[Collins]</a>: Go ahead, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3022.87s">[Collins]</a>: great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3023.21s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3023.891s">[Collins]</a>: Yeah, I think that that would be a great candidate for, uh, the steering committee to look at in advance of the next committee meeting so that we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3031.815s">[Collins]</a>: We already re center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3033.216s">[Collins]</a>: Um, once the Mr Court, Mr Gavin Porter District is on its way, um, to the regular meeting and then the CBB and we can touch base on where we go from here and bring that back to the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3045.784s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3183.916s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3184.696s">[Collins]</a>: President bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3185.176s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3188.898s">[Collins]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3191.363s">[Collins]</a>: We have a great next step in front of us in terms of the zoning proposal before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3199.307s">[Collins]</a>: And I think we have some really great suggestions for how to go forward with our work plan and also pair that with kind of some renewed efforts around how to structure that, how to be telegraphing that structure and what's coming down the pipeline better to all participants, to all stakeholders as we go on in this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3219.576s">[Collins]</a>: Councilor Callahan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3292.964s">[Collins]</a>: Go ahead, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3293.864s">[Collins]</a>: And great question, Councilor Hillian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3398.344s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3399.345s">[Collins]</a>: Councilor Callahan, do you have anything else that you want to add to that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3407.733s">[Collins]</a>: All right, sounds like a no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3409.134s">[Collins]</a>: Councilor Lemmon, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3443.183s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Lemming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3445.244s">[Collins]</a>: Director Hunt, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3476.107s">[Collins]</a>: great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3476.427s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3528.444s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3529.164s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3530.125s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Lohmann.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3530.846s">[Collins]</a>: I appreciate that suggestion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3531.966s">[Collins]</a>: I think that's a good idea to bring another local expert in on that conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3537.65s">[Collins]</a>: If there aren't any other specific questions or comments at this time, I think it might be valuable before we start talking about next steps, a vote on this package and where it goes after it leaves this committee, if that's how the vote goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3551.219s">[Collins]</a>: Emily or Paola, if you wouldn't mind pulling the zoning map up on the screen,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3555.081s">[Collins]</a>: and just quickly giving us a walk through that visual brief description.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3558.543s">[Collins]</a>: Again, I know this is materials we've all seen before, but just to have another look at the updated zoning map with the four sub districts and just to describe once again the characterization of each.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3574.532s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3654.822s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3655.482s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Paula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3656.503s">[Collins]</a>: Appreciate that overview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3658.904s">[Collins]</a>: And again, committee members know this, but just for any residents that didn't catch the past couple meetings when we were also reviewing this map.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3671.246s">[Collins]</a>: on a more, you know, kind of section by section basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3676.148s">[Collins]</a>: This has gone through a couple of minor changes from the original proposal about a month ago, including, you know, finessing, especially on the southern side of the map, where MX3 ends and commercial begins, making that carve out in the commercial zone on the southern side of Mystic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3695.557s">[Collins]</a>: the Hicks area, creating, yes, as Paola is highlighting, inserting mixed-use one, which seems more appropriate for that area, around the residential, the park, and the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3708.421s">[Collins]</a>: So just to highlight some of the small changes that this map went through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3712.922s">[Collins]</a>: I'll recognize Councillor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3754.26s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3754.48s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for the question, Councillor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3756.381s">[Collins]</a>: And just on that, in case it wasn't touched on this meeting, I'm not sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3759.063s">[Collins]</a>: It's my understanding that we are legally required to have that use allowed somewhere in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3764.568s">[Collins]</a>: It's not that we're going out of our way to make sure that adult use establishments are present on Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3769.091s">[Collins]</a>: It's just that we are legally required to have them be allowed somewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3801.558s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for that clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3805.148s">[Collins]</a>: questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3805.408s">[Collins]</a>: Um if there aren't any other questions or comments on the updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3810.351s">[Collins]</a>: Oh, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3810.951s">[Collins]</a>: Planner Evans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3967.88s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Planner Evans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3968.62s">[Collins]</a>: I think that's a really important point to make sure that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3974.045s">[Collins]</a>: environmentally unfriendly, highly pervious surface doesn't get inadvertently grandfathered in while we're waiting, you know, a short number of weeks, it sounds like for the green score to be able to be considered as a global strategy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3988.314s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3991.216s">[Collins]</a>: Any other questions or notes before I start discussing our next steps after this committee meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3999.36s">[Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3999.48s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3999.7s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4000.661s">[Collins]</a>: So, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4002.682s">[Collins]</a>: As is true of all updates to zoning amendments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4006.825s">[Collins]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4008.286s">[Collins]</a>: Now that this has been considered in committee if it were to pass into the next step would be to pass it into a regular meeting with the City Council there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4016.072s">[Collins]</a>: Procedurally it must be immediately referred to the Community Development Board for their review and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4026.839s">[Collins]</a>: and then the two votes to codify it into our into our code of zoning ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4034.924s">[Collins]</a>: So that is another several slate of meetings that we will have to get the input of the planning board and to have it appear before the full assembly of the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4043.649s">[Collins]</a>: That's three more times before it is fully codified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4049.053s">[Collins]</a>: So I always appreciate that in the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4051.627s">[Collins]</a>: Zoning updating process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4052.688s">[Collins]</a>: It's really baked in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4053.489s">[Collins]</a>: You know, there's really no way to avoid a lot of eyes on this highly technical, very important, very consequential changes, and I'm really glad that that is written into the procedure of how this gets done because, of course, we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4067.944s">[Collins]</a>: This step is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4068.704s">[Collins]</a>: It's very detailed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4069.325s">[Collins]</a>: It's very technical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4070.505s">[Collins]</a>: We have to get it right because what we're doing here is we're implementing the goals and visions of the community that was kind of enshrined in the comprehensive plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4078.55s">[Collins]</a>: And I'm grateful that we get to include a lot of hands onto this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4087.294s">[Collins]</a>: Any questions about our next steps in moving this package forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4096.147s">[Collins]</a>: seeing none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4096.767s">[Collins]</a>: So I understand that we have, you know, this short list of tweaks that the zoning consultant will consider in between now and when this goes to the Community Development Board, the changes that we discussed on this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4112.232s">[Collins]</a>: And we'll be sure in our steering meetings to make sure that those are surfaced and make sure that all those boxes are ticked off before this comes back to the City Council for those final two votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4128.444s">[Collins]</a>: Do I hear, before I recognize public participation, is there a motion on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4135.392s">[Collins]</a>: I'll go to public participation first if counselors want to think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4144.283s">[Collins]</a>: I'll recognize Martha Andres.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4147.046s">[Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4248.479s">[Collins]</a>: That's all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4249.999s">[Collins]</a>: Thanks, Martha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4250.66s">[Collins]</a>: Really appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4252.08s">[Collins]</a>: And just to flag what Director Hunt put in the comments, we have these maps up on the website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4257.601s">[Collins]</a>: They are kind of buried, so I don't falter for not being able to find them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4262.382s">[Collins]</a>: It's in the chat under phase two, October 23 meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4266.924s">[Collins]</a>: It's also attached to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4269.969s">[Collins]</a>: the agenda for this meeting on the City Council's public portal, but I'm gonna, well, maybe we can chat about how to just reorder the items on the city's zoning website so that the most current materials are easier to find.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4281.071s">[Collins]</a>: But those are online for you to check out if you'd like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4283.612s">[Collins]</a>: President Behrs, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4382.036s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Behrs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4383.697s">[Collins]</a>: Planner Evans, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4422.747s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Planner Evans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4424.068s">[Collins]</a>: Yeah, I appreciate the suggestion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4425.369s">[Collins]</a>: I think it's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4427.351s">[Collins]</a>: And certainly we would want to give it a thorough look if that recommendation came back to make sure that it's appropriately cited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4440.342s">[Collins]</a>: Councilor Lemmon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4453.348s">[Collins]</a>: Motion to refer out the draft zoning proposal to a regular meeting of the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4461.732s">[Collins]</a>: Is there a second on the motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4470.796s">[Collins]</a>: motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4470.936s">[Collins]</a>: Great seconded by President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4473.677s">[Collins]</a>: Would you like to make your amendment motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4476.018s">[Collins]</a>: We can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4503.853s">[Collins]</a>: second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4508.116s">[Collins]</a>: That was a motion to refer the Mystic Avenue corridor district zoning proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4514.199s">[Collins]</a>: To the next City Council regular meeting and to keep the main paper committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4520.583s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4521.284s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4553.866s">[Collins]</a>: in favor, none opposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4555.827s">[Collins]</a>: Motion passes and the zoning proposal of the Mystic Avenue corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4561.229s">[Collins]</a>: District zoning proposal is referred to the next regular meeting of the City Council, and we will continue our work of, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4569.413s">[Collins]</a>: Going through all of the zoning citywide in this committee in tandem with city stakeholders, the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4581.238s">[Collins]</a>: I want to thank NS Associates for being here as always.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4583.859s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Emily and Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4584.859s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you to our city staff who have been very involved in this project from the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4590.441s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you to all the residents on this call for your attention to this project and for weighing in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4599.303s">[Collins]</a>: Are there any further motions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4607.449s">[Collins]</a>: the motion to adjourn, seconded by President Behrs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4610.512s">[Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4643.792s">[Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4644.533s">[Collins]</a>: Five in favor, none opposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4647.955s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you very much, everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4650.017s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1143.2s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Baird for putting this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1144.8s">[Collins]</a>: I also corresponded with Mr. Bohannon a little bit after he emailed the council and just wanted to reiterate, he was truly so grateful to the two DPW employees who went out of their way to help them out of a, you know, a sticky situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1157.984s">[Collins]</a>: And it was so nice to get such a heartwarming letter about somebody saying, you know, this is what I know to expect from civil servants in Medford and just going out of his way to thank them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1168.007s">[Collins]</a>: So I extend those thanks to our DPW and those two gentlemen in particular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1408.423s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President bears at the planning and permitting meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1411.703s">[Collins]</a>: Last week we met once again with the council's zoning consultant and associates we reviewed the latest draft of the zoning proposal for the mystic Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1423.687s">[Collins]</a>: Trying to get the new acronym, the mystic have Valley District, which is on the city council agenda tonight for us to report out to the Community Development Board which is procedurally the next step in any zoning amendment process so we had a discussion and then we voted it out of committee motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2172.11s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Behrs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2172.87s">[Collins]</a>: And I also want to appreciate the petitioner for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2175.771s">[Collins]</a>: I think it's really important for us to use this forum for folks to have that additional opportunity to say, here are my concerns with the RFP in general, this zone in general, this project in general.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2190.095s">[Collins]</a>: I think there's absolutely, you know, we thank you for, you know, again, voicing how important it is for, you know, everybody who needs access to the senior center and any, however they get there, whether it's by bus or by shuttle, by carpool,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2201.758s">[Collins]</a>: or by driving themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2203.819s">[Collins]</a>: The senior center is so important to Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2206.361s">[Collins]</a>: I'm heartened to see, you know, in the mayor's, in the memo from the planning department that that has been reiterated to some of the development, sorry, some of the developers who went on that site walk, that that's been said to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2217.949s">[Collins]</a>: But I think it's important that we, you know, continue to reiterate this priority, which is a priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2222.592s">[Collins]</a>: We have to make sure that people who need access to the senior center can continue to access it how they need to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2229.197s">[Collins]</a>: So we'll continue to help you emphasize that, and thank you for speaking to your concerns today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4306.607s">[Collins]</a>: To revert to the regular order of meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5259.786s">[Collins]</a>: Nothing major for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5260.587s">[Collins]</a>: I just want to thank the chief for spending some time with us tonight and for answering our questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5374.5s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President bears, I won't go into this and, you know, granular detail because it's been discussed so much in committee and because the council will, because the community will have a couple additional public hearings to really dive into the details if they so choose at the Community Development Board meeting which I believe to scheduled<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5391.87s">[Collins]</a>: November 20 is the date that's been penciled in to review this zoning proposal before it comes back to the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5398.897s">[Collins]</a>: But just before I make the motion to refer to the Community Development Board which again is just procedurally the next step that we have to take before we consider taking a vote on any zoning change to our zoning ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5412.45s">[Collins]</a>: As president bear said we've had many meetings on this district in the planning and permitting committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5418.714s">[Collins]</a>: This is a really exciting juncture for me personally as one counselor because over so many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5428.76s">[Collins]</a>: with people in Medford, you know, not just people in City Hall, but just folks out on the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5433.461s">[Collins]</a>: It comes up so often, how much potential Mystic Ave has and how people look around and say, you know, what's here is really great, but we know this can be so much more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5443.304s">[Collins]</a>: We see a lot of flatland, we see some vacant buildings, we see some lots that seem underdeveloped, and people can see the potential there for things that it's interesting for residents to go to, lots that will be really interesting for developers to want to develop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5458.189s">[Collins]</a>: And in, you know, a lot of potential new commercial growth for our city which I know is really important to all of us and a really shared value for all of us to grow our commercial tax base though so that we can grow without.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5470.672s">[Collins]</a>: having to levy all of that burden onto our residential tax base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5474.956s">[Collins]</a>: So with a lot of the goals, those goals in mind, and with the comprehensive plan, you know, guiding our beginning of this process, we took a look at this district, our zoning consultant was able to propose kind of a slate of sub districts that would make sense for different parts of this corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5491.79s">[Collins]</a>: Of course, this corridor is very heavily commercial, heavily commercial, heavily commercial industrial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5497.514s">[Collins]</a>: ended about some residential areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5499.015s">[Collins]</a>: So we took a lot of care in discussing what parts of that corridor, the north side closer to Medford Square, what type of mixed use involving commercial but not explicitly commercial makes sense for that zone as you get down further south towards Somerville, towards some of the more residential areas, what makes sense there, what's going to be good for development, what will buffer those residential areas from the commercial development that we hope to see there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5523.324s">[Collins]</a>: So we took a lot of time with those questions<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5526.145s">[Collins]</a>: And I'm very proud of the collaboration and the updated proposed zoning map that's come out of that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5534.167s">[Collins]</a>: Of course, all those nitty gritties, the dimensional standards that inform what we're proposing that developers can develop there in each sub-district, depending on the conditions of the sub-district and other incentives that they may or may not take advantage of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5549.63s">[Collins]</a>: All that to say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5551.09s">[Collins]</a>: There's a lot of weeds for people to dig into and I really do recommend that folks watch the meetings of the planning and permitting committee where this was discussed, or attend the Community Development Board meeting on what I believe is going to be November 20, if you want to have an even closer look at some of those details.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5568.82s">[Collins]</a>: But I do want to thank the committee for going through this process I think this is a really important part of the zoning overhaul that this council has been really working very hard<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5578.025s">[Collins]</a>: to make progress on for this entire term and the previous two councils including the one that I wasn't on yet was working really hard to do this zoning work so that the, the things that residents of the community and business owners of the community have been asking the city to move on for such a long time that we're, you know, starting to make some real progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5596.612s">[Collins]</a>: So on that, I would motion to refer this to the Community Development Board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6620.716s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6621.276s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for flagging those Councilor Callahan I know that for, for myself even having spent a lot of time with these documents, it is a lot of material, so thank you for the close read.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6632.802s">[Collins]</a>: I just wanted to note and again this doesn't pertain to the motion that we're making tonight which is just to send this along to the next body which is, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6640.645s">[Collins]</a>: The, the board members who will again look through this for a fine tooth comb but just on the, on the community engagement piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6647.408s">[Collins]</a>: I just didn't want to speak to that again, quickly, just to note that I think, I think it's really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6652.99s">[Collins]</a>: And when I speak to what we're what we're doing and what we've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6655.751s">[Collins]</a>: And that's on any topic not just the zoning it's it's not because I'm trying to make the point that, you know, we're doing a B and C so you know we got a 100%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6666.295s">[Collins]</a>: and we're perfect and we shouldn't do anything more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6668.676s">[Collins]</a>: I think as public servants we always aspire to, you know, in our fantasy version of our jobs we would talk to every single person and of course we can't do that, but I think it's really important that we always aspire to be catching more people, to be going into these projects with the assumption that everybody might have an opinion and if they do then it should be heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6691.753s">[Collins]</a>: I think what is, you know, it is genuinely challenging and this project and many others is that we take that ideal that responsibility to incorporate as much public feedback as we possibly can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6705.477s">[Collins]</a>: And we have to reconcile that with what we can do and what we can say to residents that we are doing so that we're consistent, and so that they have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6715.1s">[Collins]</a>: realistic expectations about where to find us and how we'll find them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6719.124s">[Collins]</a>: So when I say you know I think after the last meeting we had some conversations with the zoning consultant to say, Okay, we've gone through, you know, kind of one and a half zoning packages now we have this proposal we have the proposal of kind of more technical tweaks that we put forward around the end of the fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6734.997s">[Collins]</a>: Now we're kind of in our groove.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6737.219s">[Collins]</a>: You know it's really time to bolster this what what more can we do so that it is so that it is as it should be easier for folks to get involved easier for more people to know what's coming up further ahead of time because that's really important, that is really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6754.184s">[Collins]</a>: And to me, you know what it says, when it comes to, you know, the one proposal to what's ahead of time let's make a schedule for what we're talking about in which month, so that we know so that the city staff knows so that residents can know essentially kind of have this more save the date type format, so that folks can know and really prepare and say okay I have that date in my mind if I want to attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6775.569s">[Collins]</a>: I'll be sure to attend, which is not to say that that's the perfect forum for feedback or that it should be the only forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6784.233s">[Collins]</a>: Knowing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6787.506s">[Collins]</a>: We are a city council in a city that does not yet have the resources for robust public engagement that we want to model ourselves off of that other neighboring communities do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6798.108s">[Collins]</a>: I think that gives us the opportunity to at least be expanding our reach by being able to say ahead of time, here's the meeting on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6806.39s">[Collins]</a>: If it's relevant to you, please save the date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6808.871s">[Collins]</a>: If this format isn't doable for you, you have at least a month to let us know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6813.152s">[Collins]</a>: If you can't get to this meeting,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6815.732s">[Collins]</a>: Let us know send us an email call us if you're a person who has to be engaged in your community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6820.376s">[Collins]</a>: Let us know so that we can find a way to accommodate and come to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6823.778s">[Collins]</a>: What I'm trying to say is, I know that in the scope of this project with so much to cover it might not be, we might not be able to do what I think we all want to do, which is to have multiple community meetings in every neighborhood for every topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6836.828s">[Collins]</a>: We can aspire to that I hope that we can do that especially in some of our more residential neighborhoods, where a lot of care has to be taken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6843.493s">[Collins]</a>: But especially to me as committee chair it is very important that we are able to tell people what to expect and that do that consistently because I think that is really important for access as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6853.401s">[Collins]</a>: So just to note that for going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6855.342s">[Collins]</a>: I'm excited about the, you know, expanded messaging that we're going to be doing as we head into the new year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6865.049s">[Collins]</a>: And just to reiterate that, you know, we're, I'm really grateful to be guided by so many plans that were created in collaboration with the community over the course of years that lay the foundation for everything that we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6876.935s">[Collins]</a>: And that, you know, it shouldn't go without saying that having the community involved in this process is really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6885.219s">[Collins]</a>: And I think as public servants, we're always trying to think about realistically how to do that better and better every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6890.382s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7150.36s">[Collins]</a>: I'm happy to defer to Director Crowley if she would like to present first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7299.12s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for being present, Director Crowley, and for answering our questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7303.622s">[Collins]</a>: I'm always happy to see a contract get resolved and always happy for the opportunity to approve and to waive the second and third readings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7549.983s">[Collins]</a>: I'll motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8695.842s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, Commissioner for being with us tonight, just to again paraphrase this to make sure that I haven't taken a look at that site as well in anticipation of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8704.947s">[Collins]</a>: So just to make sure I have a correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8710.365s">[Collins]</a>: This transfer of the paper way would allow to Joseph Street to reconstruct the retaining wall, which fell down earlier this year and transferring<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8722.745s">[Collins]</a>: Transferring one half the rates would allow them to do that and transferring the rights on the city side would remove us from liability so that they could go about and do their construction in a way that wouldn't implicate the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8732.707s">[Collins]</a>: And it's not like we're going to build a city road on that paper way anyway, due to the grade, it would be dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8739.108s">[Collins]</a>: So that wouldn't come about in the future anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8741.889s">[Collins]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>
