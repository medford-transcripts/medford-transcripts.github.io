    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=955.624s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Barras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=956.325s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being with us here tonight and for all the legwork that you've been doing to get the FY 25 estimated valuations online months earlier than you otherwise would.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=965.791s">[Collins]</a>: Really appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=966.671s">[Collins]</a>: And I appreciate that it helps folks get a clearer picture of what precisely their bills might look like in the future based on various<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=977.478s">[Collins]</a>: how the votes go in various directions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=979.52s">[Collins]</a>: So just to make sure that I understand the information that's available, and it would be, is it on the Assessor's Department page or the Finance Department page on the city website?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1010.909s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1011.19s">[Collins]</a>: So up until today, people can call your office or look on the assessor's department website webpage and find the webpage is going to be dependent on like, I'm going to try to get it up this week, but like, it's just however fast we can do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1025.423s">[Collins]</a>: But<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1026.26s">[Collins]</a>: We have the FY 24 based calculations and now you're expediting getting the FY 25 based valuations so that people can have even more clarity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1036.485s">[Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1036.765s">[Collins]</a>: Well, thank you so much for updating that ahead of schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1038.686s">[Collins]</a>: Appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1823.786s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Behrs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1824.529s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1828.319s">[Collins]</a>: I want to add a disclaimer that I obviously sitting behind this rail on this date, I'm not a school committee member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1834.8s">[Collins]</a>: I don't have that level of granular knowledge of the school department and the school department makes its own budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1840.641s">[Collins]</a>: The city council does not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1842.102s">[Collins]</a>: That being said, I have discussed this matter extensively with people in the community, with people involved in the schools, with school committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1852.524s">[Collins]</a>: I understand that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1854.224s">[Collins]</a>: you know, what we stand to lose if these questions do not pass includes, you know, some of the stuff that people involved in the schools may remember from when we had to cut the school's budget during the pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1867.679s">[Collins]</a>: And that includes eliminating positions, including teachers, nurses, behavioral specialists, literary coaches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1875.568s">[Collins]</a>: We lose the opportunity to add programming within the schools that supplement the curriculum that is state mandated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1883.713s">[Collins]</a>: So, some programming that is really beloved by students and their families, such as arts and musical curricula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1892.297s">[Collins]</a>: We lose the opportunity to augment the student experience with those types of classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1897.44s">[Collins]</a>: We lose the opportunity to augment the student experience with more people in supportive roles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1905.625s">[Collins]</a>: such as therapists, nurses, people outside of the classroom who are nevertheless there to make sure that students can thrive in our schools and achieve the best learning that they can?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1919.275s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1921.256s">[Collins]</a>: These two questions combined also limit our ability to offer competitive and living wages to the many, many people who work in our schools and offer<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1931.823s">[Collins]</a>: students the experience that they really deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1935.005s">[Collins]</a>: We know that we need to be offering living wages to our teachers and paras and all school staff because it's the right thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1940.446s">[Collins]</a>: We also know that we need to be able to do that in order to keep these people in our school system so that our students are served in the way that they deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1949.118s">[Collins]</a>: This will also have impacts on building maintenance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3181.923s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Behrs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3183.224s">[Collins]</a>: I appreciate the discussion from my fellow councilors on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3186.525s">[Collins]</a>: I won't go into the topic of new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3189.146s">[Collins]</a>: My fellow councilors have covered that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3190.947s">[Collins]</a>: We are very optimistic about how the council's current work on zoning and permitting, which we've been keeping up for two terms, will continue to accelerate new growth and augment the city's operating budget to the greatest extent possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3204.334s">[Collins]</a>: I do just want to note that on the issue of free cash, just to, I think,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3208.359s">[Collins]</a>: Different ways of framing the issue are helpful for me, maybe for other people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3215.22s">[Collins]</a>: It's no secret that we accrued free cash over several years, and that was not dispersed into savings accounts where it could be used and spent on capital expenditures because our city, unlike almost every other city and town in Massachusetts, before this year did not have any stabilization accounts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3233.504s">[Collins]</a>: Now we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3234.204s">[Collins]</a>: That means that that money can go to the purposes that I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3237.225s">[Collins]</a>: City staff and many residents really wanted it to be going to expected it to be going to all along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3242.548s">[Collins]</a>: Things like capital expenses and also repairing our infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3246.49s">[Collins]</a>: Putting aside some of that money that's already been allocated to things that people can see out on the street, helping our DPW and other departments improve life and do basic maintenance in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3255.474s">[Collins]</a>: Even if you say, okay, let's forget some of those capital expenditures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3258.476s">[Collins]</a>: Let's pretend that we still have $25 million in free cash, just using an easy number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3263.29s">[Collins]</a>: That's one-eighth of the city's annual operating budget, which means, you know, if it's one-eighth, you can understand how quickly we would run through that if we were using that as things to plug the hole in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3273.975s">[Collins]</a>: And I do want to emphasize that doesn't include any capital expenses whatsoever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3279.618s">[Collins]</a>: Going back to the resident's question on why now, I think it comes down to we know that free cash is not sustainable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3287.581s">[Collins]</a>: We know that we're already full steam on new growth, but we need more and better funding and services for our residents now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3294.686s">[Collins]</a>: And I think the question is, do we want to punish residents and students for past shortcomings by failing to invest now, or do we want to take this opportunity to start making Medford better for all residents and students in the public schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3427.807s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3429.108s">[Collins]</a>: The financial task force was a group explicitly made up of elected to consider the question of what we would put before our elected bodies to deal with solutions around this problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3441.258s">[Collins]</a>: However, I feel really comfortable in saying that all of the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3445.622s">[Collins]</a>: above types of people, city staff, members of the community, were consulted in various ways, formally and informally, throughout this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3454.393s">[Collins]</a>: Some that people talked to, some that members of the financial task force talked to while we were considering these matters that were discussed in our meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3462.183s">[Collins]</a>: Some of that were explicitly consulted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3464.705s">[Collins]</a>: And others that have just been part of this greater conversation around what should we do with about what should we do about chronic underfunding in Medford over the course of months and months and years and years of challenges that have led up to this year in which we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3479.477s">[Collins]</a>: Working together to try to solve these issues once and for all, instead of having budget season after budget season, where the school budget is essentially held hostage by our inability to raise enough money to add to provide the services that residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3494.785s">[Collins]</a>: students and teachers expect and deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3497.567s">[Collins]</a>: And I also just want to underline, again, that these ballot questions, every single resident, every single voter in Medford, whether you're a parent, a teacher, a union member, somebody who works for the city, who also lives in the city, you get to use your voice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3511.436s">[Collins]</a>: You get to cast your vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3512.557s">[Collins]</a>: You can vote yes on all three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3513.738s">[Collins]</a>: You can vote no on all three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3515.019s">[Collins]</a>: You can choose which ones you feel comfortable voting yes and voting no on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3518.141s">[Collins]</a>: You are a part of this conversation because every single person who votes gets a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3523.324s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4089.914s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4091.856s">[Collins]</a>: Again, speaking as a member of the financial task force, I want to try to put this a different way because maybe I wasn't, I want to try putting this differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4101.403s">[Collins]</a>: The financial task force, this group of electeds, tasked with- And the chief of staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4110.911s">[Collins]</a>: As the mayor's staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4114.189s">[Collins]</a>: If I had a staff person, I probably want them with me taking notes as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4120.114s">[Collins]</a>: Our assignment was to create a proposal for a political solution to a community-wide problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4126.18s">[Collins]</a>: And that is why this task force was made up of electeds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4129.242s">[Collins]</a>: I think folks who are asking the question, rightfully so, of why did you come up with what you came up with should<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4139.801s">[Collins]</a>: look to the hours and hours of tape that we have the public meetings that we've had in this chambers between the city council and the school committee where we discussed that question in terms of why seven and a half million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4154.619s">[Collins]</a>: Gosh, there's a lot of school committee meetings enumerating exactly what we cut in various different budget scenarios to back up why we think that this is the number that is at the nexus of what we know that we need and what we think that we can reasonably ask of the residents to strike that sweet spot between<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4171.044s">[Collins]</a>: trying to maintain an equitable and deserved school experience for Medford Public School students with something that the community can be comfortable with and can say yes to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4182.393s">[Collins]</a>: It is our job as people who run for offices, instead of going to planning school and trying to get a job in City Hall, to try to come up with, for lack of a better word, political solutions to real life community-wide problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4195.804s">[Collins]</a>: That is what the task force sought to do, and now everybody gets the chance to vote on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5033.681s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5035.001s">[Collins]</a>: Not to put too fine a point on it, but I think we've all acknowledged behind the rail<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5040.879s">[Collins]</a>: that we have problems this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5042.6s">[Collins]</a>: And let's say hypothetically that our free cash was not already allocated to capital funds that our department heads have been advocating for in many cases for years and years and years and being pushed off because we didn't have the money to allocate towards those capital expenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5057.472s">[Collins]</a>: And now we're finally able to start chipping away at that very, very long list of projects on our capital improvement plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5064.338s">[Collins]</a>: Let's just put aside that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5067.637s">[Collins]</a>: and say, hypothetically, what if we still had unallocated free cash that we could use on an operating budget, which we don't because it's allocated to capital projects?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5077.041s">[Collins]</a>: I think that there's a shared acknowledgment behind this rail that that does put us back at square one, and we have to revisit this conversation again in May for fiscal 26 with no better solutions than we do now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5089.566s">[Collins]</a>: So I've asked myself,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5091.852s">[Collins]</a>: What would I cut if we then approaching fiscal 26 with no better off because new growth takes five to 10 years to really flourish into that robustly improved commercial tax base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5105.555s">[Collins]</a>: And we haven't taken advantage of accelerating our tax levy so that we can try to get in fighting distance of where inflation has put us as a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5118.092s">[Collins]</a>: And now we don't have the cash reserves that again are hypothetical at this point because we already know that we need them for capital expenses and we have to balance the budget for fiscal 26.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5127.715s">[Collins]</a>: What would I cut?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5130.016s">[Collins]</a>: There's nothing to cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5131.176s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5310.994s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5311.274s">[Collins]</a>: I'm sure that my fellow councilors will add to this list, but just to reference some of the data points that have been coming up multiple times in this meeting in particular, I'd guide you to the pavement management plan that was put out by the DPW some years ago, and that's a few years out of date now, but it details the- It was actually updated last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5328.939s">[Collins]</a>: Oh, nevermind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5329.819s">[Collins]</a>: Updated last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5331.219s">[Collins]</a>: That details the $200 million in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5337.401s">[Collins]</a>: backlog of road repairs that are needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5340.123s">[Collins]</a>: For more detail on the needs in the schools, I would direct you to really any of the budget cycles, the recent budget cycles, school committee meetings, FY23 or FY24, which I think go into the level of detail that folks are really curious about when it comes to what is at stake, what actually does go on the chopping block each year, and that is brought back depending on ESSER funding, when that was available, or other one-time funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5362.429s">[Collins]</a>: And I think that the capital improvement plan is also a really interesting augment to those operating costs that show how much money really needs to be funded to on the infrastructural and maintenance side that we are really waiting to have the funding for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7486.193s">[Collins]</a>: Mine is related to a different part of the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7592.861s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, and just quickly to follow up on that, I'll note that, again, to echo what President Behr said, it's not within the purview of this council to have any input on the design of the fire headquarters, but I will note for folks who might be interested, on the city website under the fire department webpage, there are links to six of the concept plans that were published this year, which I think is interesting for folks, for residents who want a little bit more detail, because it actually enumerates what's different in each design from the one preceding it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7910.986s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7912.047s">[Collins]</a>: Um, again, as a city council member, not involved in the school's department budgeting process, but I would just say, considering these questions,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7923.373s">[Collins]</a>: thinking about the motives behind them in terms of the motives for community, the motives politically for putting these forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7931.682s">[Collins]</a>: It's hard for me to imagine, even putting on my cynical hat, what our gain could possibly be in putting forward<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7940.677s">[Collins]</a>: a question that asks residents to pay more in taxes to then spend it on spurious things in the schools department when we know, because we hear from residents all the time, all year long in school department meetings, in school committee meetings and in city council meetings, the adverse effects on students and teachers and staff because of underfunding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7962.072s">[Collins]</a>: And the ways that we want to see the school experience be better for students that we can't yet afford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7968.415s">[Collins]</a>: It's it's hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7969.735s">[Collins]</a>: We have no motivation to raise this money and then spend it on things that are not the things that the community has already been in some cases really begging city leadership to spend it on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7984.265s">[Collins]</a>: I'm not involved in the weeds of the school's department budgeting process the way that the school committee is in the way that the school's department is, but there is, it's just impossible for me to imagine a scenario where this money will be spent on 30 seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8001.633s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8004.821s">[Collins]</a>: The goal of doing this very difficult thing, which indeed is causing a lot of difficult conversations in the community, is to improve life for Medford public school students, life and conditions for Medford residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8018.344s">[Collins]</a>: It would be... 10 seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8021.585s">[Collins]</a>: It would be bizarre for us to spend it away on various things that weren't directly related to improving quality of life for residents and students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8681.817s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8684.56s">[Collins]</a>: Obviously, there's been a lot said in this Q&A forum, and I just think that with everything else that we've been hearing, I also want to put on the record that we talked about the costs if the overrides should pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8697.174s">[Collins]</a>: The assessor gave a great presentation earlier about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8700.356s">[Collins]</a>: how costs will go up regardless, how costs will go up if seven passes, how costs will go up if both pass, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8708.463s">[Collins]</a>: And that's significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8709.824s">[Collins]</a>: I think that is significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8710.704s">[Collins]</a>: I think that people should take it seriously and decide how they feel about it and if they think that they can afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8715.108s">[Collins]</a>: And what if any exemptions apply to them and how those will work with them and call the assessor if they have questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8720.032s">[Collins]</a>: I also think that what also deserves a serious and honest discussion is how households and individuals end up paying out of pocket if we continue to not fund our public sector, if we continue to let our roads and sidewalks get worse and worse and worse, which is something to be taken seriously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8740.018s">[Collins]</a>: It is a safety issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8741.519s">[Collins]</a>: It is an accessibility issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8743.179s">[Collins]</a>: If we continue to let our schools get worse and keep missing every opportunity to make them get better,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8753.203s">[Collins]</a>: I think it is frankly condescending to build this discussion as nothing more than trying to scare people into voting a certain way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8764.205s">[Collins]</a>: For the people who think, wow, what if the schools are no longer an environment where my student can learn or thrive?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8771.246s">[Collins]</a>: I cannot pay for a tutor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8773.187s">[Collins]</a>: I cannot pay for five-day school tuition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8775.467s">[Collins]</a>: I am concerned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8778.388s">[Collins]</a>: We should not be belittling that emotion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8780.575s">[Collins]</a>: We should not be belittling people who are having to pay out of pocket every year for car repairs, because we can't take care of the most basic thing in our city in a way that makes it not quite so obvious when you drive from Winchester into Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8797.645s">[Collins]</a>: The format of this discussion was supposed to be a Q&A session where residents can ask questions and counselors could give answers to the best of their ability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8805.53s">[Collins]</a>: I am pretty disappointed that it's turned into an event where certain counselors are telling residents not how they should vote, but how they should feel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9307.898s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9308.258s">[Collins]</a>: I'll be quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9309.139s">[Collins]</a>: Just a quick point of information because I know it's been said a few times tonight that the $500,000 would quote, fix the roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9316.463s">[Collins]</a>: I think that as the published pavement management plan on the city website establishes that we have $200 million in a backlog of road repairs in the city, I think we're all very aware<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9327.529s">[Collins]</a>: that half a million dollars is not going to fix the roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9330.79s">[Collins]</a>: As it says in the text of the question, what this would do is enable the DPW to establish, as it reads, additional staff for road and sidewalk infrastructure repair, which relates to the in-house hot top crew that Councilor Scarpelli has been advocating for for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9344.216s">[Collins]</a>: So Councilor, I'm sad to hear that you've reversed your position on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9902.296s">[Collins]</a>: No, I mean, if you have more detail to add on the Cambridge Fire Station example, I just think that we covered this question earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10513.008s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10513.408s">[Collins]</a>: Just in brief, obviously we know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10517.418s">[Collins]</a>: That's really tough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10518.199s">[Collins]</a>: And we know that the student experience coming out of the pandemic when so much critical in classroom learning time was missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10523.184s">[Collins]</a>: That's really tough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10523.985s">[Collins]</a>: It's really tough for a lot of students feel for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10528.089s">[Collins]</a>: I will just say that I know the topic of literacy coaches in classroom specifically came up a lot in school committee budget meetings and city council budget meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10539.08s">[Collins]</a>: And as we were discussing, putting together these numbers for Proposition 7 and Proposition 8 specifically, because we know that that is such a need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10547.184s">[Collins]</a>: One of my big concerns if the overrides don't pass is that we would not be able to bring online the literacy coaches that we know that students like your son really need more of in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10558.31s">[Collins]</a>: And if they do pass, we would be empowered to be able to have more of those coaches in the schools helping students make up for the time that they lost during the pandemic and just due to other factors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11568.814s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11569.234s">[Collins]</a>: Appreciate the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11573.024s">[Collins]</a>: I am normally actually and every single penny every single nickel counts type of person in my household budget, certainly, you know, we take every penny very seriously and municipal budgeting because this is our collective wealth to do with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11588.789s">[Collins]</a>: in all of the discussions in public meetings, city council meetings, school committee meetings, task force meetings around what is the number that we should put forward that we're asking people to vote for to invest in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11599.931s">[Collins]</a>: I spent a lot of those meetings advocating for a much, much, much higher number than just 7.5 to be spread around the DPW and the schools and other expenses, but mostly the schools, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11610.293s">[Collins]</a>: And I think when we're having those discussions that are essentially landing at this is the minimum amount that we can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11616.909s">[Collins]</a>: try to invest in our schools to have to at least hold the line and prime the pump for them then getting better in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11624.331s">[Collins]</a>: Maybe not even get better this year, but at least keep them from backsliding so we can hope to have them improve in future fiscal years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11632.454s">[Collins]</a>: When $7 million is the scope of the investment, that is essentially the minimum for not backsliding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11639.576s">[Collins]</a>: You put that against a 2% COLA for certain electeds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11644.372s">[Collins]</a>: and bringing up other electeds to not even parity with that position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11649.773s">[Collins]</a>: I think if we're having an honest discussion, we can all look at that and say apples and oranges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12062.916s">[Collins]</a>: Part of our discussion has been around the salaries that this year are currently on one-time funds that will expire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12070.119s">[Collins]</a>: And putting forward the override questions as an on-ramp for those positions is, again, once that one-time funding that they're currently being funded by has been depleted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12080.542s">[Collins]</a>: But in your clarification, I think that my point might have been usurped by something else that you were saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12091.038s">[Collins]</a>: Only if you have one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12093.359s">[Collins]</a>: No, I'm good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12324.554s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12325.374s">[Collins]</a>: Really fair question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12326.194s">[Collins]</a>: I'm glad that you asked it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12327.775s">[Collins]</a>: In terms of what's directly within our purview as city councilors, I know for as long as I've been on the council, I'm in my second term now, we have been, I think, extremely focused on parts of our jurisdiction that relate directly to expanding commercial tax base, which is the ways that we can increase city revenue without going to residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12348.234s">[Collins]</a>: We've been talking a lot about our zoning project, especially recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12351.074s">[Collins]</a>: It didn't begin recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12352.655s">[Collins]</a>: We've been fighting for, I think, three terms, since longer than I've been on the council, to be able to work with a zoning consultant to do really smart, tailored zoning that will allow us to grow the parts of the city that people have been wanting to see growth in for years, so that we'll see what we wanna see there, and also be adding to our commercial tax base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12370.078s">[Collins]</a>: And we've been starting to do that, and we're already starting to see the seeds of results on Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12375.119s">[Collins]</a>: Of course, that revenue isn't gonna come online<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12378.467s">[Collins]</a>: until like a longer timescale than we really, that's not, we don't see the rewards from that in one year, we see that in five, 10, 20 years, but that is directly within our jurisdiction, and we've been extremely focused on this council, on laying the groundwork for commercial tax-based growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12393.988s">[Collins]</a>: City Hall departments, I think, are really, one of the things that they're remarkable for is in grant-seeking, especially our Planning Development Sustainability Office, and I do know that every department in this city works really hard to get grant funding for some of its essential projects or other projects that we don't have to take those monies out of the operating budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12413.178s">[Collins]</a>: The City Council, whenever we can, we support those grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12417.08s">[Collins]</a>: We approve when that's within our jurisdiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12419.041s">[Collins]</a>: We try to support<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12421.582s">[Collins]</a>: resources, funding for projects coming from not from residents, wallets, essentially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12428.285s">[Collins]</a>: In addition, then there's the advocacy side and people bringing up, what is the state doing about this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12433.267s">[Collins]</a>: What is the state paying and how are other players paying in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12436.149s">[Collins]</a>: We constantly advocate for an increase in trying to remember what this UGGA actually stands for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12443.012s">[Collins]</a>: I think it's unrestricted, like general aggregation, constantly advocating for the state to pay into cities like Medford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12450.755s">[Collins]</a>: more so that we can do more for our residents the way that the state would like us to do, constantly advocating for changes in the payment in lieu of tax agreement laws so that we can turn to institutions like Tufts and say, hey, you don't pay a lot of property tax, all of our other residents do, let's make this more fair, trying to pull what levers we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13215.882s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13216.122s">[Collins]</a>: I just want to thank you for being here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13217.862s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you for your advocacy on this issue, and thank you for advocating for firefighters in general in Medford all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13226.184s">[Collins]</a>: I understand that this is complicated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13227.404s">[Collins]</a>: I also know that as a city council, we approach this at different levels of distance from just the dollars and cents of the proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13234.944s">[Collins]</a>: And from the specifics of the fire headquarters proposal that is being worked out between the fire department, maybe fire department leadership is more accurate to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13246.252s">[Collins]</a>: And principally the mayor's office, we're not involved in that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13249.794s">[Collins]</a>: I can say for myself as one counselor that after hearing for so many months and years, this is an improved headquarters is urgently needed, urgently deserved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13257.541s">[Collins]</a>: the fire department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13259.163s">[Collins]</a>: Um, that that is trying to bring that about as expeditiously as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13263.428s">[Collins]</a>: It's my priority as a city counselor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13265.83s">[Collins]</a>: Um, I know from, you know, just following the publications of the, you know, kind of continually updated concept drafts that's put out by the mayor's office that, um, you know, at least from what I from what I'm able to see, it seems like feedback is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13278.945s">[Collins]</a>: continuing to be incorporated and updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13280.846s">[Collins]</a>: Again, I'm just sharing what's visible on my side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13283.147s">[Collins]</a>: I know that there's another perspective that you represent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13287.57s">[Collins]</a>: It is my sincere hope from hearing that this is so urgently needed for so long that we are able to see a truly collaborative process that results in the fire headquarters that the fire department needs, deserves, expects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13304.719s">[Collins]</a>: that we can move on with this urgency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13307.74s">[Collins]</a>: And, you know, I think that that's just what the community needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13310.501s">[Collins]</a>: Certainly that's what the fire department needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13311.962s">[Collins]</a>: And I hope that we can do that on a timeframe that we can move on it this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13316.924s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13801.986s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13802.326s">[Collins]</a>: Appreciate the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13803.146s">[Collins]</a>: Obviously, I'm going to give a highly subjective answer because this isn't really a policy question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13807.947s">[Collins]</a>: You know, obviously, I'm really saddened to see<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13812.759s">[Collins]</a>: Well, let me start here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13814.359s">[Collins]</a>: I really understand why people are so concerned about these questions from both sides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13820.461s">[Collins]</a>: I see people saying, wow, my bills are going to go up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13822.701s">[Collins]</a>: That's really serious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13824.181s">[Collins]</a>: And I need to understand why that's being proposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13826.482s">[Collins]</a>: I can also see people saying, wow, these things that these questions would pay for are really dire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13832.123s">[Collins]</a>: We really need to make sure that these pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13833.823s">[Collins]</a>: And I think people know which camp I'm firmly in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13839.173s">[Collins]</a>: What does sadden me is seeing these two viewpoints, which I think are two positions that we can converse from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13846.215s">[Collins]</a>: We can have discussions from those two poles and not experience division and not experience a crevasse in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13854.977s">[Collins]</a>: To me, I think that we start seeing division in our community when certain people start saying, those people who disagree with you, they are against you, or they are against them, or this is pitting X against Y.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13868.886s">[Collins]</a>: and convince people of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13874.011s">[Collins]</a>: I don't think that that's helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13875.673s">[Collins]</a>: I don't think that that is where we are to be totally honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13878.315s">[Collins]</a>: I know that there's a lot of people who are deeply concerned and have had conversations that haven't been productive or have been offensive, but I actually do not believe at all that this community is divided over these questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13890.927s">[Collins]</a>: And I also just think it's worth noting that at the end of the day, we can have conversations and sometimes those conversations are unpleasant and sometimes those conversations unfortunately are hostile.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13900.536s">[Collins]</a>: But I just fundamentally for ever since we put these on the ballot in June, I am really confused why we are fighting about this because at the end of the day, these questions will be decided in November when we count up the number of people that voted yes and the number of people that voted no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13915.506s">[Collins]</a>: And I think the people that are saying this is dividing you, they want you to feel divided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13920.67s">[Collins]</a>: And I'd say, look at the motivations there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13923.172s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14707.066s">[Collins]</a>: I just echo what President Behrs said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14708.647s">[Collins]</a>: I think that these are questions that, you know, and we'd be happy to liaise as council leadership to set this up with the chief assessor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14714.69s">[Collins]</a>: I think that he'd be able to give you much better information than we can on the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16860.213s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Behrs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16861.454s">[Collins]</a>: I don't have a direct comment to that last question that was made, but I really appreciate it, appreciate the resources that were shared as well and the recommendations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16869.32s">[Collins]</a>: I just wanted to note that it's quite a late hour and we actually have a second meeting to get to after this, so I would not motion, but request that we now proceed to public participation and then adjourn and take up the agenda items on our regular meeting agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=23.712s">[Collins]</a>: I can't show you anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4389.973s">[Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4390.253s">[Collins]</a>: I'll just keep this pretty brief and high level because the City Council has had a lot of meetings about the issue of private roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4399.776s">[Collins]</a>: City Council has had quite a lot of meetings about the issue of private roads in particular over the past three years that I've been part of the Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4408.936s">[Collins]</a>: What I have learned is that for the city to adopt what is currently a private road is an incredibly expensive process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4414.56s">[Collins]</a>: Obviously, the cost of private roads is expensive to residents, while it's still a private road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4421.625s">[Collins]</a>: For it to become a city on a public road, it has to be fully bought up to par, which is incredibly expensive on the order of millions, so that it can be maintained according to the status quo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4431.043s">[Collins]</a>: And I think that we all know that to improve the city's street canopy, to do that stuff removal that residents have been asking for, that city staff have been trying to do over so many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4440.969s">[Collins]</a>: The point I'm trying to make is that we know that these needs that they're not being filled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4444.551s">[Collins]</a>: We've been trying to make headway on them for such a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4447.253s">[Collins]</a>: The reason that we're not making the headway that residents are really dying to see is because they are so expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4451.915s">[Collins]</a>: And to me, that underlines the need to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4455.577s">[Collins]</a>: use this as a pivot point to try and begin making the investments that will result in visible improvements in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4464.684s">[Collins]</a>: Because we know that there are a lot of residents who would love to at least be on the path towards progress, who would love to see a new private road, be eligible for adoption, and would like to see a more actionable plan for bringing some of those tree stumps down to earth and actually see our tree county expanding in these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4480.895s">[Collins]</a>: And UC Central, they are incredibly expensive.<br><br>
