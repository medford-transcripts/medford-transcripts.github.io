 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/egZJOUPL-iU&t=10687.461s">Hi,</a> Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/egZJOUPL-iU&t=10690.802s">So</a> meat packaging, takeout containers, pizza boxes, pet waste and diapers are just a few items that attract rats and are neither compostable nor recyclable. <a href="https://youtu.be/egZJOUPL-iU&t=10701.186s">Bi-monthly</a> trash pickup is negligent and ignores the social contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/egZJOUPL-iU&t=10705.327s">No</a> other city is doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/egZJOUPL-iU&t=10707.148s">It</a> is unsanitary and our rat population will explode. <a href="https://youtu.be/egZJOUPL-iU&t=10711.049s">I</a> have to keep my compost bin in the house because it was outside for one week and was all caught up. <a href="https://youtu.be/egZJOUPL-iU&t=10716.471s">Our</a> trash cans don't even close as well as the compost bins. <a href="https://youtu.be/egZJOUPL-iU&t=10719.832s">This</a> will hit the dense environmental justice neighborhoods the hardest, and increasing our density will worsen it more still. <a href="https://youtu.be/egZJOUPL-iU&t=10727.315s">With</a> our current rat problems, was the Board of Health consulted about this change? <a href="https://youtu.be/egZJOUPL-iU&t=10732.457s">What</a> Malden looked like during the trash strike will become our new normal. <a href="https://youtu.be/egZJOUPL-iU&t=10736.999s">Bi-monthly</a> trash pickup is disgusting and irresponsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/egZJOUPL-iU&t=10740.901s">We</a> should not encourage our rat population to grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/egZJOUPL-iU&t=10744.342s">This</a> is a basic service. <a href="https://youtu.be/egZJOUPL-iU&t=10746.463s">And</a> if it is about money, then we need to find something else to cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/egZJOUPL-iU&t=10750.224s">If</a> it is just about chasing a $200,000 grant, then we need to let that one go in the interest of our quality of life, because this is neither good nor feasible. <a href="https://youtu.be/egZJOUPL-iU&t=10760.508s">And</a> I wonder what else is hidden inside this contract that we'll only find out in paragraph 11 of a press release about a grant that is supposed to be good with the bad hidden beneath. <a href="https://youtu.be/egZJOUPL-iU&t=10770.712s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6244.358s">Hi,</a> Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6246.319s">I'm</a> in favor of MX1. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6248.419s">It's</a> more appropriate for this block. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6250.12s">The</a> pit has a variance for one parking space per unit and could only achieve three stories with commercial and two levels of residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6257.682s">The</a> 360 Sound Street project is seeking high frequency transit 0.8 parking spaces and could only achieve four stories with commercial and three residential floors, even though it doesn't qualify for high frequency transit. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6269.526s">So</a> zoning isn't feasible here without removing parking minimums. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6272.406s">Is</a> that what this council is planning? <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6274.307s">Because</a> without that, there's no reason for MX2 here. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6277.569s">We</a> don't wanna risk a methadone dispensary because it fits neighborhood medical with the exception of the hours of operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6284.174s">And</a> there's no reason to believe there couldn't be an exception or they couldn't just follow those hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6288.396s">So</a> we want no medical uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6290.118s">It's</a> too close to the neighborhood and the school to be allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6296.005s">Most</a> of the people who spoke in favor of the zoning mistakenly thought it would allow affordable housing, which means they didn't understand what they were in favor of. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6303.687s">So</a> those counts should be redone to find out who was actually in favor of what is actually proposed here. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6309.468s">The</a> comprehensive plan calls for study, not zoning based on the opinion of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6314.77s">I</a> think many are misinterpreting or misunderstanding the comprehensive plan and its function. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6320.194s">but</a> the neighborhood negotiated with the consultant and planning and President Bears was there and we overwhelmingly wanted MX-1 with no medical uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6329.919s">So</a> this neighborhood was heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6331.7s">We</a> didn't get all that we wanted. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6333.361s">This</a> was a compromise that we made. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6336.303s">You</a> should vote for this change because it's the right thing to do and a more feasible option. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6341.085s">Even</a> MX-1 is highly unlikely to be possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6344.551s">The</a> Community Development Board recognized this in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6347.952s">This</a> council voted against this initially, but we should not be leveraged used by this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6353.773s">Our</a> zoning is live, unlike most of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6356.794s">And</a> Alicia Hunt says this area was urgent to zone because of developer activity and developer pressure. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6363.215s">So</a> this is not something that won't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6365.196s">This</a> is something that is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6367.276s">So</a> we need action now and not to be part of some elaborate plan to gain funds and leverage later. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6373.898s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21294.107s">Hi,</a> Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21296.926s">What</a> stands out to me is there's no call for study or analysis in this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21301.289s">So</a> opinions will still be the entire basis for the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21304.392s">There's</a> no set timeline or process outlined here. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21307.254s">Why</a> was this not brought forward in the planning and permitting committee in coordination with the mayor's office to create a real timeline and specific processes that might happen before new zoning is written? <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21316.861s">The</a> zoning should be called back to planning and permitting and properly written. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21320.803s">The</a> unstudied Salem Street and Mystic Ave zoning should not remain intact. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21324.604s">They</a> were subjected to the same lack of analysis and study, so deserve the same treatment as the NR district's need. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21330.485s">Reverting</a> Park and Salem to MX2 added two floors of height and all the uses that were taken out as too close to the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21337.987s">So</a> we resent that you're saying it's one change was not adopted. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21341.788s">The</a> parking minimum should be set before any zoning is passed and should reflect actual conditions, as even President Bierce has admitted cars are the primary transportation residents use. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21351.65s">So</a> the OR item to remove parking minimums is in direct contradiction of the reality of car ownership in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21358.311s">There</a> is no urgency to rezone and no need to rezone poorly. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21362.812s">There</a> are existing conditions analysis that must be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21366.273s">Impacts</a> must be considered. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21368.248s">low</a> to our infrastructure have to be factored in. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21370.971s">All</a> of these measures are called for in the comprehensive plan, climate plan, and housing production plan that this body mentions frequently, but is not following. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21380.961s">You</a> are not following any of these plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21382.963s">It</a> is not as simple as quote, we just need density. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21386.166s">The</a> new zoning as written encourages luxury housing and discourages affordable housing in many ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21392.596s">It</a> does not encourage businesses or vibrant commercial areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21396.838s">Oversimplifying</a> this process will be to our detriment. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21400.499s">A</a> strong path forward must include analysis. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21403.84s">If</a> Ennis is unable to perform the work appropriately, then perhaps we now should seek a different consultant. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21410.243s">Our</a> zoning is too important to be written without any solid basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21413.984s">Doing</a> something poorly and causing harm is not better than doing nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21419.085s">Opinions</a> are not enough, no matter whose opinions they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21422.73s">That's</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21424.011s">Thanks.</a> <h2><a href="../2025-07-10_-nzz6eWSWpU/2025-07-10_-nzz6eWSWpU.html">Community Development Board 07-09-25</a></h2>

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6384.128s">Hi,</a> I'm Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6388.171s">And</a> I know I've said this first part before, but this board and the public have been asking for documentation ahead of meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6395.497s">I</a> didn't have time today to look an hour before the meeting, which is actually early for us, as most of the time it's posted during the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6402.923s">How</a> often am I expected to check if I want to look at the data before the meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6407.486s">and</a> I often come up empty. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6409.127s">It</a> feels deliberate and disrespectful. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6411.409s">If</a> we can't keep up, we need to slow down. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6414.291s">We</a> aren't setting this pace. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6418.014s">The</a> public isn't setting this pace. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6419.455s">There</a> is no rush just because people who haven't read this are saying because it isn't available or saying it looks good to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6425.919s">It</a> doesn't look good because it doesn't really exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6428.801s">We</a> need to do this right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6429.942s">I</a> had seconds to review part of this, so I'm not sure if this question <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6434.97s">is</a> valid or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6436.631s">Is</a> the new building coverage definition going to include the state required to be allowed ADU in the percentage, which I thought was not allowed to be included in the density amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6447.799s">Could</a> this prevent most homeowners from adding an ADU if they aren't adding it to an existing structure? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6454.444s">It</a> appears that a covered porch will count towards the lot coverage and could prevent someone from having an ADU. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6462.957s">So</a> that's my one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6464.318s">And</a> then just another part is that we're keep referring to the comprehensive plan, which was mostly a wishlist and a list of studies to conduct and strategies to come up with before we zoned. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6476.044s">It</a> was written by a group of consultants, including Ennis and maybe members of the planning department with slides being created before any community feedback had been gathered that had selected quarters and such already in them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6489.692s">and</a> the pictures and the colored circle stickers at some community events during COVID with a majority of the public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6497.174s">I</a> don't know why there's so much confusion that this is being used as a roadmap for zoning changes without any study, even if it was based on community feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6506.756s">The</a> old slide decks still exist online and I have read the plan and the slideshows shown to the public and encourage others to do so before claiming it's supposed to be informing our zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6517.678s">Please</a> do this properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6519.459s">Sound</a> Street is an example of doing things poorly and quickly, and that also deserves to be revisited later. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6525.6s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5853.924s">Hi,</a> I'm Cheryl Rodriguez at 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5857.406s">I</a> noticed that some of these extra conversations tonight about things that weren't before the board are a little confusing to members of the public, but I'm curious about how the NR zoning is now being passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5870.072s">by</a> the square zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5871.893s">And</a> the square zoning has some of the areas like, for example, West Medford Square zoned more densely than they are in the NR maps. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5880.477s">So</a> I'm wondering how they're going to reconcile that if just the square zoning passes first, then the NR zoning will down zone the square areas, particularly the UR areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5892.322s">Also,</a> when I'm looking at the Medford Square map, I noticed that the very large lots on the north side of High Street and Square are only zoned as NR2. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5900.274s">Um,</a> which is pretty low considering they're right on high street and the sound street corridor was given no such exemptions despite having no rapid transit or a large square that would support the density. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5911.298s">So</a> that seems misplaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5912.719s">I</a> did mention it at the subcommittee meetings and it was ignored and bypassed. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5916.957s">Um,</a> NR3 and West in the rapid transit circle exactly matches the density of Glenwood, which again, we don't have any rapid transit. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5924.886s">So</a> it seems right inside that quarter mile circle that West is zoned pretty low. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5929.691s">And</a> if <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5931.85s">Glenwood</a> is going to stand, and they should stand taller than us. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5936.132s">I</a> noticed tonight we're talking about design and development standards, and Salem Street was placed on one of the maps that you showed that now we're concerned about shadow study. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5945.515s">When</a> the Salem Street neighbors rallied and asked for shadow studies, we were told that that wasn't done. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5950.777s">We</a> were quite shut down. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5952.738s">And</a> it's very concerning that the Salem Street zoning is live right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5956.879s">It</a> doesn't have any of these design standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5959.661s">It</a> can happen just the way that it is with no regard for shadow. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5963.044s">So</a> I'm not sure why we didn't wait to allow the zoning to be used before the design standards when there's so much developer pressure on Sale Street that we were rushing to get the zoning through so the developers wouldn't miss the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5975.012s">And</a> now those buildings can happen without consideration of our sunlight or design standards because those things don't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5982.274s">So</a> I feel that it can be too little too late for many of us here on the South Street quarter. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5987.436s">And</a> I wish that more attention and study had been paid to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5990.637s">I'm</a> glad to see that now some of the other areas are getting more attention than we ever got. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5995.838s">But</a> I'm concerned that suddenly the city is also notifying about the neighborhood zoning, eight meetings into the neighborhood zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=6003.072s">so</a> that people didn't find out ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=6005.452s">And</a> now we're scrambling and that's why it's taking extra meetings because people have questions because they're just finding out about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=6011.753s">So</a> I know that there's an urgent rush for the city council and I appreciate that this board is not responding to their pressure and is taking their time and trying to look through these proposals. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=6022.755s">But</a> I hope that when we do the cleanup that we can remember the areas that we really rushed through and didn't give as much consideration and thought as the areas that we're doing now. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=6031.857s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-05-28_IdMgzj9PVYQ/2025-05-28_IdMgzj9PVYQ.html">CPlanning and Permitting Committee Meeting 05-28-25</a></h2>

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7250.565s">Cheryl</a> Rodriguez, 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7252.747s">So</a> I have here the petition from change.org with over 1100 signatures opposed to the Salem Street corridor zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7266.51s">We're</a> not asking for no zoning changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7268.51s">We're</a> asking for the studies to be conducted and the zoning to be written based on that data. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7273.031s">This</a> isn't about opinions. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7274.271s">It</a> isn't about how many people raise their hands and say, yay. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7276.992s">This</a> isn't just about creating housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7279.572s">There</a> is a large scale increase in zoning concentrated into an area that is already dense and lacking in transit access. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7287.454s">Our</a> quality of life, existing conditions and results of the necessary studies are what should largely shape this zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7295.055s">The</a> only argument for packing it all in here is that it's already dense. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7298.916s">So</a> who cares? <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7300.117s">If</a> the density was spread more equitably, then our less dense neighbors with larger lots would be able to relieve us of some of the burden to focus so much density here. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7310.556s">Residents</a> have been saying that reducing lot size from 10k to 3k makes the planned zoning impossible and at the March 5th CDB meeting Emily Ennis from Innes Associates admitted that there are several infeasibilities in the current zoning proposal which are not resolved before passing it back to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7329.21s">So</a> one of the reasons she gave for the failure was the small lots that made it impossible to add parking and hope to change the parking minimums after the zoning has passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7338.581s">Those</a> small lots though also make the buildings too small to require affordable units. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7344.148s">So</a> there's no affordable housing coming here. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7351.178s">Parking</a> is already difficult here, and a second reduction in the parking minimums will have a profound impact on our quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7357.507s">That</a> 0.8 spaces isn't sounding so far-fetched now, is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7361.685s">The</a> studies required and outlined in the comprehensive plan, which I urge you to go back and conduct, and not pass impossible zoning, only to later take out parking minimums to try to squeeze it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7373.712s">These</a> studies should include projected development volume, traffic analysis, shadow studies, environmental impact estimates, and the other studies deemed appropriate to the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7384.377s">The</a> full picture should be clear before a neighborhood is targeted, or as you like to say, up-zoned moderately. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7391.381s">Despite</a> the call for more density near transit, you will note that we aren't near transit. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7396.43s">The</a> most frequent bus that runs down Salem Street is the out-of-service bus on the way to the bus yard. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7402.577s">Please</a> recognize that we are a neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7405.458s">We</a> deserve to have quality of life and so do the people you claim to want to build housing for.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7411.702s">No</a> one dreams of living in an apartment building with little to no green space because 80% lot coverage is allowed and the green score can be waved away with 12 foot sidewalks that'll exacerbate the heat islands that are already here and to have to play where, where can I park every time they drive their car. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7430.051s">Impacts</a> are important to identify and that work, among others, has not been done here. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7435.254s">Conduct</a> the studies and use them to inform the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7438.456s">Don't</a> pass impossible zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7440.658s">Oh,</a> and give the Glenwood neighborhood a call when you decide to zone transit proximate High Street at the same level that we're getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7449.643s">But</a> alas, that's not in your zoning plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7452.305s">One</a> wonders why. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7453.566s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-06-26_TdrPH5HfJeg/2025-06-26_TdrPH5HfJeg.html">Community Development Board 03-05-25</a></h2>

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=106.397s">The</a> vision for Salem Street seems to be to transform the area into a corridor that will be filled with dense, tall apartment buildings.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=145.676s">Anything</a> about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=147.798s">Unfortunately</a> for us, even though the comprehensive plan calls for clear studies about traffic, parking, infrastructure, none of those studies have happened, and we're being informed by an urgency for developers who are waiting to pull permits and build on that corridor and want to build the most that they can.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=200.962s">Well,</a> the incentive that the city is offering is that they're reducing the lot size to build an apartment building by 70%. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=207.804s">So</a> for what half of the land required for a single or two-family home will now be able to hold up to a six-story apartment building without the need for any variances, setbacks, and they're going to require or hope that the developer will allow them to build a 12-foot sidewalk using a piece of their land.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=267.593s">Unfortunately,</a> the community has not been given the benefit of any community meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=272.475s">In</a> fact, the meetings that the planning committee is having usually have the agenda item of update from Innes Associates. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=279.657s">And</a> the meetings themselves seem to be driven by the director of our planning department, Alicia Hunt, who is intent on making sure that the developers don't go ahead and build something that they may find too small.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=300.473s">They've</a> decided 35 feet is not enough height for Salem Street and the surrounding side streets.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=352.357s">Well,</a> in 2022, a developer did a traffic study there, and they found around 18,000 cars go down Salem Street a day, close to 2,000 on Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=361.923s">And</a> they're going to build 0.8 parking spaces per unit as an incentive to bring in developers <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=368.707s">without</a> having conducted a parking or a traffic study in that area at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=374.151s">They're</a> going to leave it up to the individual buildings.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=399.721s">I</a> mean, where are people going to park? <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=402.242s">Well,</a> interestingly enough, if you bring up the graphic for the Salem Street neighborhood known that just focuses on the Salem and Park intersection, you'll see that right in that area, they are primed to add probably 350 plus apartments. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=417.63s">So</a> the Medford average is two cars per unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=423.753s">and</a> they're planning 0.8. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=425.454s">So</a> conservatively, we're talking about 350 new cars coming onto that small area with restricted parking already.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=446.074s">Well,</a> the most frequent bus you'll see on Salem Street is the non-in-service because they're on their way back to the T-Garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=452.137s">But</a> we do have one bus that will be changing its route. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=455.799s">And</a> the MBTA has already informed the city that that bus will not run on time unless a bus lane is added. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=462.003s">But</a> physically, the street is not wide enough to hold a bus lane and two-way traffic.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=492.499s">Well,</a> the MBTA is doing a consolidation plan, so they're trying to shift some of the bus routes. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=497.48s">So</a> now instead of the bus going from Malden Center to Sullivan Station, when the new change comes in, it'll go from Revere <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=505.702s">to</a> Union Square, so it's going to pass by Tufts, which is going to harm a lot of people who currently work at Assembly Row and will no longer have access to that area from Salem Street.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=524.148s">Going</a> away, the same thing that happened to the commuter bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=527.479s">we're</a> no longer going to have access to those transportation options, but we're going to have less parking too.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=577.038s">Well,</a> they feel that it's a positive that they're giving us dense housing with limited parking to discourage people from owning vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=586.004s">Unfortunately,</a> the transportation options available for this area are so limited that I think people who now live there without cars are probably going to find themselves needing a car. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=597.584s">And</a> the incentives that they're asking for to increase height on a building, a fountain, a park bench, are not actually incentives for the community and are just an excuse to allow them to build higher buildings.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=626.323s">Well,</a> currently, buildings are allowed to go up to 35 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=630.184s">And</a> with this new zoning, the minimum will now be 40, can be 42 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=635.326s">We</a> can go up to <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=638.293s">54</a> feet or even as high as 78 feet without needing any kind of variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=642.82s">This</a> is all going to be site plan review. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=645.243s">So</a> they just go in and they say what they want and hopefully for them, they just get granted it without any community notification needed.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=667.625s">Unfortunately</a> for two residents that live next to the vacant hole at 290 Salem Street, those single family homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=674.809s">The</a> only buffer that they require for those small homes is a 5-foot landscaped buffer and an 8-foot tall fence, and there are no further setbacks on the sides or the rear required for these buildings, which can now occupy 80 percent of the lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=692.797s">From</a> 40 to 50 percent, they're now allowed 80 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=696.688s">This</a> is a huge change for people living in that area.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=781.106s">Well,</a> they're calling these mixed-use districts, so they're wanting there to be first floor commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=786.909s">But</a> when you read the zoning, you find that you don't actually have to provide any commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=792.132s">You</a> can, by right, just build a straight-up apartment building with zero economic development. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=799.122s">at</a> all in the whole building.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=816.896s">And</a> even to call it mixed use, if you put in a lobby that's just for the residents of the building, they're calling that mixed use.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=860.338s">Well,</a> unfortunately, uh, the planning committee has decided that rezoning urgently for developers is more important than heat islands, so, which is why they're requiring 12-foot sidewalks and 80% lot coverage in an area that already suffers from heat islands. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=879.163s">They're</a> also not pausing to make any kind of affordability plan for this corridor because the need for any housing is more urgent than <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=889.781s">the</a> need to take the time to plan to make sure we gain affordable housing on these already extremely small lots that will not naturally produce affordable housing.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=990.588s">Well,</a> even just the name of this zoning, the Salem Street Corridor District, it takes away the fact that there are neighborhoods here. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=998.995s">These</a> are very dense neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1000.857s">This</a> is an environmental justice neighborhood with a large amount of people who are not <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1005.921s">citizens,</a> their residents who may not speak English, a lot of lower income people live here, people who don't have time to scour the city website to look and see what is actually happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1019.01s">And</a> the bulk of this happened during the month of December, which is a very busy month for most people, and people are not listening to four-hour <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1028.216s">planning</a> committee meetings to see if the street near their home is being mentioned and being changed in such a dramatic way because there's a fundamental belief that if they're going to do something this dramatic to my neighborhood, surely they will notify us. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1045.34s">They'll</a> let us know. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1046.22s">They'll</a> come out to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1047.72s">They'll</a> meet with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1049.02s">They'll</a> take in our input and then inform the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1052.141s">But</a> unfortunately, that's not what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1055.202s">So</a> none of that took place? <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1057.903s">No,</a> the meetings happened with one to two people in the room and they just kept moving forward and saying that they had all the community input they needed in 2022 and they were working on the comprehensive plan.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1084.951s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1085.431s">Interestingly</a> enough, the input from 2022 on Salem Street was, the traffic is terrible here. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1091.874s">This</a> street is a nightmare. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1093.815s">Alicia</a> Hunt herself said, even when I had children in the Roberts, I refused to drive on Salem Street because Salem Street is terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1104.667s">So</a> I don't know where they got, you know, that'd be a great place to put a couple thousand apartments.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1146.046s">From</a> a brief conversation I had with the fire department, they do not have the equipment nor the manpower to handle a corridor full of 42 to 78 foot skinny, no space between apartment buildings.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1167.291s">I</a> did speak to a member of the fire department and they said they didn't know why they were not brought into this conversation.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1239.906s">I</a> feel like I've definitely been thrust into the role of the town crier, like, look over here, this something big is happening and, and you're gonna miss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1248.632s">And</a> it feels like I'm coming against a city council that seems to be run by activists. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1253.695s">They're</a> using the mindset of we need housing now with <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1257.337s">without</a> hesitation, without pause for study. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1260.979s">And</a> that's not what our government should be writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1263.261s">Our</a> government should be saying, we do in fact need housing, but we need to do studies and inform the housing that we build so that we don't overwhelm an area or create the wrong type of housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1275.048s">Does</a> Medford need this much more luxury housing? <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1279.231s">If</a> every one of those buildings only has nine units in it, that will be a net of zero affordable units. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1286.936s">Will</a> that benefit a community where we have thousands of families that need an affordable unit and we're only creating luxury units?
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1322.293s">Well,</a> if you do research on these units, you'll find that about 25% of these units have one or more schoolchildren. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1329.558s">This</a> is not something that was presented by the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1332.499s">This</a> is something that if you do research into the type of housing that's being built and the fact that there aren't homes for all of these families to live in, so they're living in apartments. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1345.207s">which</a> is not the same as has always been and the schools that they're planning to feed these children into are already very full. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1354.272s">They're</a> high five hundreds and they're only made for 600 children.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1459.326s">Unfortunately</a> for us, this plan is on the urgent track and moving very quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1464.65s">There</a> are two meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1465.85s">They've</a> already advertised the final meeting when they plan to vote this through, so there's a meeting on February 5th, which is the continuation of the Community Development Board meeting, and that is being held on Zoom only. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1479.64s">The</a> final vote is set to be taken on February 11th at the City Council meeting at 7 o'clock at City Hall, and <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1487.905s">people</a> need to speak up. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1489.466s">They</a> need to start emailing Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1491.387s">They</a> need to email the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1492.807s">They</a> need to email the Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1495.509s">And</a> they need to tell them to pause and appropriately study this zoning before they push it through. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1502.772s">The</a> consequences for the neighborhood if they don't could be significant.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1531.015s">And</a> I can guarantee you there are permits ready to be submitted as soon as that zoning is live. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1535.196s">We</a> have an open pit at 290 Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1537.997s">In</a> the Park Street graphic, there are five parcels that are owned by one developer. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1543.998s">So</a> that's six parcels that could be ready to go by spring.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1583.051s">There</a> is a rush to add housing, but we're not doing it strategically. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1586.992s">If</a> we go back to the comprehensive plan, there are specific studies that are called for. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1592.073s">There's</a> guidelines and things that you're supposed to do to try to prevent displacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1596.394s">This</a> is an environmental justice neighborhood, and it's not the only neighborhood they're planning to go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1601.675s">They're</a> planning to go to Boston Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1603.156s">They're</a> planning to go to Main Street, which are also environmental justice areas, and push more density on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1609.357s">Why</a> are only the environmental justice neighborhoods <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1613.779s">that</a> are already very dense being targeted for such increased density while other neighborhoods are preserved at low density, untouched.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1632.006s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1633.246s">Boston</a> Ave and Main Street have already been identified as corridors by the planning committee.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1641.128s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1641.969s">That's</a> all I can say to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1643.529s">Anyone</a> that's been down Boston Ave knows it's a parking lot most of the time.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1718.465s">We</a> know there's six members that are in favor, and they're ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1721.586s">They</a> want their housing on Sale Street, and they want to move on to the next street.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1781.258s">It's</a> doing something. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1782.279s">Unfortunately,</a> what it's doing is rapidly gentrifying the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1787.582s">It's</a> going to price people out. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1789.183s">People</a> are not going to be able to live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1792.325s">People</a> are not going to be able to get to work because the bus is changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1794.886s">People</a> are going to need places to park. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1797.468s">You're</a> going to be touring the area looking for a parking space when you get home from work. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1802.17s">It's</a> going to be <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1803.831s">a</a> mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1804.252s">And</a> this is not a it could happen, this is we have developers who are ready to build, according to Alicia Hunt, they are ready to pull permits, and if they don't urgently pass this zoning, then the buildings may be smaller than the planning committee and the planning department would like. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1821.855s">So</a> there's no regard for current residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1824.337s">There's</a> little regard for future residents as they're not planning any huge infrastructure or parking upgrades for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1831.784s">There's</a> just an assumption that people won't have children and won't have cars, which is not a realistic assumption to base zoning an entire area on. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1843.615s">We</a> need studies. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1845.436s">We</a> need them now, before this is passed.<h2><a href="../2025-02-11_szFUz6VjxpM/2025-02-11_szFUz6VjxpM.html">City Council 02-11-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5329.247s">Hi,</a> my name is Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5330.908s">I</a> live at 281 Park Street, and I have a different impression of the meeting last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5336.831s">As</a> with all of the meetings that have been held about the Salem Street Corridor, they're very vague PowerPoint presentations that don't inform about the zoning in any way. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5346.56s">What</a> happened last night was that neighbors had educated neighbors, neighbors had notified other neighbors that a meeting was happening and neighbors came in with the knowledge of the zoning and their questions were about the zoning and they were asking the consultant these questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5364.153s">I</a> don't feel that you have done enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5365.994s">If</a> you do a public hearing and you're rezoning an entire neighborhood and you're in a room alone and every single person in that room is getting paid, then the neighborhood did not know. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5376.459s">This</a> was not done correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5378.96s">It</a> should be gone back and gone over the right way with proper processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5384.583s">And</a> having a Q&A last night and basically <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5387.727s">not</a> going to take that on board what the neighbors have told you is insincere. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5394.03s">People</a> were there and they were knowledgeable about the subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5398.333s">And</a> that is not the result of Innis. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5400.674s">That</a> is not the result of any of these public meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5403.455s">That</a> is the result of them going into the zoning <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5407.013s">and</a> learning it from each other and for themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5410.634s">And</a> I think that needs to be acknowledged and it shouldn't have to happen that neighbors citywide have to teach each other the zoning in order to know what is coming to their neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5421.918s">These</a> PowerPoints that just show blocks stacked on top of each other that say how high buildings are or show what the neighborhood looks like that we've already seen is not education on what is in your zoning proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5437.259s">Please</a> consider that we live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5439.84s">We</a> will have to live with these ramifications. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5443.041s">We</a> will have to live with the streets being less safe, with the traffic being heavier. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5449.163s">We</a> are a neighborhood and we should matter too. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5453.525s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3789.466s">Well,</a> just for clarity, are we going to allow pot shops on Salem Street since it's now a corridor?
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3857.17s">I'd</a> love confirmation.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3965.024s">Cheryl</a> Rodriguez, 281 Park Street, ground zero for this outrageous proposal. I know everyone was looking for a simplification. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3972.946s">Simplification</a> is 3,000 square foot lot would allow a minimum of six units of housing, which is an attack on my neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3980.708s">Currently,</a> you need 5,000 square feet to build a single, and this would be <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3986.533s">The</a> equivalent of 12 for where you could normally build a single and an area with severely restricted parking and a very narrow, very busy street. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3996.584s">If</a> you've asked anyone in any of these neighborhoods, and this is not limited to Salem Street, this is going fingering down all the side streets in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4006.795s">all</a> this dense housing, not one single person living in that area, and there's someone here who doesn't live in that area, and we'll tell you it's great, has said we'd love more traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4016.579s">We'd</a> love six units of housing on a three foot square lot, and oh, please don't make them build parking because we have so much extra parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4025.262s">We</a> don't have any parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4027.123s">Salem</a> Street is not a bustling commercial corridor. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4029.984s">It's</a> a mix of convenience stores, smoke shops, pizza places, and lots of already dense housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4037.423s">It's</a> an always busy cut through street made more narrow recently despite the high volume of trucks and out of service buses that pass through all day. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4047.711s">The</a> parking is so scarce that the traffic department didn't remove one single spot when adding in their dangerous bike lane that cars and trucks drive through all day as the lane on the other side is too small to accommodate large vehicles safely. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4065.362s">Many</a> side streets, including Park Street, Parris Street, Court Street, have areas where there is no parking allowed on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4074.625s">The</a> streets are too narrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4076.106s">You</a> can't fit cars there. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4079.127s">The</a> lots are small, and these joining changes would destroy the area and add so many cars with nowhere to park them and so many people. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4088.735s">These</a> tall buildings with little to no parking will destroy the quality of life for the area between shadow and lack of parking and increases to already heavy traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4099.948s">A</a> single bus comes down this road once or twice an hour at the busy times. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4106.96s">Perhaps</a> you're unfamiliar with Salem Street, but if you go out the parking lot, take a right, go to the second exit around the Rotary, you'll see us. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4115.243s">We're</a> there. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4116.103s">We're</a> paying taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4117.663s">We're</a> a very dense and busy area. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4120.244s">What</a> you won't see there is a bustling commercial corridor. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4124.746s">Our</a> quality of life can't constantly be on the table in order to only increase density in the areas that are already too dense, the areas that you're dismissing. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4136.553s">If</a> you need density, perhaps it's time to look west. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4140.994s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-12-02_53d9Rk8X1OU/2024-12-02_53d9Rk8X1OU.html">12.2.2024 - Regular MSC Meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11193.133s">I'd</a> just like to follow up, if she's done, about the question on the difference in the students and the cost per student per year.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11204.099s">Councilor</a> Callahan mentioned that the students' differences are calculated based on different amounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11210.121s">But</a> when I looked at the data, Medford appeared in the top third for the entire state. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11214.282s">The</a> schools that were below it were approximately $6,000 to $8,000 less per student. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11220.104s">Even</a> if we factored in the tech spend of $500,000 that the councilor mentioned, that only averages out to about $1,000 per student. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11229.227s">So</a> I haven't seen any evidence that Medford is spending significantly less than other schools, that we're not spending enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11235.773s">I</a> know no one answered about the whole increase in the ELL students, but these are factors that are actually impacting our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11243.04s">And</a> if the council, we're not going to catch up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11245.323s">There's</a> another 15 ELL students waiting to join those schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11248.566s">And</a> if we don't get more money from the state, this override is going to be nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11252.119s">It's</a> good.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11262.597s">No,</a> I literally said they are very expensive.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11285.494s">The</a> state should be helping pay for those students.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11288.176s">That's</a> not what we do.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11300.781s">But</a> council shouldn't be attacking residents.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11318.547s">So</a> I hope that this council will advocate for more state money.

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6427.782s">Charles</a> Rodriguez, 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6430.183s">I</a> just wanted to mention the withdrawal letter from Habit. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6433.005s">I</a> mentioned adversity as the reason for the withdrawal, which makes an ordinance for methadone even more important than ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6439.889s">Under</a> our current zoning, this can open with minimal notification and no wide community notice anywhere with a simple permit for a medical facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6449.395s">An</a> opioid dispensary can just open with virtually no one knowing until it's too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6453.597s">Only</a> 10 people were notified, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6455.759s">that</a> a medical facility was gonna open at 360 Salem Street, and it's actually a methadone dispensary. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6462.789s">While</a> they've pulled the application, they can submit it and be on the agenda for the July meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6467.576s">So</a> this isn't over, we need an ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6473.837s">Medford</a> needs a specific use on the use table for this methadone dispensary. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6477.502s">The</a> obvious limitations already exist in our pot ordinance, only in commercial two or industrial one zone, nowhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6485.212s">If</a> we won't allow pot in our neighborhoods, then why would we allow opioid dispensaries? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6490.37s">You</a> must move to change the zoning now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6492.351s">Otherwise,</a> a for-profit company will look for the cheapest real estate, even in the middle of a residential area where it doesn't belong, and just seek to open with minimal notice as a medical facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6504.057s">They</a> need not provide any medical attention or treatment, merely a pill dispensed from a for-profit vendor whose purpose is to file as many claims for as many doses as they can to make a larger profit without regard for the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6520.219s">Habit</a> opened in Springfield on a street with two treatment centers in existence with no issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6525.383s">Suddenly</a> there was open drug use, prostitution, drug dealers, and other crime that was described as an open air drug market. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6532.47s">The</a> police chief increased patrols in the area and drove crime into the neighboring streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6538.12s">which</a> here would all be residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6541.381s">Efforts</a> by the city to reach Habit were ignored, and then the press moved on and left the neighbors to deal with the pain. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6548.283s">Habit</a> has an opioid dispensary at Mass and Cass, and it too is an open air drug market. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6552.905s">The</a> Globe and the Herald recently reported that the police attempting to stop the open drug use found that it just moved over a few blocks. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6560.527s">and</a> then moved back when they tried to disperse them from the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6564.13s">What</a> impact will this have on any recovering addicts who live in our neighborhood and now have to be exposed to open drug use where they live? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6572.036s">And</a> what impact on others living in the area or the dancing school or the nearby restaurant or the elementary school that has nearly 600 children? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6581.043s">The</a> neighborhood has been fighting to be heard and is the only reason that we even know this project was on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6588.148s">10</a> people were notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6589.63s">Multiple</a> people have printed and delivered flyers, they have picketed, they have collected signatures. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6594.775s">Under</a> the current application, as only a medical facility, the city is not required to provide a community meeting as they would with a pot dispensary. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6603.263s">This</a> business that will harm entire neighborhoods and the current zoning allows them to only notify 10 people? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6610.328s">This</a> is a mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6611.689s">This</a> is missing zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6613.37s">This</a> should only be allowed in commercial 2 and industrial 1, just as a pot dispensary is limited. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6619.815s">A</a> community meeting should also have been required. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6622.698s">Regular</a> oversight should occur in order to keep that permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6626.622s">It</a> should not be an easy process as it could potentially destroy a neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6630.786s">No</a> neighborhood should have to roll the dice and hope HABIT won't operate as they normally do to the extreme detriment of those around them. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6637.893s">We</a> need to be aware that this application will return. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6640.396s">They</a> have already said they're coming to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6642.959s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-06-12_h9rFEwBYeQg/2024-06-12_h9rFEwBYeQg.html">City Council 06-11-24</a></h2>

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9792.432s">Hi,</a> Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9797.433s">So,</a> I'm listening to the demo delay seems to be a little bit misunderstood here. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9803.254s">The</a> delay is at most 18 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9806.581s">Flipper</a> that already spoke bought a house that was falling down. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9809.723s">His</a> delay would not last anywhere near 18 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9813.044s">He</a> would be released and allowed to demo and build. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9816.486s">This</a> is about bigger projects and projects that are slipping under the radar. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9820.328s">And</a> I have spoken to Paul Mochi about 277 Park Street, probably five, six times, because this is a Flipper in our community who knows where all the loopholes are. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9831.173s">And</a> I hear when I go to the building office that he's a nice guy and he's not a nice guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9836.414s">He</a> will get a permit for an interior non-structural demo so that he won't trigger any oversight. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9842.797s">And</a> then he'll tear off the siding. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9844.578s">He'll</a> sledgehammer the porches into the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9847.7s">And</a> if no one calls, he continues to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9851.322s">So</a> the person that lives next door or on the street has to keep calling every time he does something unsafe or outside his permit to get someone to come down and check on him. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9861.787s">So</a> maybe you need more inspectors, or maybe you need someone else to look at these plans before these projects are approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9869.313s">He</a> demoed a porch, which he wasn't allowed to demo. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9872.095s">They</a> called it an accident. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9873.957s">He</a> was supposed to restore the porch. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9875.998s">Instead,</a> he built a new room. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9877.82s">Another</a> violation of his plans, a violation of the historic commission rules, <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9883.184s">And</a> the penalty was he was shut down for 24 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9885.626s">And</a> I believe he got $1,000 fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9888.429s">So</a> they know what they can get away with. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9890.571s">And</a> they carry on. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9892.473s">And</a> what they're doing is they're taking moderate price housing, the house next door works to 1000 square foot apartments. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9901.881s">The</a> house costs $600,000 was livable had to working class families living in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9909.288s">He</a> is now flipping it into two 2,500 square foot homes that he'll sell for $800,000 to $900,000 each. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9918.833s">So</a> this is gentrification. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9920.474s">This</a> is not talking about end users. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9923.836s">These</a> are not residents buying homes and trying to change windows, porches, or decks. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9930.879s">This</a> is really a last ditch effort of people saying, help us. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9935.281s">City</a> Council, can you work on the zoning? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9938.002s">Can</a> you stop the gentrification? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9940.463s">You're</a> pushing people out, the people in this community that we say we care about, the low income, <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9947.588s">The</a> minority demographic are being pushed out of our neighborhoods and we're not doing anything to stop it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9954.951s">Somerville</a> stopped us from being able to buy and moderately priced to family and converted into condos because it was pushing out residents.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9999.545s">Absolutely,</a> and a lot of the practices that we do in Medford are just reactionary because we refuse to act before it gets too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=10006.67s">And</a> the Nelson Properties owns at least a dozen homes in this community and is replicating these activities across the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=10014.315s">There's</a> also one on Court Street on a parcel that's probably two thirds the size of the house next door to me going up, but the new house is the same size. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=10024.362s">I'm</a> really concerned that the lot coverage rules are not being adhered to. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=10029.307s">And</a> this is something that you need to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=10032.048s">But</a> yes, Somerville did stop condoization. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=10035.268s">Articles</a> are being written that say, come to Medford, buy the two families. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=10040.13s">They</a> will not stop you from condoizing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=10042.51s">You</a> can easily gentrify and make lots of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=10045.171s">And</a> that's why people are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=10047.351s">If</a> we care about housing, we want end users and not just <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=10051.528s">high</a> wage end users, the man next door told me these would be quality people because these units would be very expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=10058.972s">And</a> I would say that that is disgusting. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=10062.194s">And</a> that's not what we should want. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=10063.995s">Only</a> people that make high wages are not the only high quality people. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=10068.838s">So</a> help us. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=10070.458s">Please</a> do something on zoning before it's too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=10073.04s">Thank</a> you to the historic commission for trying.

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3185.348s">Hi,</a> Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3188.589s">I</a> apologize for my absence last week, but I was diagnosed with the flu and I decided to keep it all away from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3193.812s">So</a> you're welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3197.343s">Yep,</a> I went through the Tamiflu, I am not contagious. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3201.353s">And</a> I brought. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3203.79s">hand</a> sanitizer, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3206.432s">I</a> just wanted to come up and speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3208.154s">I</a> live next door to the notorious 277 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3213.198s">That</a> home was purchased by a flipper, and work commenced on Memorial Day weekend, and I've learned a lot about zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3220.324s">I</a> thought I knew a lot about zoning, but now I know even more. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3223.726s">So</a> you won't realize how many loopholes there are in our zoning laws until you have someone break ground on construction next door to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3234.395s">On</a> that Memorial Day weekend, a dumpster was delivered at 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3237.616s">and</a> the first sound we heard was a window being tossed out a hole on a second floor and then the entire contents, walls of that house, floors, everything flung from the second floor window. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3250.261s">You</a> can just imagine what a dust cloud that is to have that happen for two, three, four months every day because there are no procedures in Medford that require them to mitigate the dust. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3262.385s">So</a> once they pull the window out, they can just fling things willy-nilly out the window and cover your home in a cloud. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3269.33s">So</a> your heating and air conditioning filters will be clogged with the construction debris. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3276.696s">If</a> you have a swimming pool in the backyard, <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3279.698s">You</a> won't be able to swim in it because you'll never be able to get it clean because there'll be constant debris coming into the pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3286.484s">There</a> are no requirements to notify you that they're going to be flinging debris out the window for months on end. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3294.33s">So</a> you cannot protect your property, you can't protect your vehicle. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3298.713s">Nails</a> will fly into your driveway, you'll get flat tires. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3305.11s">And</a> this goes on because this is entirely allowed in our zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3309.492s">There's</a> no regulation requiring them to mitigate the items that are coming into your yard. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3316.935s">So</a> then one day they'll come with a big truck and they'll drop off an excavator because they're going to dig out a foundation behind the house and they'll back the excavator into your fence, knock down the fence, leave your yard entirely exposed, and there's no regulation to require them to <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3335.117s">fix</a> that fence or put it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3336.858s">So</a> now your dog is running out into this hole in the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3340.9s">There's</a> nearly 600 children going to school on your street and they're going, they can go into the hole because it's not required to be fenced off to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3350.265s">I</a> know zoning isn't of much interest to Councilor Knight, so he stepped out. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3357.305s">Something</a> else that I found as I tried to go and see the plans for this project that are required to be available for the public to view is that I was told for three months that the plans were out being scanned. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3370.01s">So</a> there were no copies for me to view to find out what was going to be happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3374.512s">Next</a> door, they said all they knew was there was some kind of a renovation going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3379.474s">When</a> it started, they had a permit to do interior demo. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3385.357s">I</a> called the building department when two men with sledgehammers were slamming into the porches on the front of the house until the porches fell into the middle of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3395.36s">They</a> had an interior non-structural demo permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3399.861s">Someone</a> came down around three o'clock, made them stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3402.982s">By</a> 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3404.083s">the</a> next morning, the stop work order was gone and work commenced. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3408.684s">But</a> there were no plans, so there's no way to find out what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3411.905s">You</a> have 20 days to contest the plans, but there were no plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3416.525s">I</a> recently saw the plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3417.587s">I</a> saw the plans two weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3419.089s">It</a> took that long to see the plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3420.851s">Even</a> after they said they were done being scanned, they were often unavailable because they were with an inspector. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3428.06s">Then</a> I wasn't allowed to see them unless an inspector was present. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3432.831s">When</a> I finally did see them, it was with the building commissioner, Paul Moki, and I pointed out that the two plans they had, the initial site plan and the current site plan, showed that there's a two-family house on the front of the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3448.397s">The</a> new site plan showed perhaps a difference of about 10 feet to scale and included a two-family home converted to a single, a two-car garage with two floors of housing above it, and another home in the back. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3463.755s">So</a> a 160-foot lot has a 105-foot, 34-foot, 9-inch building on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3474.003s">And</a> their paperwork says their lot coverage is 20%. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3476.705s">If</a> you look at the dimensional requirements on our zoning, you're not allowed to build without a variance if you exceed 35%. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3486.112s">But</a> mathematically, it's impossible that this home is only at 20% because 160 feet <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3494.741s">105</a> feet of that is now house, and it's 30 to 35 feet wide with two driveways. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3503.427s">They</a> were able to add a second driveway without needing to get any approvals from the neighborhood, and they'll be removing two on-street parking spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3511.917s">So</a> I was very concerned, and I spoke directly to Paul Moki and asked him why they were allowed to exceed lot coverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3518.442s">I</a> still haven't gotten updated information on the lot coverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3521.824s">He</a> went out last Friday before the President's Day weekend and ordered them to stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3526.207s">He</a> took two measurements. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3528.649s">The</a> measurement that they had from the back of their new property was 67 feet, 7 and 3 quarter inches. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3536.135s">The</a> actual measurement at the job site was 55 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3541.253s">He</a> said, so that was a difference of over 12 and a half feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3545.019s">The</a> work stopped for a week and then it just started back up again. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3549.187s">So</a> some easy things that you can do to help us would be <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3555.994s">If</a> someone's going to build a house that's two to three times the size of what's already on the property, maybe a site plan review. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3563.4s">Someone</a> else could have looked at that math and said, there's no way this is 20%. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3568.183s">So</a> this permit should not have been issued. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3571.465s">They</a> should have had to go to the ZBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3573.107s">So</a> that's something that's already in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3575.068s">If</a> you could add, you know, so I'm thinking of things you could do quickly to try to improve quality of life, fencing at work zones. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3582.707s">If</a> a person or an animal had fallen into that pit, that would be tragic and could easily be avoided. <a

href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3595.538s">When</a> we call and ask about the timeline, they tell us they can take as long as they want, that they can start work at 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3601.122s">every</a> single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3602.347s">work</a> for one to two hours, stop and not come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3605.27s">And</a> if you do complain about one of this gentleman's projects, he will assign someone to just hammer all day long. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3614.14s">They</a> never need to get another board. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3616.022s">They</a> never need to get more nails because their job is just to bang and make noise to punish you for reporting them. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3624.135s">If</a> we could have a requirement to maybe mitigate the dust or the debris, I do live there. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3628.479s">It's</a> not a construction zone for my family. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3631.602s">We've</a> been enduring this since May and this home is not near completion. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3637.228s">It</a> will probably go through this next summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3641.091s">Projects</a> of this length of time, it would be nice if maybe Christmas Eve or the day after Thanksgiving, they don't have to start at 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3649.718s">There</a> could be a limit to how many days they could disrupt the neighborhood in a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3655.903s">If</a> we're waiting for plans to be scanned, why can I not see the scan now? <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3663.63s">Where</a> did they scan it to? <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3666.86s">So</a> why can't I see it unless the physical plans are there? <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3670.442s">I've</a> permanently lost sunlight on the side of my yard, and I've lost the privacy in my yard, and there was no site plan review for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3679.007s">Even</a> though the site plan shows that my yard is still private, the physical building is in my backyard, overlooks my pool, and I no longer have sunlight on that side of my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3689.854s">I</a> had no rights to stop that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3691.315s">I</a> had no rights to view the plans because of the way that the ordinances are written. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3698.534s">So</a> I've had many conversations with the building inspectors and then they'd scream that and told me that this is a nice guy and he does projects all over the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3707.199s">I've</a> heard from other people all over the city that the projects that they have are exceeding 35% lot coverage there. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3713.983s">So</a> why is our building department issuing permits that are exceeding our zoning allowances and not making them go to the ZBA? <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3721.588s">It's</a> one thing for them to go to the ZBA <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3724.75s">and</a> be granted a variance, even if you disagree with it, you have the chance to be heard and say this project is larger than it's allowed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3732.914s">But</a> it's another thing for the projects to just be approved in the building department because they're skipping the variance process. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3741.484s">So</a> the most important thing about this is we're not making these sacrifices for affordable units. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3747.392s">These</a> are not affordable housing units. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3749.655s">This</a> was a two family modest size home that housed two blue collar families. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3756.412s">This</a> house was gutted and an additional house was built right in and the flippers promised me that these will be very expensive units and the quality of the neighbors will be extremely high, meaning that they'll be unaffordable for most people. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3769.543s">They're</a> gonna drive up my valuation of my home, but not the actual value of my home. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3776.233s">So</a> when you get your zoning consultant, you may want to consider that they actually, in Texas, they had a bunch of flippers that were going in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3784.116s">They</a> have a show, the Joe and Chip Gaines. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3787.837s">And</a> what they did was they were increasing the values of the homes so much and pricing the families out of their homes that they created a separate tax rate for those homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3798.241s">Because</a> those homes were, you'd have a $900,000 house next to a house that was only worth $400,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3803.683s">And</a> to increase the property value assessment on that home next door without actual being value added to that home was pricing those people out. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3814.707s">So</a> they created a separate structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3816.708s">So</a> that could be possibly a tiered option that you could look into that would, if these homes are that much greater in value, that they would bear the burden. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3827.972s">So</a> I'm hoping that there's some way that someone can look into this because I'm hitting the wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3833.855s">And</a> I'm just a resident that happens to know a lot about zoning, but this is happening to a lot of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3840.858s">And</a> the frustration of hitting the wall and seeing that your entire lifestyle is being changed beside you because someone is just <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3848.482s">building</a> a building that's blotting out the sun. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3850.603s">This</a> building is nearly as tall as the apartment buildings being built on Salem Street in a residential neighborhood next to my small single family home. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3859.206s">And</a> there was absolutely nothing I could do to stop it.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3874.668s">The</a> response that I received from him was he called later that day, he called about 12.45 on the Friday of President's Day weekend and said, I've ordered them to stop working and they won't be working again until this is resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3888.427s">As</a> I was on the phone with him, he could hear them hammering in the background, and he came out and had someone, Dennis, come out and issue a fine, but I haven't heard back since then.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3971.182s">They</a> didn't do that for us.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4041.705s">And</a> one other thing that I noticed is that they can close off your entire street and dig a trench in front of your driveway so that you can't leave your driveway, and there's no city requirement to notify you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4054.816s">So</a> they did that for four days. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4057.399s">Someone</a> came out to go to work, there was a hole in front of their driveway, and they were screaming and hollering that they couldn't go to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4064.606s">They</a> had to get a police detail, that was required by law, but notifying us that we'd be unable to access our driveways for four days. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4072.854s">Was</a> not required. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4074.575s">Also,</a> what wasn't required is they left their equipment on the street in front of a gentleman with a wheelchair's home so that he couldn't get picked up and dropped off in front of his home. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4083.657s">That</a> was left there for the weekend as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4086.618s">So</a> these are just little tiny loopholes that you would think would be common sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4091.2s">But</a> if it saves them a dollar, they're going to avoid doing.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4098.252s">Now,</a> that's not what I was told by the building commissioner's office, so they're either giving me incorrect information, they don't know the proper information, because I went directly to the building commissioner.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4120.268s">When</a> I asked the building commissioner's office when it was going to stop, if I had to have my husband park on another street for the next couple of days, they said they weren't sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4129.838s">I</a> should probably go over and ask.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4143.585s">The</a> fine was issued after they were told to stop work, they ended up having a fine issued because what they did was they knew it was a long holiday weekend, so they packed up and left and came back when they knew City Hall was closed.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4155.888s">And</a> that's the second time they've had a stop work order and violated the stop work order.<h2><a href="../2019-10-23_UR250MtFq2M/2019-10-23_UR250MtFq2M.html">Medford School Committee meeting October 21, 2019</a></h2>
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=747.321s">Hi,</a> I'm Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=751.044s">I</a> just came to, I wanted to speak about the bus two at the middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=755.888s">My</a> daughter is a sixth grader at the McGlynn, and we've had a few issues with that bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=761.433s">One</a> of the issues is the bus is at the Andrews, so the McGlynn students walk over, and last Friday in the wind and the rain, by the time they walked over, the bus was full, and the kids had to sit three and four across. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=773.823s">That</a> seems to be a regular Friday occurrence. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=776.946s">Right</a> now, the bus is slightly full during the week because the cross-country team, which has 40 members right now, they're not riding the bus on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, but I anticipate that that will become an issue at the end of the month when that season ends. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=791.864s">A</a> couple of times she's been denied access to the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=795.267s">One</a> time she was diverted to a different bus and taken on a ride to Winthrop Street to Goldilocks Bagels, at which point she was on the phone with me telling me she didn't know where she was and I could hear about six or seven other children in the background screaming, don't leave us here, we don't know where we are, don't leave us here. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=813.207s">They</a> were returned to the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=815.53s">I</a> called, I didn't know at the time that it was not going to the McGlynn, it was going to the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=820.275s">I</a> called the McGlynn and spoke to the secretary who was going to try to page Mr. Tucci, but by the time they got him, the children had been deposited at the Andrews and told that they were on their own and to walk home. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=833.332s">At</a> that point they walked across Riverside by themselves, across Salem Street by themselves to get home. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=839.636s">There</a> was a handful of kids, luckily one of them was an 8th grader, the rest of them were 6th graders who were shocked in the second week of school to find themselves walking home alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=850.002s">So</a> they've already moved one stop off of this bus to another bus because of overcrowding But it's continuing to be an issue that we've called Several times asked them to to track and monitor, but they don't ask the children to sign up which bus they're going on so It's kind of a guesstimate how many kids will be on the bus? <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=869.63s">But</a> I think when winter comes it's going to be more of an issue a couple of kids said that they're sitting on other kids laps Because they're told they can't stand, but there's nowhere for them to sit <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=878.689s">So</a> it's a real crowding issue.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=891.434s">It's</a> bus number two. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=892.515s">It</a> goes on downtown Street I've reported it to the principal a few times and I was really upset when they the couple of times that they had to walk home So, okay, so I will definitely be able to follow up with the bus company tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=905.667s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=906.167s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=906.408s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=906.748s">I</a> appreciate very much Thank you<h2><a href="../2019-09-11_OQKxfahlemU/2019-09-11_OQKxfahlemU.html">Medford School Committee meeting September 9, 2019</a></h2>
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7225.911s">Hi,</a> I'm Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7231.487s">281</a> Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7232.748s">My</a> family experienced the lottery this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7236.289s">We're</a> parents that were from the Roberts Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7240.571s">We</a> found that the lottery was not evenly split for the Roberts Elementary School because we do have the Yale Welcome Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7247.933s">Although</a> they are members of our community, they are not members who actually had integrated with our students during their time at the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7255.176s">So</a> when they split our students in half, <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7258.258s">What</a> happened was 53 students went to the Andrews, and some were in the neighborhood of the low 20s of the students that they had been in class with daily for six years went to the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7268.822s">The</a> students that went to the McGlynn found themselves to be fairly socially isolated because the majority of their friends did go to the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7276.806s">Anyone</a> who was present for the lottery when they pulled the Roberts' names saw several circles of friends, boys, girls, <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7285.009s">all</a> the students in the circle would cheer except for one, the one student who chose the McGlynn and found that they were being separated from all of their children, all of their friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7295.514s">So</a> I'm hoping that when we think about the lottery this year, that we think about while it's great that some of the equity has changed, and I'm not saying that's bad, perhaps we could have offset each of the elementary schools by five children. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7311.357s">And</a> instead of having the offset at the Roberts be close to 30 children, in that case, my daughter would have had 15 more friends at the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7321.705s">Those</a> students that are also in the low 20s are also split between two sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7326.608s">She</a> had about two friends that she socialized with that were going to the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7330.611s">And</a> one week before school started, one of the friends called her excitedly and said, yes, I got transferred to the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7339.418s">She</a> quickly went down to one friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7341.607s">Her</a> first week was really isolated. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7345.229s">There's</a> not a lot of opportunities to talk to children, and at lunch and recess, as she walked around the track, she said, a lot of the children are with the friends that they've had for years, which I had hoped for my child as I enrolled her in Medford Public Schools at the age of three, so that she would have long-lasting friendships. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7363.787s">So</a> I hope that socio-emotional will factor in this year in the lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7369.013s">I</a> know this was a unique situation for the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7372.697s">And</a> I think that it's vitally important to look at for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7377.763s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2019-03-08_qChIJ_zcV6s/2019-03-08_qChIJ_zcV6s.html">Medford School Committee meeting Wednesday, March 6, 2019</a></h2>

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3421.408s">Yes,</a> the DPW would be making that a better area.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3430.051s">I</a> know they have to cement in the <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3435.102s">The</a> tables, but there's not a plan to cement the whole area. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3438.565s">But</a> they do realize that they'll have to break that up.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3450.517s">There</a> was no indications that they would uninstall it to do this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3456.158s">Does</a> the canopy need to be replaced? <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3458.079s">The</a> canopy's got some significant holes. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3460.72s">The</a> amazing thing about it is if it's had some holes for 10 years and it's still retained this much. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3466.822s">So</a> this is a canvas that pretty much the warranty is about 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3473.004s">But</a> if it's kept well, the DPW thinks it'll last much longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3478.905s">This</a> one... <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3480.626s">Had</a> holes in it a decade ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3482.43s">So</a> it's probably 15 or more years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3485.736s">So</a> it holds up pretty well It's a durable, you know heavy canvas
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3533.901s">I</a> know that this park underwent some updates to make it more ADA compliant. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3540.126s">Actually,</a> behind that area is where the handicap crosswalk is. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3544.649s">They</a> redid some of the pathways, extended them because you couldn't get from Park Street right into the park. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3552.915s">You</a> couldn't cross from Brogan <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3556.146s">to</a> get to the other side for the park. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3557.987s">It</a> was harder to access the baseball field. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3561.749s">So</a> they did do some changes there already. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3564.37s">There</a> is right in front of this is pavement. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3567.292s">So</a> I imagine if they had if they needed to put a short jaunt, that could be something that they would achieve. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3575.036s">They</a> hadn't really thought that far just <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3578.722s">What</a> can we put here to make this usable space? <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3581.145s">Because</a> I wouldn't want to sit under there now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3584.688s">I've</a> seen people put folding tables there and try to jockey them because it's not flat. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3589.233s">But</a> right now, it's pretty much unusable. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3594.418s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2018-09-13_HY2bBQvmkEQ/2018-09-13_HY2bBQvmkEQ.html">Medford School Committee meeting September 6, 2018</a></h2>

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3171.879s">Cheryl</a> Rodriguez, 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3173.879s">I</a> actually have a handout to go with the materials that I'll be discussing. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3182.883s">So</a> I am a parent volunteer at the Roberts Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3187.285s">I'm</a> not employed by the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3189.386s">I</a> submitted this grant application on behalf of the Roberts PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3195.058s">for</a> benefit of the nearly 600 children that attend the Roberts Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3200.0s">We're</a> home to the Autism Inclusion Program as well as the ELL Welcome Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3204.361s">We</a> are the largest elementary school in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3209.223s">So,</a> Kirsten did begin a little bit on our timeline and <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3220.094s">I</a> definitely went through a lot of processes to get to this estimate and attended a lot of meetings and spoke to several playground vendors. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3230.82s">When</a> I heard on the last two days that the bids had come in—this is very loud—double, triple, quadruple, I was very concerned about the predatory nature of this bidding process. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3244.997s">And</a> I called the Attorney General for assistance to find out why this was happening, what our alternatives were. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3252.921s">Because</a> my conversations with the several vendors that specialize in this playground equipment led me to wonder why we weren't using the Massachusetts Operational Service Division statewide contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3269.348s">I</a> was continuously told by the city that the reason we were not using them was because <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3274.6s">we</a> couldn't spend more than $50,000 to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3276.941s">But</a> I was continuously told by the people who do this work that that was not the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3285.362s">So</a> today I deep dove into it and spoke to someone at the Attorney's General's Office whose information I'm willing to provide to the city so that you can verify. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3294.024s">And</a> they told me that in 2016, the Chapter 30B procurement laws were altered. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3304.158s">And</a> the alteration meant that it's not a $50,000 cap on materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3308.62s">The</a> material purchase is unlimited. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3310.981s">Let</a> me say that again. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3312.762s">The</a> material purchase is unlimited for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3316.203s">The</a> labor costs prior to 2016 were capped at $10,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3321.305s">The</a> labor costs for this project now are capped at $50,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3326.558s">So</a> I found that very interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3328.338s">I</a> reached out to a vendor that the Medford Public Schools has used before, the same vendor that I used to create my application. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3335.72s">If</a> you turn to the last page of my handout, I have the itemized budget that was presented to the CPC. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3345.581s">If</a> you'll note the bottom line before the total, it says installation and rubber interlocking tiles, $87,540. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3355.749s">This</a> estimate was for the 5,876 square foot playground at the Roberts Elementary School with rubber interlocking tile with a six foot fall height. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3370.283s">So</a> I reached to that vendor and said, we have an urgent issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3373.326s">Our</a> city is being told that they have to spend triple or quadruple the price that you gave me in February. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3380.032s">What</a> happened? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3381.824s">and</a> he rushed me out an estimate. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3384.025s">In</a> his estimate, he included extra square footage. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3387.067s">The</a> square footage that he included was 6,096 square feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3392.83s">He</a> included the installation and the materials cost at $89,681. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3399.294s">The</a> copy machine broke. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3400.315s">I</a> don't have copies for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3401.655s">I'm</a> happy to email, and I do have one extra copy that can be passed around. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3408.026s">As</a> I told the CPC when I presented my original bid, the labor cost for this project will be no more than 25% of that total price. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3414.99s">No</a> more than 25% of that total price is approximately $22,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3417.191s">$22,000</a> is $28,000 below the $50,000 labor threshold that would allow us to bypass the open bid process that has not attracted the proper people. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3437.268s">So</a> I have the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3440.369s">We</a> can use the FAC 104. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3442.91s">This</a> information is confirmed by the Attorney General's Office, the Operational Service Division, as well as DCAM, which stands for Division of Capital Asset Management and Maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3455.354s">I</a> spent more than an hour and a half on the phone today with Brian O'Donnell at the Attorney General's Office. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3461.216s">This</a> process ensures that the labor <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3467.414s">requirements</a> are met, the fair wage is paid, everything that's required under Chapter 30B is protected here. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3476.661s">I</a> beg you, before you go and ask for more money from the CPC to verify this information, I'm told that we can accept this bid and move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3489.19s">We</a> can get the full estimate <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3491.251s">and</a> move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3492.492s">We</a> don't have to ask for additional funds, we don't have to wait an additional month, and if there are more CPC funds for an additional hundred or so thousand dollars, I encourage you to do another playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3502.96s">I</a> encourage you to do something else for the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3505.862s">I</a> discourage you from paying <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3508.844s">more</a> than double the cost of this project to expedite it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3512.247s">Those</a> children deserve this project and I want them to have this project, but I do not want it to come at the cost of one single child in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3520.132s">I</a> tried to meet with people in this city to discuss this before this meeting because I do not enjoy coming down to City Hall and <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3529.973s">And</a> having to say this, I would have preferred to have come here tonight and said, thank you for getting this project underway. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3536.015s">Thank</a> you for having this happen as quickly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3539.736s">I</a> just, someone please schedule a meeting with me and I will share more of this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3545.498s">But</a> please don't spend more money than we need to on this project.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3804.255s">When</a> we initially discussed the bids and when I discussed with this vendor and before we applied with the CPC, he said that typically they prefer a landscaper or another company to do the removal because it's they don't want to send certified professional playground installation people to come out with a shovel and remove and they'll charge us much more for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3826.748s">They</a> said that they <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3827.976s">that</a> depending on the specialist you get, they can charge you $30,000, $50,000 for the removal because they really don't want to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3834.882s">And</a> one of the things that the CPC requested that I do was bring the bid down. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3839.966s">So</a> when I submitted the original price, it had with the specialist removing the product, the original product, and it was higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3848.993s">So</a> by going with a landscaper, it will be less expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3852.667s">And</a> he said when he saw the first bid that the bid was unattractive to his company because it included the removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3859.974s">He</a> did not see the second one.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3888.833s">And</a> again, he said he didn't see that bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3892.554s">I</a> did also speak to Fiona in the procurement office before the bid opened, the second bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3897.675s">And</a> I also spoke to Kirsten at the school because I went to the first contractor walkthrough. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3902.636s">where</a> zero contractors came to measure, and I said, what do we do now? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3906.878s">It</a> appears that we're not attracting any bids. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3909.478s">And</a> she said, we have bids. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3910.939s">And</a> I said, oh, we have bids? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3912.239s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3913.02s">And</a> then the next week they opened one bid, and it was in excess of $300,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3915.701s">I</a> said, if now, what do we do? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3918.342s">Well,</a> this time we reach out to vendors and try to encourage them to apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3923.083s">But</a> we have to reach out to playground vendors. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3925.294s">Because</a> this is what happens if you reach out to a general contractor. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3928.155s">The</a> general contractor says, I'm not certified to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3930.776s">You</a> know what I'm going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3931.937s">I'm</a> going to contract a playground specialist to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3935.258s">And</a> I'm going to contract him to do the entire thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3937.66s">And</a> he's going to charge me $150,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3938.94s">But</a> I want to make money, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3941.781s">So</a> he's going to charge more. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3943.382s">And</a> I don't think that chasing this down, this, my suggestion, and chase, which is not my suggestion, it's the suggestion of the Attorney General's office, and saving the city $100,000 while you can concurrently wait to go to the CPC and tell them you need more money, and if you find out that this is indeed factual, because, I'm sorry, but I don't make things up. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3964.211s">I</a> don't need to come here and embarrass myself.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3971.577s">No,</a> I talked to someone in the Attorney General's office that works with the fare wager and the construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3978.14s">So</a> he said that this Massachusetts contracts follow the prevailing wage laws.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3989.226s">You're</a> also allowed to do the bid at labor for less than a month.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4014.487s">Or</a> we could just go through the MAS contracts, the contract user guide for the FAC 104, which I'm more than willing to share with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4023.553s">learn</a> how to do it.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4027.916s">So</a> you can do the mass contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4029.217s">You</a> do not have to open the bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4030.617s">The</a> labor cost is less than $50,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4032.198s">You</a> do not have to open a bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4034.84s">You</a> can go through the mass contracts.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4149.362s">They</a> said they did not see it come up the second time. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4152.644s">I</a> was out of town. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4153.364s">I</a> didn't have time to email everyone and tell them about the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4156.085s">I</a> did actually ask Fiona to send me the information, and I did not receive an email with the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4162.313s">So</a> this was not on their radar. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4164.615s">But</a> in the handout that I gave you, there's also information on the statewide contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4168.279s">This</a> contract that I'm handing you falls into the category of statewide contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4172.523s">Who</a> may use statewide contracts? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4174.425s">Cities,</a> towns, district, counties, and other political subdivisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4178.129s">I</a> believe Medford is a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4180.531s">Buyer</a> information. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4181.492s">Why</a> would you use it? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4182.413s">Because</a> it saves time developing solicitations and issuing bids. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4187.203s">evaluating</a> responses and executing contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4190.226s">The</a> OSD has negotiated the pricing or required competitive costs, selected the appropriate vendors, and outlined the services the vendors perform relative to the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4200.454s">They</a> are subject to the Mass General Law, Chapter 30B. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4204.398s">They're</a> also subject to the wage requirements.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4215.736s">The</a> included in there is $3,000 for a rubber membrane underneath. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4219.858s">The</a> application that we submitted to the CPC also has $10,000 if we have to repair and touch up the substone. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4229.825s">It</a> also includes $12,000 for removal and disposal of rubber surfacing. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4234.908s">As</a> I said, that estimate includes labor. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4237.73s">The</a> labor is approximately 25% of that overall cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4241.511s">This</a> is not the only vendor that I've spoken to, and we got an approximate pricing for this playground.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4250.834s">I</a> attended the PTO Expo. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4253.395s">I</a> spoke to two vendors there. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4254.896s">I</a> gave them the square footage because I had it for the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4257.897s">It</a> was all around the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4260.058s">They</a> said, of course, we'd have to come out and measure and exact.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4273.27s">They're</a> registered to FAC 104 company, so they're vetted by the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4278.332s">They're</a> required to complete the prevailing wage.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4396.841s">That</a> $89,000 includes the labor. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4399.082s">They</a> do not sell the tiles without the labor because you are required to have a licensed person install the tiles. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4407.79s">That's</a> the industry standard. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4409.99s">If</a> the labor costs are below $50,000, according to the Mass General Law, Chapter 30B, which was changed in 2016, if the labor cost is under $50,000, you do not have to bid the labor. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4425.522s">The</a> labor cost will be under $25,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4427.964s">I</a> don't know if that's the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4431.587s">I</a> encourage someone to please meet with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4434.909s">I</a> will provide the name, number, <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4437.555s">of</a> the person at the Attorney General's office that I spoke to, who was chasing this down, who said that the Chapter 30B requirements require the prevailing wage, which is included in the MAS contract by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4451.525s">By</a> law.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4929.335s">If</a> I was going to do it tomorrow, I would sit down with John McLaughlin and I would say, um, I remember that you said ground masters could do the removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4937.521s">So</a> we want to get them lined up to do the removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4940.144s">We</a> also want to reach back out to, to this company that you've worked with before. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4944.767s">And</a> we want to get the itemized bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4947.069s">We</a> want it to be all laid out with the cost of the tiles. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4950.568s">the</a> cost of the installation. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4952.349s">We</a> want to know exactly how many days it's going to take. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4954.511s">We</a> want to know how long it's going to take.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4974.505s">So</a> then we would execute contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4977.427s">We</a> would begin work. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4980.238s">get</a> invoiced for the work, and the money is ready to be paid out, we would pay it out, and the children would play on a new playground, and my daughter, who's a fifth grader, would actually get to touch the new playground that we've been trying to get since she started kindergarten.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5000.017s">That's</a> who was going to do it anyway.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5088.324s">$130,000</a> to put down into locking blocks. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5090.886s">That's</a> absurd. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5092.107s">For</a> over $200,000, we could tear out the playground equipment, we could put new playground equipment in tile.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5114.322s">No,</a> that does include.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5153.274s">So</a> this bid includes... Okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5156.135s">This</a> price includes $3,000 for the rubber membrane that would go underneath the tiles.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5163.959s">Yeah,</a> so that's included in the $89,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5166.881s">So</a> if Groundmasters charges $15,000 and we needed $10,000 to replace substone underneath before we put the membrane in the tiles, we would be within $5,000 of the grant amount.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5255.695s">Of</a> course. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5256.075s">This</a> is a 24-hour turnaround. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5256.795s">Of</a> course. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5257.135s">No,</a> no, I know that.<h2><a href="../2018-05-25_gwIgYT_iFzI/2018-05-25_gwIgYT_iFzI.html">City Council Meeting 05/22/18</a></h2>

<a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3739.876s">To</a> tear down a tower that's perfectly good <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3742.652s">And</a> that right there would have saved us a million dollars that could have gone directly towards building our new fire station, but we threw that away because we apparently don't need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3751.436s">To</a> go forward with that is ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3753.517s">And</a> we see all these projects coming through. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3755.498s">Every</a> time I'm at a meeting, we see $500,000 going on Riverside Plaza to expedite it so that it could be open in the fall of 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3762.101s">And</a> if you go by, it's May of 2018, and I see mismatched furniture that looks like it came from other projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3771.322s">set</a> up there and it's still not open. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3773.223s">That's</a> $500,000 that maybe we could have cut that down and put that towards a new tower. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3779.487s">If</a> we're thinking creatively, debt exclusion is not the most creative. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3782.388s">That's</a> probably, you know, that just says, let's just take more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3785.85s">We</a> have to look at the difference going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3787.711s">Do</a> we need $1.6 million in one park when we have at least a dozen parks in 2011 that were identified in poor condition and those children will continue to play in those poor parks? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3800.088s">and</a> look over at that park that you can't park near to go and play in. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3804.511s">When</a> I visit people in that neighborhood, I often park in Tiki Island, sorry, Tiki Island, to visit friends because there's no parking on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3812.157s">So</a> we're spending money in places that we maybe need to start thinking more creatively of budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3819.022s">We</a> can't build the Taj Mahal everywhere and to tell the fire department that they can't have a station and they can't have a training tower while we're building projects at levels <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3827.925s">We</a> can't afford to maintain, we can't sustain, and we just can't afford is irresponsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3833.429s">You</a> should move to, maybe you need to spend more money on an architect and tell him he needs to build around that tower because it's irresponsible to tear down that tower. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3842.195s">The</a> million dollars that it's gonna cost to put up a new tower versus a million dollars in new architecture fees, maybe that should be the situation, and then our fire department doesn't have interrupted training schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3853.183s">Maybe</a> that's a creative solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3855.104s">I</a> think it's more creative than, <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3856.903s">Well,</a> we don't want to hold things up, so let's just knock it down and maybe we'll figure it out because the DPW, the sand and salt is coming to Mystic Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3866.388s">They've</a> already decided that that's where they want the sand and salt. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3869.73s">They</a> said that they negotiated and they sold the sign shops so that they could build a high rise of 500 units, which the firefighters will have to go into if it goes on fire, but they won't be able to train to prepare for. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3881.457s">So</a> now they want another piece of Medford land to put sand and salt on. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3885.418s">So</a> we need to think about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3886.558s">If</a> we're not going to get that land, we're going to lose that tower, and we're going to potentially lose lives.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6604.929s">Hi,</a> I'm Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6607.731s">I'm</a> here to speak on the resurfacing project for the Roberts Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6612.373s">It's</a> the second item down on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6615.295s">We're</a> very concerned about the timing of this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6617.896s">School</a> lets out on June 20th and school resumes on the last week of August. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6622.019s">This</a> project needs to be done during the school break. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6625.28s">We</a> have to go out for bidding and then schedule the work during probably the busiest time of the year, so it's gonna be very hard for us to schedule one week <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6633.738s">could</a> mean that the children have to wait an extra year for this project, so I'm hoping that perhaps an exception can be made and this project can be approved this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6641.262s">I</a> can answer any questions that anyone has. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6648.605s">We</a> have photographs of the project as well.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6688.366s">I</a> am the-.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6924.348s">And</a> I just want to interject that this board council has already approved an off-cycle application. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6930.871s">We're</a> not an off-cycle application. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6932.692s">I</a> submitted the application on January 5th, the initial application. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6936.313s">Then</a> I submitted the full application the first week of March. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6940.202s">I've</a> been to several meetings for the CPA and presented this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6944.303s">I've</a> been to meetings at the school committee to present this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6947.463s">I've</a> been to subcommittee meetings of the school committee to submit this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6952.404s">I</a> prepared the 65-page application for this project, collected signatures and support for this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6958.645s">So</a> I am more than capable of answering any questions that you have on this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6963.386s">And</a> I think that I'm more than happy to come tomorrow if you have additional questions and answer it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6970.02s">but</a> this project is very time sensitive, and to tell these children that they could possibly have to wait an additional year for the largest elementary school in the city with the English language learner program, the autism program, this would break a lot of hearts. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6984.085s">So</a> please, I ask you to consider us.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7011.4s">I've</a> gotten conflicting answers on this, but I'm told that until the money is approved by this council, they won't prepare the bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7018.483s">I</a> spoke to Cassandra in engineering today. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7020.364s">She</a> said it could take 45 days for the bid and that has to be advertised for two weeks, I was told by the procurement office. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7027.267s">So</a> we're really pushing up against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7029.588s">And</a> just getting in the schedules of these people once we do go through that process could really push us up to the end of the summer.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7040.694s">The</a> actual work is projected to take between five and 10 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7044.116s">Five</a> and 10 days, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7045.097s">And</a> we were asked to make our application smaller just because this is only for the surfacing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7050.42s">There's</a> not a bench or a flower in this application. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7053.962s">So</a> we actually need a landscaper to do removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7056.51s">And</a> then we need a playground specialist to do the installation because we were told there's very limited funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7063.377s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7294.873s">We're</a> concerned that the city is not going to move forward in preparing the bid until this money is allocated. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7301.425s">We're</a> talking about waiting until after Memorial Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7303.506s">It'll</a> be less than a month before school lets out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7306.488s">So</a> if we do a 45-day bid, we're talking about sometime in July when the bid will end, and then we have to try to get on the schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7312.852s">We'll</a> need to be on the schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7314.793s">We'll</a> probably have about a 35-day window, less than that, actually, because we need to allocate 10 days to do the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7321.277s">So</a> we'll have 25 days to get on the schedule of the chosen bid to do the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7327.461s">So</a> seven days could be, <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7331.133s">the</a> difference between doing it now and saying, do you have any time in July of 2019? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7339.296s">So</a> that's an entire year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7343.277s">Or</a> the kids go back to school, and there's caution tape and construction vehicles, which would complement the construction on the corner of Court Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7353.44s">So</a> we really don't want to disrupt the children's recess time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7357.541s">It's</a> a very coveted time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7360.392s">well</a> utilized in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7362.093s">It's</a> the only playground that has, the school playground has lighting at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7366.135s">The</a> neighborhood children play there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7367.456s">You'll</a> often see children there till 8 or 9 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7370.297s">because</a> it's a lit area. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7372.298s">Hickey</a> Park is down the street, but it's pitch dark. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7374.919s">It's</a> not able to be used by the neighbors at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7379.082s">So</a> it's a difference between now, it could be a difference between now and a year.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7416.58s">It's</a> already been signed by the mayor.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7470.609s">I</a> understand that if there's controversy with papers tomorrow, that perhaps these papers will stay in committee for a week or two longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7478.275s">We</a> could be talking about June before this is approved?
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7495.429s">And</a> will this be voted on as a whole tomorrow, or will there be possibility of parcelization? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7500.113s">I'm</a> just trying to find out what's going to happen.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7692.066s">And</a> the great thing about doing it in the summer is that it's light out till 8.30 at night, so they'll have a playground a couple of blocks away. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7699.828s">If</a> we wait until the fall, when it starts getting dark at 4.30, 5 o'clock, there'll be nothing.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7739.587s">I</a> hope, if nothing else, that I've expressed the urgency of this project so that if this paper gets bogged down tomorrow, perhaps you would consider not punishing 550 plus school children and letting this project move forward.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7780.968s">point</a> of clarification, what I actually said was I hope that if this paper gets bogged down tomorrow with other issues, that it's not delayed and what will happen is the children will be punished. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7793.975s">It's</a> an unintended consequence, so that's just why we're here, to make sure that you're aware that that's a possibility, and we hope that you'll consider and think about that.<h2><a href="../2018-04-26_I5lIrWN8Vh8/2018-04-26_I5lIrWN8Vh8.html">Community Preservation Committee Meeting 04/24/18</a></h2>

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=178.625s">Okay,</a> so hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=180.467s">I'm</a> representing the Roberts PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=183.99s">We</a> put in our application for the surfacing of our playground to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=188.874s">The</a> surface of the playground was put in around 2003 when the school opened, and it was slated to last for eight to 10 years, so now it's past replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=199.543s">I</a> brought the actual pictures if it's easier for the committee to look at, thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=206.349s">So</a> we're at a point where this is poor in place and they've been trying to patch, but this is what it looks like today. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=213.825s">Close</a> to 600 students play on this playground every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=217.206s">We're</a> the largest elementary school in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=219.807s">So</a> this is very well utilized. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=222.128s">Just</a> today on this beautiful day when I went to pick up my daughter, there were probably 30 to 40 younger siblings playing on the playground before dismissal and easily 200 after school. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=232.032s">So</a> this is a well-loved and utilized playground to the point that when I went to get my pictures, I could not find a day to take a picture where there wasn't a family playing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=241.355s">So</a> we're just hoping to have the surfacing done. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=243.777s">We</a> made this application as lean as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=246.199s">We</a> haven't asked for anything other than the surfacing. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=249.522s">The</a> playground equipment was inspected and found to be <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=253.327s">fine</a> and can continue to be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=255.408s">We</a> haven't asked for a bench or a planting. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=257.128s">We've</a> only asked for the surfacing. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=259.229s">We</a> picked rubber interlocking tile, which needs to be professionally installed. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=264.13s">The</a> reason we picked that is because it has zero maintenance requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=267.572s">So</a> this won't happen again. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=268.732s">We</a> won't have the holes. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=270.572s">It'll</a> be just like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=271.513s">So</a> if there is damage to a tile, a tile can be replaced singly. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=276.24s">And</a> it'll look like this for the next 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=280.388s">So</a> it's really a great product. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=282.632s">It's</a> extremely safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=284.516s">And</a> we're excited to have a new playground.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=313.223s">It's</a> open to the public outside of the school day. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=316.004s">So</a> during the school day, it's just the students, but outside of the school day, in the summer, on the weekends, at night, it's very well used. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=323.987s">Can</a> I make a comment on it?
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=336.792s">Yes,</a> it is lit.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=378.723s">Well,</a> I started trying to find funding for this project when my daughter was in kindergarten. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=384.686s">My</a> daughter is now a fourth grader, so yay, we're hoping she's going to get that one more year at the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=390.85s">I</a> was told that I could fundraise the money if I had wanted to, and our PTO was not in a position to raise $100,000 extra. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=401.115s">We</a> do provide a lot of funding for the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=402.916s">We</a> do enrichment nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=404.784s">We're</a> preparing for field day. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=405.985s">We</a> buy t-shirts for all the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=407.386s">We</a> have entertainment, snacks. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=410.649s">We</a> do the book fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=412.27s">We</a> buy books for the library, books for the teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=415.433s">We</a> buy school supplies at the beginning of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=417.514s">We</a> do in-school enrichment. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=418.835s">We</a> pay for buses for field trips. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=420.577s">So</a> we're around $25,000 in expenses a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=424.92s">And</a> it's a very dynamic and involved group that helps to raise these funds and we're very fortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=431.664s">But</a> $100,000 we would be raising for the next probably 20 years because we still have to provide that core amount of funding every year.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=448.915s">Right,</a> this project has to go out to bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=450.596s">Unfortunately,</a> I tried to make the application leaner by saying, oh, can we do the demo? <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=455.218s">Because</a> that was around $30,000 just for the demo. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=458.68s">We</a> were able to talk to the playground company, and they said if we hired a landscaper, that would be half the cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=465.763s">So</a> that's how we took out some there, and they said by having it professionally done, it could decrease the amount of repair we have to do to the substructure when we take it out, but it has to be done by hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=476.53s">It</a> cannot be done with a machine, unfortunately. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=480.413s">So,</a> yeah, unfortunately, because it's city land, we cannot just have volunteers go in there and tear it out and put it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=486.817s">And</a> because of the intricacy of the installation, it has to be professionally done.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=511.896s">I</a> like to be in control, so I hope to leave this meeting and speak to the Building and Grounds Subcommittee and say, we really want to be on the ground the day after, if we make it through this round, the day after the City Council hears this, we want the bid to go out immediately and do it as quickly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=530.963s">They</a> told us it was five to ten days of construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=534.484s">We</a> would not want to do it in September, it would be very sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=538.471s">But</a> we really do want to have this done as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=541.133s">We</a> have another project where we're going to be painting the rainbow outside the school, so we want this to be a fabulous start to the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=552.684s">And</a> I do have a school committee member with me, Aaron DeBenedetto.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=734.872s">So</a> our estimate includes $10,000 in repair to the substrate so hopefully it'll be less but they said they did that on the high side so that we wouldn't have a surprise coming in.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=752.367s">They</a> actually said they can do it without removing any of the equipment, which is amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=755.948s">And</a> I'll be down there watching them do it, because there's a lot of equipment there. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=760.23s">And</a> they're going to install the tiles one by one and cut each one to fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=766.173s">So</a> we're getting a really custom product here.<h2><a href="../2018-04-10_vqZ0fsWQ1g0/2018-04-10_vqZ0fsWQ1g0.html">Medford School Committee meeting April 9, 2018</a></h2>
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3382.676s">We'll</a> get a report on that one, I'm sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3385.299s">That's</a> April 24th, the CPA presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3388.561s">But</a> yeah, Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3392.244s">I</a> just wanted to bring up the topic of bullying. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3396.068s">I</a> noticed that as the children get older, there's a little buzz here.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3420.282s">It's</a> on. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3421.984s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3422.365s">So</a> I just wanted to come in and bring up the topic of bullying. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3425.809s">I've</a> noticed that as <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3428.625s">As</a> technology gets more prolific, bullying seems to get more severe. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3434.026s">When</a> I was a child, if there was a bully, they were at school and maybe on the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3438.647s">But</a> when you got home, you were safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3440.787s">And</a> now it seems that bullying has extended beyond the school, schoolyard, buses, to your homes if your child is on any kind of social media, texting app, anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3457.4s">Even</a> as a parent of a 22 year old, I didn't have to deal with this and I'm finding it difficult and I'm hoping that the school will be willing to implement some kind of a program, maybe something that the PTOs can help work with or we can work with the computer teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3475.16s">the</a> district works with the Michigan model and when I looked them up I found they have a bully free school circle of support type of program. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3484.083s">I</a> think what's really important in this type of program would be not only to do the principals, the teachers, the students, but also the parents because we're in a position where we don't exactly know <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3496.412s">how</a> to guide our children, and if we're not guiding all the children in the same direction, it's great to tell your child to block somebody else, but if they then go on someone else's page and start harassing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3509.643s">We</a> had a situation in my particular family, and I put a post on Facebook, and I was amazed at how many messages that I got from friends from different schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3519.01s">It's</a> not a Medford unique problem, <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3523.262s">Things</a> like that they had bullying and they went to their principal for help and the principal told them, you know, boys will be boys or it's your turn to get bullying. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3532.062s">Children</a> that were getting bullied so badly in their schools that they were going online and saying that they were going to commit suicide, or students that were harassed so heavily that they were scratching themselves or cutting themselves as young as elementary school. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3549.354s">So</a> I'm really concerned about this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3551.856s">It's</a> touched my family personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3553.997s">One</a> of those stories is about someone in my family. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3558.395s">but</a> I prefer not to say which one. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3561.356s">So</a> I'm hoping that we can have some kind of collaboration. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3563.778s">I</a> know that right now, most of our bullying issues go through either the adjustment Councilor or the principal, and maybe it's not working for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3574.343s">I</a> know that the issue that we were having personally had gone through the adjustment Councilor, and we didn't hear about it for a couple weeks later after a student reported an issue <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3587.682s">My</a> daughter wasn't spoken to for two additional weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3590.843s">And</a> if that had escalated, that could have been a really serious problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3594.865s">So</a> I'm hoping that maybe we can set up a committee that has parents on it, or you can have a subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3600.907s">But</a> bullying is something that we, anyone that was at that five hour meeting or watched it on television, probably about half of the people that spoke at that meeting talked about relentless bullying that their students were going through, their children. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3613.052s">So</a> I really just wanted to come here and say that I hope that <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3617.25s">when</a> you go to hire a new superintendent, maybe that's a question of what they want to do about bullying, and we can do something about it, because I need help.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3637.944s">This</a> was just the bully-free school circle of support. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3641.566s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3642.227s">And</a> it just emphasized that you had to have people at all levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3646.81s">They</a> had training for the teachers, but they also had training for the parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3650.392s">This</a> was on their website. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3651.993s">I</a> just have one copy that you can have.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3656.796s">Yeah,</a> I can email it to you.

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4271.015s">Sure,</a> and I just while we wait for him to walk up, I want to make one point is I didn't come here to be like let's take all the bullies and suspend them out of the school because I think the issue is a lot more complicated than punishing the bully. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4282.763s">I'd</a> like more education around the socio and emotional about how to treat each other and that just because you're mad at your friend doesn't mean you <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4290.29s">relentlessly</a> torture them, and then three days later, they're best friends again, but they've done damage to each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4295.371s">So</a> I just want to point that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4296.271s">Thank</a> you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4296.831s">Rodriguez.</a> <h2><a href="../2018-02-06_XMHnwGJ5osA/2018-02-06_XMHnwGJ5osA.html">Medford School Committee February 5, 2018</a></h2>
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5332.996s">Hi,</a> Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5335.658s">So</a> yeah, I went to the subcommittee meeting last week, and Mr. John McLaughlin from the Buildings and Grounds had given us an estimate. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5343.924s">I</a> ended up reaching out to that person. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5345.865s">During</a> the course of the meeting, it was suggested by Mr. Belson that perhaps rubber tiles would be better. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5351.869s">I</a> spoke to him on the phone, and the rubber tiles are far more durable. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5355.531s">They'll</a> last us probably close to 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5358.113s">They</a> require zero maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5359.753s">If</a> we get the pour in place, if we want it to last about 12 years, we would need to invest about $10,000 five to seven years in to reseal it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5370.835s">And</a> it's cheaper to actually get the rubber tiles. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5373.096s">The</a> estimate was around $85,000 as opposed to $92,000, so it would save money. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5378.157s">The</a> playground apparatus doesn't need to come out, and as was discussed, the playground apparatus is right now in very good shape compared to the <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5386.709s">to</a> the surfacing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5390.03s">The</a> man also suggested, I believe his name was Travis, that we could lower the cost of the estimate by having a landscaping company, or maybe we had people within the city that would be able to take out the old rubber surfacing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5402.754s">Their</a> estimate for that was $25,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5405.175s">He</a> said that was because he had high-level professionals that do the playgrounds coming in to do that, and it was something that he said could be done with a shovel that a landscaper would know how to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5416.402s">And</a> they would probably give us an estimate of $10,000 to $12,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5420.068s">Possibly</a> we could even get that lower if we had a resource in the community or someone that we could reach out to. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5428.017s">If</a> the substone is in good shape, that $10,000 that was put in for that could go down or be eliminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5434.801s">So</a> the goal for us right now is to try to make our application as lean as possible, show as much community support as we can, which would include things like getting workers in the community to help us out. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5447.988s">And</a> if the city was able, if there is a line item coming up in our budget for other playground services, if we combined more than one estimate, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5457.253s">we</a> would save additional $1 to $2 per square foot, which just for the Roberts playground would be anywhere from $5,400 to $11,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5467.061s">So</a> it could make a significant difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5470.323s">I'm</a> hoping that someone in the committee or the mayor is interested in helping work towards this application. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5479.17s">I</a> am, again, just a <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5480.528s">a</a> parent volunteer, trying to do the best that I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5483.23s">I'm</a> hoping that the Roberts can serve as the model and the first step, and we can get the other schools in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5489.034s">I</a> know that the other schools do need this done as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5493.457s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5495.338s">And</a> the meeting, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5496.459s">The</a> meeting is, we're meeting with the commission for the community preservation on February 13th. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5502.183s">Our</a> meeting is at 7.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5503.804s">It's</a> an open meeting, but we don't have a room. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5505.545s">It's</a> here at City Hall.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5668.894s">It</a> was it was a seven foot fall height Which was the exact same as the estimate that mr. McLaughlin had presented for the park.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5681.103s">It</a> can't be done by farm equipment He said it has to be done by shovels because we don't want to destroy the substone So that was why the estimate was so high from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5690.63s">Yeah,</a> it's manual labor manual labor. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5693.072s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5693.432s">I</a> 
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5811.304s">And</a> they're going to ask me for an update on where we are.

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=915.049s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=916.805s">Hi,</a> I'm Cheryl Rodriguez, dean of my address. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=919.367s">I</a> live at 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=921.869s">I'm</a> an active parent volunteer involved in the Roberts PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=925.612s">And</a> one of the things that I do for the school is that I apply for grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=930.876s">So</a> since I'm here, I wanted to let everyone know that we did receive a $5,000 grant from the Lowell's Toolbox for Education. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=937.541s">It</a> covered about 90% of the cost for 25 Google Chromebooks, the software, and the cart that is now in the school and will be ready for circulation at the end of this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=947.631s">Excellent.</a> 
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=953.837s">And</a> we used money from the Jingle Bell Festival to cover the rest of that cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=958.928s">We</a> made, I don't have the exact figure, but it's a little under $7,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=961.774s">We</a> were the number one school this year.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=965.481s">So</a> that was great for them too. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=969.256s">So</a> today I'm here to ask for support and help for the Roberts PTO's grant application to the Community Preservation Commission for the restoration of our school playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=978.685s">The</a> Roberts Elementary School is one of the most populous elementary schools in Medford and our playground, as are all the elementary school playgrounds, is in need of replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=987.413s">The</a> worst item in all our playgrounds seems to be the surfacing. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=990.954s">So</a> I applied for this grant for a few reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=993.735s">One</a> was that I saw the mayor's capital improvement plan at a city council meeting, and it included line items to replace one school playground per year, which was great. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1003.04s">And</a> I thought if we coupled it with community preservation money, we could replace two playgrounds per year, and everyone could have a new playground in two to three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1012.025s">So</a> that would be about 2,400 students in our elementary schools that would all have a shiny new playground to play in. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1018.598s">So</a> that benefit would radiate out through the neighborhood that each school is in, because it will allow their family members of the students to enjoy the playgrounds as well as people that just live in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1029.321s">We've</a> gone through the eligibility phase, and we now have to prepare a complete application. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1036.123s">So</a> we don't know exactly how much it's going to cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1039.544s">And</a> we need help from the district in order to <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1042.966s">figure</a> out the parameters of what you'll require, companies that we have to go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1047.429s">This</a> is outside of my scope of expertise, as well as my authority as a parent volunteer at the Roberts Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1054.775s">We</a> were able to apply with a supporting letter from the principal at our school. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1059.799s">But</a> in order to go forward, we need approval and help from <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1064.077s">the</a> school committee and the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1066.219s">So</a> I'm hoping that we're going to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1069.081s">The</a> application needs to be submitted by March 2nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1072.764s">I'm</a> hoping that we'll make it through the first round because that will allow for completion to happen in the summer when the students are not in school so that they won't have any interrupted recess time and they'll be able to start September with a shiny new playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1085.919s">If</a> we do receive community preservation funds, there are other grants that we can apply for to help supplement, but we're not eligible to apply for those grants until we receive funding from the community preservation. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1100.126s">So</a> I'm hoping that you guys can help me out.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4411.348s">Hi,</a> I'm Cheryl Rodriguez again, 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4414.429s">I</a> am an active member of my PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4417.19s">No</a> one personally approached me, but I can tell you that my PTO sends constant flyers. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4423.412s">They</a> have events almost monthly. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4425.653s">Every</a> PTO does this. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4427.073s">We</a> have Facebook pages. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4429.034s">Some</a> of us have Twitter accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4431.415s">We</a> make every effort to have people join. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4433.916s">I'm</a> not a board member on a PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4435.757s">I</a> went to a PTO meeting and I raised my hand and volunteered. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4440.568s">I've</a> added programming to my PTO on a voluntary basis, and people do the best that they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4447.358s">I've</a> gone to meetings where there's been three people, and I know for a fact that a flyer's gone out, that a flyer's been on the window at the school, that we've posted it on our Facebook page. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4457.406s">And</a> there's three people there. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4459.107s">And</a> that's not because we're not engaging our community, because we have signs up at every event that things are going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4464.849s">We</a> send out emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4466.65s">There's</a> only so much that you can do, but you have to be realistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4470.011s">When</a> I had my first child, I worked full time, and I did not volunteer at the PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4474.053s">I</a> did not have the time or the bandwidth. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4476.134s">I'm</a> lucky now that I can and I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4478.715s">And</a> I appreciate that a lot of people are not able to do that, and I don't think <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4483.157s">that</a> we should be disparaging people on either side, people that do have the time to volunteer, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4487.681s">People</a> that don't, you know, that's fine too. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4490.363s">We're</a> here for all of the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4491.944s">We</a> do fundraising for every child. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4494.666s">in</a> all the schools, and we're not singling out and go, oh, Johnny's mother didn't help, so he doesn't get a t-shirt on field day. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4500.608s">So</a> I think we need to remember that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4502.469s">And</a> I hope that some of your recommendations will include ways to help some of our PTOs, especially those of us that are in high needs districts, high needs areas, where our parents do work two jobs, or our parents don't speak English, or they have special needs children they have to attend to, or they have three or four children, and packing those kids up and coming to a PTO meeting is impossible. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4523.857s">We</a> even tried to do our meetings on Facebook Live. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4526.897s">And</a> it didn't increase our attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4530.058s">So</a> we're all doing the best that we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4532.219s">And</a> I hope that the district is able to help us. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4535.019s">Because</a> from year to year, some PTOs find that it's really hard for them to afford that $8,000 to $10,000 that we need for the buses, or that field day event, or that in-school enrichment. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4545.623s">And</a> we do the best that we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4547.343s">Sometimes</a> you run a fundraiser, and you think you're going to make $1,000, and you make $500. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4550.804s">And</a> you have to add another fundraiser on the fly, because you're not going to cover those bills at the end of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4557.401s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2017-10-20_o7jpBFH8Da0/2017-10-20_o7jpBFH8Da0.html">Medford City Council Candidates Forum 10/18/17</a></h2>
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4669.231s">Hi,</a> my name is Cheryl Rodriguez, and I'm running for a seat on the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4673.434s">Thanks</a> to the Democratic Committee of Ward 6 for hosting us. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4677.017s">When</a> I received the email listing the nearly 30 City Council topics, my first reaction was, wow, that's a lot of stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4684.823s">I</a> think that's what intrigued me about running for City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4688.005s">It's</a> a pretty unique opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4689.807s">You</a> get to wear lots of hats, but it all boils down to quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4694.27s">I'm</a> a graduate of Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4695.852s">I</a> have a daughter who graduated in 2014, and a nine-year-old in the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4700.656s">My</a> parents also live in Medford, and my husband Alexis Rodriguez is a candidate for school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4705.721s">I'm</a> a mom in the community who is heavily involved in the Roberts School PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4710.245s">I'm</a> proud to say that I have committed to creating enrichment nights, running fundraisers, and applying for grants to help our children create memories at school. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4718.79s">I'm</a> grateful to the teachers and principal for trusting me and working tirelessly on these inclusive events. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4724.838s">And</a> thanks to all the parents who've helped in ways you never thought you would, like lugging a U-Haul's truck worth of yard sale items out of my house, or punching holes in nearly 600 pieces of artwork for our art show. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4736.718s">I</a> love Medford because there are so many great volunteer and service-oriented groups in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4741.921s">I</a> would really like to find a way to link them all. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4744.863s">Often</a> I hear, I wish we had a group that was working on X, and oftentimes we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4749.666s">I've</a> met many amazing groups of people working to make the lives of people in our community better, and I've tried to help whenever I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4757.03s">Many</a> of the events that we enjoy throughout the city are run by volunteers. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4762.908s">My</a> commitment to the city made me want to run for city council to try to help in a different way. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4768.011s">I've</a> attended meetings, met with elected officials for years to try and get assistance on various issues and needs around the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4774.774s">I've</a> stood with Locust Street of Butters to stop overdevelopment. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4778.176s">I've</a> collected signatures outside Stop and Shop for charter review. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4781.678s">I've</a> advocated for airplane noise relief, fought for small class sizes, and to this day, I still continue to go to zoning board meetings and stand with residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4792.777s">I</a> want to be that person that you feel comfortable reaching out to, the one who will not only listen to your issue, but will dig in to find the best solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4800.828s">I</a> would also like to help push for a portion of our budget to be set aside for future maintenance projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4806.577s">We</a> all know that roofs don't last forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4808.598s">It</a> doesn't have to be a scramble every time one springs a leak. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4811.9s">This</a> will speed things up and help manage expectations. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4815.582s">Money</a> set aside each year in the budget for streets and roads will allow us to fix more in our limited construction season. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4821.585s">This</a> is just one part of our needed city plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4824.407s">We</a> hear that Medford is hot. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4825.728s">We</a> need to take control so that the projects being built here enhance our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4829.91s">Medford</a> needs to be a place where people work, eat, play, and live. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4833.812s">A</a> proper plan will keep us from turning into a bedroom community that creates no places for the people who live here to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4840.237s">I</a> see Mystic Ave as our blank space, our next big opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4844.499s">I</a> know a project with 500 apartments and a tiny amount of commercial is proposed for the center lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4849.483s">I</a> think placing it there would be a mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4851.624s">We</a> need to think bigger. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4853.125s">We</a> need to stop the small-town thinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4855.447s">Projects</a> should not be approved because it is better than what is there now. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4859.049s">Yes,</a> most anything is better than nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4861.251s">But</a> remember, Medford's hot. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4862.992s">Cities</a> that are hot don't just take what is offered. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4865.753s">We</a> ask for what we want and what we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4868.453s">That</a> is how you move the city forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4870.494s">That's</a> how Medford will come alive. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4873.095s">Mystic</a> Ave could be our premier commercial area. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4875.475s">It</a> could hold lab space, office space, an entertainment complex, a beer garden, a doggie daycare, restaurants, a hotel. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4882.337s">The</a> sky's the limit. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4883.937s">If</a> there seems to be a need for some residential, it can be placed at an extreme end of the street to not impact our commercial growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4891.299s">Picture</a> a center island with trees on it, bike lanes, beautiful wide sidewalks, a shuttle to the train station, another bringing people to the square to enjoy lunch, dinner, a show at the Chevalier Theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4902.453s">This</a> is the biggest opportunity in Medford to create this shining new district. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4907.739s">All</a> we have to do is ask for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4909.421s">Don't</a> settle. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4910.843s">While</a> we're at it, we should move to our zoning reform. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4914.065s">In</a> addition to stopping overdevelopment and parcelization that is burdening our neighborhoods, our zoning should be updated so that all new construction housing projects that don't meet the threshold to add affordable units pay into our housing affordability fund to be used in conjunction with CPA money to create affordable housing in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4935.037s">This</a> is a minor ask and one that other cities don't hesitate to require. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4939.98s">Medford</a> is growing, but like anything, we need to nurture it and guide it. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4944.142s">In</a> a well-planned city, that growth maintains a balance of commercial and residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4949.506s">We</a> need to leverage enough new commercial to be able to afford needed infrastructure improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4956.049s">I'm</a> excited to dig in and be a part of this pivotal time in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4958.971s">I'm</a> a first-time candidate, long-time advocate for Medford. <a

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4797.87s">Hi,</a> I'm Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4799.23s">I</a> live at 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4802.211s">And</a> the first thing that everyone says when we talk about Medford is the Medford market is hot. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4806.552s">There</a> was an article this Sunday in the Globe about, hey, Medford, move there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4810.013s">That</a> place is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4812.034s">And</a> Boston Magazine had an article recently about North Medford being great. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4816.015s">You</a> know what's great about the city being great already is that we're not desperate. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4821.346s">We</a> don't have to sell to the guy who sends you that letter in the mail that says, hey, I'll buy you a house sight unseen for $300,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4828.233s">Because</a> you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4828.934s">There</a> are families with children that want to move to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4833.358s">Because</a> we have a deep history. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4834.88s">We</a> have a fabulous community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4837.102s">We</a> have a spirit of volunteerism that is unmatched in other towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4840.726s">And</a> you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4842.398s">Paul</a> Revere rode through here yesterday, and it was a very different Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4845.98s">We</a> need to hold on to those pieces of history. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4849.203s">Back</a> in the day that I was at Medford High, Dr. Valeriani, AP US History, sent us all out to research our homes, to trace the history. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4857.848s">And</a> we went into the tombs of the Cambridge District Court and traced the history. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4862.151s">And</a> the home that my childhood home was a beautiful double lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4866.254s">I</a> won't give the address, because I don't want any developers going and destroying it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4872.557s">When</a> my grandparents moved to Florida, we left the book that I had made in high school that had traced the history all the way back to the shipbuilding days. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4880.984s">Because</a> Medford is steeped with history, and it's important to all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4885.147s">My</a> parents bought their home, and there were pictures of ships that had been built in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4890.071s">And</a> these things are important. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4891.232s">These</a> things need to be preserved. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4893.313s">I</a> bought my own home here, and I got my own little Medford acre, which is a big yard. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4898.597s">And</a> if you add up the square footage, I could probably build four units, but that's not what I want. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4904.559s">I</a> want to keep Medford the way that it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4907.8s">And</a> what we need, we do need to grow and expand, but we don't need to go down the streets and look in people's yards and say, I could put three in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4915.302s">I</a> could. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4916.362s">That's</a> not the kind of building that we're looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4920.603s">So</a> I think that you should definitely pass this ordinance to do the 18 to 24 demo display delay, because the fastest way to get a legal opinion back from this administration is to pass something. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4931.627s">And</a> that's like, whoa! <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4933.347s">And</a> then you'll have your answer inside of a week, definitely. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4936.268s">And</a> with all due respect, if I put in and I'm looking for information and I don't get follow-up, <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4941.91s">From</a> the person I sent out to, I'll keep bothering them every two weeks, every month, because August 2016, not having an answer is totally unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4951.496s">And</a> I understand that people in this administration are busy, but if this is important to us, zoning is important to us.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4983.762s">Well,</a> September, that's a big difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4986.142s">That</a> 30 days, I mean, keep waiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4988.403s">What</a> are we on, seven months now? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4991.023s">I</a> feel like this is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4992.564s">Every</a> time I go down to the building office and I look through those books, I see demo, demo permit, demo permit, demo permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5000.365s">This</a> needs to be done now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5002.425s">We</a> don't have time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5003.226s">If</a> you wait six more months to put this in committee, I'm not sure how long that moratorium has been in the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5008.907s">I</a> waited, was at a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5011.307s">for</a> your subcommittee and you're waiting for an opinion on that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5014.049s">These</a> things are happening and they're happening now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5016.97s">And</a> once these houses are knocked down, they're gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5019.311s">You</a> can't rebuild. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5020.372s">You</a> can't, oh, well, let's rebuild that 1890 house. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5022.733s">We</a> never should have knocked it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5024.174s">It's</a> gonna be too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5025.495s">So</a> we need to move faster because we don't need any more prefab condos that are going up that cost more than a single family house. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5032.278s">And</a> single family houses, people are desperate to get those in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5035.64s">So</a> I don't know why we wanna knock them down. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5038.781s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7535.97s">Hi,</a> I'm Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7537.131s">I</a> live at 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7538.592s">My</a> street is designated as a main artery. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7541.595s">So</a> I think we have the street cleaning is supposed to commence in April and begin end on October 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7549.922s">I</a> hope that part of the discussion will include the main arteries, because what we really need on those arteries is enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7556.408s">I,</a> like Councilor Dela Rousseau, get the <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7559.838s">1</a> to 2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7560.579s">wake-up</a> call, now twice a week for the street cleaners coming in the middle of the night. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7564.622s">But</a> I often look out the window and note that even though one night is odd and one night is even, the street cleaner has to go around a car. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7571.488s">So</a> if there's no enforcement, then those roads aren't actually getting cleaned, and my husband will go out the next day with the shovel and pick up the debris on the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7579.534s">broken</a> glass and such, that hasn't been picked up by the street cleaner because someone is parked in front of our house. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7584.976s">So</a> that's important as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7586.876s">Also,</a> when you do the clean sweep in the fall, because street cleaning on the main arteries has ended, we don't get street cleaning after October 30th, so all the leaves are in the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7597.88s">And</a> the neighbors will go out and take care of those as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7600.642s">So</a> if we're not going to have enforcement, then increased street cleaning is not going to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7604.305s">I</a> know that the police are taxed, but that should be something that is included in the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7609.049s">Because</a> even though we have the signs on our street every 10 to 20 feet, there's a sign that says, move on Wednesday night, move on Thursday night, the cars are not moving and nothing's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7618.457s">The</a> street cleaners are just going around them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7620.539s">So</a> that's not really useful for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7623.401s">I</a> do hope that it will do more street cleaning. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7625.263s">My</a> father lives on Garfield Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7627.045s">and</a> he's frequently cleaning out the catch basins because they don't get the regular cleaning. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7631.047s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2017-10-05_r-uaa_v8IPE/2017-10-05_r-uaa_v8IPE.html">Medford, MA City Council - Mar. 21, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7742.625s">Hi,</a> I'm Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7743.666s">I</a> live at 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7745.889s">And</a> I'm pretty happy to see that this is coming up, because I've spoken here countless times about that we need to follow zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7754.4s">But</a> the second part of that is that we also need to look at the zoning that we currently have and see if that zoning is working for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7761.112s">I</a> pulled out a zoning map of Medford today and I looked around my neighborhood and I saw that all of Salem Street and pretty much every street from Fulton Street to 93 was zoned apartment 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7773.138s">And</a> as I drove here and took 10 minutes to drive from Park Street to City Hall, which is pretty crazy because it's four blocks, all the traffic, I thought, can we really handle that many apartment buildings? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7785.385s">on</a> Salem Street in that area with traffic, with the school that's the largest elementary school in the city, and overcrowded? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7794.211s">No,</a> we can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7794.952s">So</a> we really need to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7796.653s">I</a> know that there is calls for hiring consultants, but that can take a lot of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7801.216s">Anyone</a> who attended the zoning meeting on the Salem Street project said, well, you know, one apartment building isn't going to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7807.24s">But</a> they did have a stack of support letters from people that owned property on Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7813.845s">that</a> would probably be the next buildings that come up and want to add apartment buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7818.086s">So</a> that could be six more buildings in the next year or two, 10 more buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7822.008s">Then</a> we'd swing around down Fountain Street and add another 10 or 15 or 20 buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7826.209s">And</a> we would cripple that entire side of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7828.69s">We</a> would change the dynamic. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7831.271s">My</a> parents have lived in that neighborhood for more than 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7834.172s">It's</a> a heavy owner-occupied neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7836.553s">I</a> live on another side that's also heavily owner-occupied. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7840.774s">More</a> than 80% of Medford is owner-occupied. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7843.904s">Shifting</a> to more buildings where people are not coming out and talking to their neighbors is really not what Medford is about. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7851.133s">And</a> we really need to be cognizant of whether our quality of life is more important than just adding more buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7857.7s">Because</a> when you add more buildings, they don't just drop tax money off at the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7861.565s">They</a> come with infrastructure needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7863.167s">They</a> come with costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7864.735s">And</a> do those costs exceed the tax money that we get? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7868.418s">Because</a> I know it looks great when it said, look, we got this much more tax money this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7872.241s">But</a> we really have to factor in our infrastructure costs as we see that we're short police and we're short fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7878.686s">And</a> I don't believe that these additional tax revenues that we're getting from the Lumiere's or the, I don't even want to say, but the Locust Street that hopefully will never happen, will not exceed the costs that they will add to our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7891.916s">They'll</a> diminish our quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7894.3s">And</a> we really need to think about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7896.201s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8694.949s">No,</a> that's totally fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8695.989s">I</a> can do it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8697.37s">I'm</a> Cheryl Rodriguez at 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8701.392s">And</a> yes, I tried not to say exactly what I was going to say for the petition when I came up earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8706.034s">But</a> before I begin, a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8708.675s">I</a> noticed that Councilor Falco wants to slow down and wait for a consultant. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8718.658s">Or</a> no, actually, Councilor Scarpelli slowed slow down. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8721.203s">You</a> said to get a consultant. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8724.129s">And</a> Councilor Scarpelli said to slow down and get the mayor's opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8727.916s">Unfortunately,</a> that doesn't help me. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8730.669s">I</a> wrote it down, it's an exact quote.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8745.854s">You</a> didn't say to get the administration's opinion? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8747.995s">Can</a> we roll the tape back? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8748.815s">Absolutely</a> not. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8749.255s">Because</a> I wrote it down.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8769.249s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8770.05s">So</a> either way, either of those courses is not going to help those of us living in the Salem Street area, because we are currently under siege. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8779.775s">The</a> first apartment building is on the block, and the line behind them is stretching all the way from Haines Square to 93, and it's taking a turn down Fountain Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8790.4s">I</a> can't wait a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8791.722s">I</a> can't wait six months for a consultant to come in and go, wow, are you crazy? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8795.065s">You</a> can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8796.086s">Because</a> there's already going to be six, 10 buildings already approved and ready to go, because it's apartment zoned. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8802.412s">And</a> all they have to do is say, we'll do three stories, and they're good to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8805.636s">Because</a> that's what the zoning says. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8807.217s">This</a> is an emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8808.759s">This</a> needs to happen now. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8810.34s">The</a> Roberts Elementary School currently has 569 children. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8813.701s">And</a> just to put that into perspective, more than 100 of those students are ELL students that require extra services. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8819.804s">So</a> while the schools are built to hold 600 students, they are not built to hold 600 students where 100 of them need extra services in this and 50 of them need extra services in that, because those are extra spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8831.568s">So</a> this is extremely important to me as I have a third grader in that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8836.99s">and</a> the largest third grade in the entire city at five classes and more than 100 students, just in the third grade, not including the ELL, not including the inclusion classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8846.695s">So</a> this is very important to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8849.416s">This</a> is very personal. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8852.386s">but</a> just to get back. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8854.207s">So</a> I think that we really need to consider this before we think about waiting for a consultant. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8858.389s">This</a> is one of the most important things that the city council's in charge of is zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8862.191s">And</a> when zoning is going well, zoning is virtually invisible. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8864.912s">For</a> years, the zoning in Medford was virtually invisible. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8868.174s">A</a> lot of people went in and they got their decks and they added their extra parking spaces, but all of a sudden, some developers noticed a hole and they came in and they're trying to fill us in. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8878.459s">And</a> so now we're paying attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8883.35s">So</a> we need to look realistically at what these neighborhoods can handle. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8886.991s">When</a> we saw the traffic loads at the meeting that I attended for Salem Street, they recorded more than 1,000 cars per hour going down Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8894.854s">Think</a> about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8895.494s">That's</a> a lot of cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8897.955s">A</a> lot of times that traffic is backed up. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8900.415s">I</a> tried to get to Haines Square over the weekend and the traffic was backed up almost to the Rotary at 93 on just a random Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8909.463s">The</a> zoning there calls for apartment buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8911.444s">Those</a> apartment buildings can be three stories high and probably between 12 to 15 units. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8917.549s">Imagine</a> them on every plot on Salem Street and the street would just be closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8922.672s">The</a> neighborhood would be decimated. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8925.114s">That</a> is what the zoning intends for that area as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8928.916s">And</a> that may have been true when they created that zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8932.659s">It's</a> no longer true. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8934.36s">It's</a> emergent that this council act to change that zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8939.133s">to</a> a more appropriate scenario. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8942.135s">What</a> that scenario is, I can't say, but I can say that it's not apartments up and down Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8947.94s">We</a> also need to consider the load of those additional residents on our infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8953.344s">Our</a> police and our fire are understaffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8956.246s">Our</a> DPW is understaffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8961.934s">So</a> we really need to consider the quality of life also of people that are living in those areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8966.497s">What</a> are their expectations when they moved in? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8968.819s">Because</a> if you look at Salem Street, most of those buildings are one story. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8973.302s">There</a> are some two family houses mixed in. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8976.624s">There's</a> a couple of apartment buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8979.206s">More</a> of them are closer to 93. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8981.467s">These</a> are not areas that we think of as high concentrated residences. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8988.658s">basically</a> trying to overcrowd this side of the city if we now target this street to suddenly enact the apartment one zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8996.084s">We</a> need to consider, when we keep the zoning, if our infrastructure needs can meet the expanding population that this zoning allows. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9006.492s">I</a> would say no. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9008.533s">We</a> can't support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9010.234s">We're</a> not gonna suddenly be able to add one, five, 10% to our population and <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9018.645s">be</a> able to have enough police and fire to support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9020.746s">We</a> know that it takes several months to train police and fire, but it also takes tax dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9027.189s">While</a> we heard that these new buildings will bring 100,000, or I think Locust Street said they were going to bring a million dollars in new tax revenue, 490 families would bring in an incredible amount of additional needs on the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9043.328s">even</a> if they just had a small 10% children, that's almost 50 children added to the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9049.271s">Can</a> our school system handle that burden? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9051.271s">Can</a> our budget handle the additional costs of those students? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9055.433s">So</a> I urge you to immediately look at all the streets that are zoned apartment one. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9059.815s">Salem</a> Street's not the only street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9061.396s">Fountain</a> Street's not the only street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9063.297s">I'm</a> sure there are pockets in other parts of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9066.318s">My</a> map is pretty hard to read out the street names, so I could only pick out the ones that I recognize. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9073.755s">This</a> is coming and this isn't just something that is going to maybe happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9078.859s">This</a> is something that is actively happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9081.841s">People</a> are watching to see if this project at the old break pro is going to be approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9087.065s">And</a> while it's great to see something different there as opposed to an abandoned building, we have to consider if the street can handle the load of buildings up and down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9097.652s">So</a> I hope that <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9100.478s">you</a> will take this seriously and responsibly try to change this zoning as quickly as possible before it's too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9108.4s">Because</a> once those buildings are constructed and sitting on

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5650.985s">Hi,</a> Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5652.006s">I</a> live at 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5654.287s">I'm</a> glad that we're finally talking about perhaps moving the Board of Appeals meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5657.949s">Because</a> this council has such a heavy burden of maintaining our zoning ordinances, it's really important that you're able to attend these meetings at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5666.354s">So</a> a Wednesday meeting, or perhaps let the board choose a day that works for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5671.497s">The</a> next meeting that will have a large crowd will be the Salem Street Development meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5676.579s">That</a> is already being held on a Wednesday, on March 8. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5679.693s">Perhaps</a> it would be a wonderful time to test out this room, because anyone who's attended any of these ZBA meetings knows that a developer presentation runs in excess of an hour, where they show you pictures of everything from shrubs to fitness equipment to present their entire project from the ground up. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5698.651s">And</a> that room is very small. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5701.153s">Saying</a> that 20 people fit in it is <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5703.706s">is</a> an exaggeration. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5704.666s">It</a> really doesn't fit that many people. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5706.567s">So</a> I'd like to see, since this is probably one of the most important boards in the city as far as shaping the city, these meetings be brought out into the public, be televised, or at least be in a room that's large enough for all of us to know, and perhaps if we can get those agendas online so that people know that these meetings are coming up, because this is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5726.852s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2018-01-22_IxvjbChoNJk/2018-01-22_IxvjbChoNJk.html">Medford, MA School Committee - Jan. 22, 2017 [Livestream] (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1.292s">So</a> today I'm here to ask for support and help for the Roberts PTO's grant application to the Community Preservation Commission for the restoration of our school playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=10.679s">The</a> Roberts Elementary School is one of the most populous elementary schools in Medford and our playground, as are all the elementary school playgrounds, is in need of replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=19.426s">The</a> worst item in all our playgrounds seems to be the surfacing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=22.969s">So</a> I applied for this grant for a few reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=25.751s">One</a> was that I saw the mayor's capital improvement plan at a city council meeting and it included line items to replace one school playground per year, which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=35.056s">And</a> I thought if we coupled it with community preservation money, we could replace two playgrounds per year and everyone could have a new playground in two to three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=44.042s">So</a> that would be about 2,400 students in our elementary schools that would all have a shiny new playground to play in. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=50.615s">So</a> that benefit would radiate out through the neighborhood that each school is in because it will allow their family members of the students to enjoy the playgrounds as well as people that just live in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=61.318s">We've</a> gone through the eligibility phase and we now have to prepare a complete application. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=68.119s">So</a> we don't know exactly how much it's going to cost and we need help from the district in order to <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=74.981s">figure</a> out the parameters of what you'll require, companies that we have to go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=79.404s">This</a> is outside of my scope of expertise as well as my authority as a parent volunteer at the Roberts Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=86.789s">We</a> were able to apply with a supporting letter from the principal at our school. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=91.793s">But</a> in order to go forward, we need approval and help from the school committee and the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=98.238s">So</a> I'm hoping that we're going to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=101.1s">The</a> application needs to be submitted by March 2nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=104.762s">I'm</a> hoping that we'll make it through the first round because that will allow for completion to happen in the summer when the students are not in school so that they won't have any interrupted recess time and they'll be able to start September with a shiny new playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=117.927s">If</a> we do receive community preservation funds, there are other grants that we can apply for to help supplement, but we're not eligible to apply for those grants until we receive funding from the community preservation. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=134.047s">I'm</a> hoping that you guys can help me out. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=135.848s">That's</a> pretty much why I'm here.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3443.536s">Hi,</a> I'm Cheryl Rodriguez again, 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3446.597s">I</a> am an active member of my PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3449.359s">No</a> one personally approached me, but I can tell you that my PTO sends constant flyers. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3455.581s">They</a> have events almost monthly. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3457.822s">Every</a> PTO does this. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3459.243s">We</a> have Facebook pages. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3461.204s">Some</a> of us have Twitter accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3463.585s">We</a> make every effort to have people join. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3466.086s">I'm</a> not a board member on a PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3467.907s">I</a> went to a PTO meeting and I <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3470.708s">raised</a> my hand and volunteered, I've added programming to my PTO on a voluntary basis and people do the best that they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3479.518s">I've</a> gone to meetings where there's been three people and I know for a fact that a flyer's gone out, that a flyer's been on the window at the school, that we've posted it on our Facebook page and there's three people there. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3491.271s">And</a> that's not because we're not engaging our community, because we have signs up at every event that things are going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3497.014s">We</a> send out emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3498.795s">There's</a> only so much that you can do, but you have to be realistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3502.176s">When</a> I had my first child, I worked full time and I did not volunteer at the PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3506.218s">I</a> did not have the time or the bandwidth. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3508.279s">I'm</a> lucky now that I can and I do, and I appreciate that a lot of people are not able to do that, and I don't think that we should be disparaging people on either side. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3517.689s">People</a> that do have the time to volunteer, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3519.832s">People</a> that don't, you know, that's fine too. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3522.535s">We're</a> here for all of the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3524.136s">We</a> do fundraising for every child. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3527.079s">all</a> the schools and we're not singling out and go oh Johnny's mother didn't help so he doesn't get a t-shirt on field day. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3532.761s">So</a> I think we need to remember that and I hope that some of your recommendations will include ways to help some of our PTOs. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3539.383s">Especially</a> those of us that are in high needs districts, high needs areas where our parents do work two jobs or our parents don't speak English. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3548.086s">are</a> they have special needs children they have to attend to or they have three or four children and packing those kids up and coming to a PTO meeting is impossible. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3556.036s">We</a> even tried to do our meetings on Facebook live and it didn't it didn't increase our attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3562.243s">So</a> we're all doing the best that we can and I hope that <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3565.787s">The</a> district is able to help us because from year to year, some PTOs find that it's really hard for them to afford that $8,000 to $10,000 that we need for the buses or that field day event or that in-school enrichment and we do the best that we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3579.513s">Sometimes</a> you run a fundraiser and you think you're going to make $1,000 and you make $500 and you have to add another fundraiser on the fly because you're not going to cover those bills at the end of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3589.578s">Thanks.</a> <h2><a href="../2016-11-23_iQlaYxPzzdE/2016-11-23_iQlaYxPzzdE.html">Medford School Committee meeting November 21, 2016</a></h2>

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5065.415s">I'm</a> also hoping that if they wish to get out of the crossing guard business, that maybe we'll consider getting in the crossing guard business.<h2><a href="../2016-11-10_FmrA4M646Vo/2016-11-10_FmrA4M646Vo.html">Medford School Committee meeting November 7, 2016</a></h2>

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4696.954s">Hi,</a> I'm Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4700.215s">Um,</a> I spoke at the podium last week about the issue that I, I started to speak about the issue that I had at the community meeting and I was interrupted and everyone that I ran into from Medford this week said, wow, I can't believe that that happened at the city council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4717.078s">So</a> I did some research and found out that in the Roberts Rules of Order, I shouldn't have been interrupted because I had the right to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4724.624s">I</a> wasn't speaking, saying anything inflammatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4727.506s">I</a> was sharing my experience from having gone to that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4731.389s">And</a> so I wanted to come up and say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4735.271s">And</a> I also wanted to share the information that I had from the meeting because I felt that I didn't really get to share it last time because of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4743.373s">One</a> other interesting thing I found out when I was researching the Roberts Rules of Order was that a point of information is when you have a question for the speaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4749.919s">It's</a> not actually to give information. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4752.081s">I</a> was pretty surprised about that, but when I spoke to my 20-year-old college student who is on the student government at her college, she said, of course, mom, everybody knows that, because she had to take a crash course in Roberts Rules of Law in order to be on student government. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4768.544s">I</a> was pretty thrown off when I was interrupted for several minutes, so I just wanted to go back. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4773.908s">When</a> I saw the Facebook post about the meeting being in the neighborhoods, I wanted to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4778.911s">I</a> came straight from the South Medford Economic Transition meeting to that meeting, so I missed the five-minute introduction. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4786.316s">I</a> was sitting in the back of the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4788.277s">The</a> Brooks parents had a very large showing, and I sat for the first hour and heard them discuss their issues on High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4797.632s">After</a> that point, I raised my hand so that I could have an opportunity to speak as everyone else in the room was doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4803.622s">I</a> had my hand up for several minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4805.786s">I</a> swapped my hands back and forth as my arms got tired from being held up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4809.958s">Someone</a> came up behind me and told me to stand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4812.539s">Perhaps</a> he couldn't see me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4813.719s">I</a> did stand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4815.059s">Someone</a> I knew across the room waved at me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4816.92s">I</a> waved my arm. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4817.82s">I</a> still wasn't called on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4820.321s">Three</a> people around me, I actually leaned over and said to Councilor Falco, I think that perhaps they don't want to call on me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4829.589s">And</a> I kept my hand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4831.631s">Three</a> people around me raised their hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4833.972s">They</a> were each called on fairly quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4836.234s">Each</a> said, I just raised my hand so that she could have a turn to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4840.617s">So</a> I did not feel welcome at that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4843.76s">It's</a> pretty known that I live in East Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4848.372s">Maybe</a> that was or was not the reason that I wasn't called on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4852.275s">The</a> only thing that I wished to say at that meeting was what I say when I come here, is that traffic is an issue everywhere in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4859.741s">There</a> are dangerous conditions in other parts of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4863.064s">What</a> they were stressing at that meeting was calling in the mass DOT to meet about High Street, and I wanted to interject that if we were going to have them come down, they would only come down once. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4874.113s">And</a> we should identify all the other mass DOT streets that we have within Medford that have issues and have them all tour those streets at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4884.157s">Because</a> if you go to any school and talk to the parents, they'll all tell you a horror story about a street nearby. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4889.959s">If</a> you go to the senior center, they'll tell you a similar story. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4893.92s">So</a> I wanted to make sure that we got the best that we could for all of Medford, and that was my point speaking then. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4901.382s">At</a> that meeting, we were instructed if we wanted to see accidents, I'm almost done, that we could go on the Mass Highway website and find traffic data. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4909.549s">So</a> the latest data that I could find was from 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4913.032s">I</a> didn't include any Wellington Circle 93 or the <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4917.3s">Rotary</a> that's right out here, I'm not sure the name of it, just because those are things we really can't fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4923.242s">But</a> the big winner, or maybe the loser, depending on how you want to look at it, was Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4928.023s">Main</a> Street had the most accidents, by far, of any other street in our city in 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4932.344s">They</a> had 87 accidents, which I thought was wow. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4936.525s">I</a> haven't heard anybody come in and complain about accidents on Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4940.146s">Salem</a> Street was at 62. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4942.007s">High</a> Street was at 50. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4942.907s">I</a> included the entirety of these streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4946.028s">The</a> Fellsway was at 34. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4947.589s">Riverside,</a> 32. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4949.09s">Boston</a> Ave, 27. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4950.752s">Middlesex</a> Ave, 24. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4952.773s">The</a> Winthrop Circle, the infamous Winthrop Circle, was at 17. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4957.357s">And</a> Locust Street, where we want to put 490 units as well as Wegman, had 14 accidents. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4962.981s">That's</a> a very short strip of street to have 14 accidents in one year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4968.755s">Central</a> lab at the intersection of spring also had 10 accidents that year So I just wanted to point out that there's a lot of issues in the city I know that the police are short-staffed and I know that we're looking to make changes to the infrastructure and that we want to hire someone but Sometimes if you just look at the data and you talk to everyone then you can find out I hope that a lot of people will come to the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4990.748s">I'm</a> not sure the date of the meeting I <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4996.722s">The</a> first Wednesday of the month, November 5th, according to Councilor Falco, and that will be at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=5000.703s">Francis.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=5003.464s">So</a> I encourage everyone to attend and make sure that the city knows everything that's going on because there are a lot of issues and we can't just be quiet and hope that someone will notice and fix them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=5013.267s">So</a> that's all that I can say. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=5014.908s">Thank</a> you for your time.<h2><a

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7184.584s">Hi,</a> I'm Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7185.885s">I</a> live at 281 Park Street, and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7188.507s">Caldwell</a> mentioned that we are applying for several grants this year for different enrichment for the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7194.612s">Those</a> grants don't usually cover the entire event, so this Saturday from 9 to 3, the Roberts Elementary School will be holding a yard sale to try to cover the cost of the rest of these events. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7206.678s">It's</a> estimated now that we have three U-Hauls worth of items, and every dollar that we raise will go directly to enrichment for our nearly 600 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7214.343s">So</a> if anyone can come, we're right down on Park Street.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7218.306s">It's</a> from 9 to 3 this Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7220.587s">Thank</a> you, Cheryl. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7222.449s">I</a> saw a lot of it on our porch. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7223.809s">It</a> all looks good.<h2><a href="../2025-03-18_xPBP-EonBGI/2025-03-18_xPBP-EonBGI.html">Medford, MA City Council - Oct. 11, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2795.185s">Hi,</a> my name is Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2796.665s">I</a> live at 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2798.726s">I</a> attended the meeting at the Brooks School. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2803.918s">This</a> is basically, this meeting started from a Facebook post, which seems to be our new way of doing things in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2810.861s">And</a> every parent in this city who's on Medford bombs knows that every September starts with, my child was trying to go to the school bus and almost got killed. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2820.245s">The</a> first one posted was on the Fellsway. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2823.106s">Didn't</a> get much traction. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2824.347s">The</a> parents said, yeah, that's happened to me a million times and nothing happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2828.608s">The</a> one that happened on High Street got more traction. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2831.672s">They</a> have a fabulous organization in West Medford that can really rally people to show up in a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2837.613s">And</a> boy, am I jealous. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2839.835s">I</a> wish I could have 70 people standing behind me today talking about the problems that we have on my side of the city, on other parts of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2847.342s">But</a> the one thing that I got out of that meeting was one of the officers suggested that I go on to the mass.gov website. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2854.569s">He</a> suggested that we all go on and that we could get a copy of all the accidents in the city of Medford for the past three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2861.695s">So</a> I went on this morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2862.956s">I</a> clicked it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2864.057s">Within</a> five minutes, I had an email that had three years of accident statistics from Medford by date, had the intersections and everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2873.704s">I</a> can tell you that the hottest spots are not surprising to anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2877.627s">The</a> Fellsway, Salem Street, Locust Street, I was a little bit surprised. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2882.331s">A</a> lot of accidents on Locust Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2883.852s">Spring</a> Street is a big hot issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2885.713s">Anyone</a> on Medford Moms knows that people are getting hit over there constantly. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2891.903s">What</a> else was it? <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2893.685s">Mystic</a> Ave wasn't too bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2895.406s">High</a> Street had a lot of accidents as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2897.528s">The</a> Winthrop Street Circle had accidents. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2899.609s">There's</a> a lot of hotspots in the city that are not just on High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2904.233s">I</a> mean, I applaud that we had a meeting specifically for High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2907.896s">I'm</a> not sure all the other neighborhoods should have to wait the several months for their meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2912.159s">What</a> if there were more issues on High Street? <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2914.081s">Are</a> they not allowed to go to the community meeting because it's supposed to be focused only on their neighborhood? <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2919.345s">Because</a> that's what's going around.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3095.517s">Thank</a> you for making that clear, because I did attend that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3098.118s">I</a> was late. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3098.558s">I</a> was at the South Medford Economic Development meeting, which I had to leave in the middle of the mayor's remarks to come to that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3105.6s">But</a> I did attend the meeting with that frame of mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3111.502s">I've</a> since been told by others that they thought it was inappropriate to speak of anywhere but their neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3117.804s">So</a> I hope that people heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3119.938s">that</a> this is supposed to be community-wide. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3122.379s">And</a> I hope that at the end of all these meetings that there'll be resolutions about all of these streets and all the neighborhoods, because I did speak about the Fellsway, which I'm sure you're familiar with the Fellsway. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3133.423s">We</a> don't have a crossing guard at all, but I see a resolution on here to add an additional crossing guard to another street. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3139.385s">So</a> I'm not sure how many months people are gonna have to wait before they're gonna see this kind of rapid action. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3145.967s">I</a> mean, 4 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3146.968s">street</a> lining. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3148.528s">and</a> lights being ordered and grant money coming in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3152.091s">I</a> think we need to look at all these streets and we need to look at them quickly and not wait four or six months to get to other neighborhood meetings because there's danger now in other areas of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3163.181s">And</a> I think we're hyper-focused on one street and I hope that that is not going to continue to be the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3169.987s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2016-10-11_9tYE20_LxA4/2016-10-11_9tYE20_LxA4.html">Medford School Committee September 26, 2016</a></h2>
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=435.549s">Name</a> and address, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=436.829s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=437.029s">I'm</a> Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=438.63s">My</a> address is 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=442.118s">I</a> prepared a statement because I want to make sure that I get everything I want to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=447.802s">So</a> my daughter is a third grade student at the Roberts Elementary. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=451.024s">I'm</a> an active parent at that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=453.346s">I</a> appeared before this body in the spring to request funds for our mosaic mural. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=457.648s">I</a> helped run some of the enrichment nights at the school and the after school enrichment program for the PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=463.212s">So</a> I'm very invested in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=465.974s">At</a> the last school committee meeting, there were questions about the classes at the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=471.16s">And</a> a comment was made that Mr. Johnson distributed his special needs students differently than other schools and no one knew why. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=479.886s">So</a> I wanted to explain a little bit and ask for some help from this group. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=484.79s">The</a> Roberts Elementary has the highest enrollment of all the elementary schools in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=489.333s">It</a> also houses the welcome program for the English language learners, meaning those with no English skills, and our autism program. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=496.48s">These</a> are two very large programs, 92 and 75, respectively, as of September 16th, but these numbers are constantly changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=504.365s">To</a> put that into perspective, it is divided equally by grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=507.167s">We</a> would have 15.3 ELL students per grade and 12.5 autistic children per grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=510.049s">So</a> 17% ELL and 14% autistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=510.95s">We</a> also have 51% low income. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=520.275s">On</a> September 9th, our total population was reported at 547, but as of September 16th, it had already climbed to 555 and is perhaps even higher now. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=530.844s">Conversely,</a> the Brooks Elementary has 449. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=534.847s">It</a> was noted at the last meeting that the two middle schools, the one that housed the ELL population was deliberately kept smaller as new students enter the program constantly. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=544.114s">The</a> same is true at the Roberts, but we do not have the buffer of being the smallest elementary school or the largest. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=549.75s">Our</a> ELL students are taken out of class to receive specialized services to help them to learn English, so they are grouped in the same class in order to accommodate scheduling. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=558.621s">Imagine</a> trying to keep five third grade classes on identical schedules to pull ELL students out of each one. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=566.743s">Our</a> higher needs autism students are also placed together because some of them share an aid. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=571.445s">It</a> was made pretty clear at budget time that there's no appetite on this committee to have an aid in each class. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=577.388s">I</a> do think that this process needs a deeper look. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=581.128s">My</a> daughter has found herself in the autism inclusion class this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=584.972s">I</a> understand that there are some in the other classes, but there are higher needs students in her class. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=589.958s">The</a> children at the Roberts are the most empathetic children that you will ever meet, but the things my daughter has been exposed to since school started at this class has given me pause. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=600.07s">Something</a> must be done for these children. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=602.795s">The</a> teacher and aide in this class have been hit, furniture has been thrown, the classroom has been evacuated, and children have been physically restrained on almost a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=612.742s">Who</a> is benefiting from this? <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=614.603s">Not</a> the special needs children forced into a mainstream setting that is clearly overwhelming, not the quote standard students who are witnessing these events. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=622.749s">None</a> of them are receiving an appropriate education as all learning must cease when one of these episodes begin. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=629.35s">But</a> when I tried to discuss the wild stories that my child was coming home with, I hit a wall of privacy issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=635.131s">If</a> my child, any child, is being exposed to incidences that are traumatic and are violent in nature, the parents need to be notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=643.313s">Parents</a> should not hear these stories from their children and hear nothing from the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=649.394s">We</a> want to help our children to process what is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=652.014s">We</a> are empathetic to all of the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=654.215s">All</a> of the children in this situation needs help. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=657.558s">Is</a> this unique to my child's class? <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=659.72s">I</a> think no. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=660.441s">Is</a> this an appropriate setting for any of these children? <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=663.544s">Absolutely</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=665.486s">It</a> is time that we stop acting as if the population of the Roberts is the same as at the other schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=671.372s">Our</a> school houses two high needs groups and the largest child population in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=676.617s">One</a> of these programs should be shifted to a school with a lower population. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=680.508s">If</a> our class sizes were closer to the 15 to 16 mark that some of the elementary schools have, we would be able to have smaller classes for our autistic population. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=689.894s">We</a> could easily bring their class size down to 8 to 10 with no negative impact on any other classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=696.317s">But</a> as it stands, in order to try and bring a second grade class total <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=701.095s">Down</a> from the 22 average for the autism emerging class, we were forced to have one class have a total of 24 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=709.138s">As</a> a comparison, the second grade class at the Brooks has an average of 17.25. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=715.18s">My</a> daughter is in grade three, which has five classrooms and an average class size of 19.8. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=722.482s">Across</a> town, the Brooks has four third grade classes with an average class size of 17.5. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=729.102s">This</a> population difference will only intensify when some of the 800 plus units permanent or under construction for the Robertson McGlynn Elementary School begin to hold residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=739.03s">The</a> needs of all the children need to be considered. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=741.292s">I</a> care about all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=743.214s">I</a> work with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=744.535s">So</a> I'm floored by the natural and easy way that they take care of each other and I'm asking the school department to step in and help them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=751.754s">My</a> own daughter is suffering greatly as a result of her exposure in these classes, and I'm still finding out what she's witnessed in small pieces. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=759.177s">She's</a> confided in my parents, in the parents of some of her friends, and some in my husband and I. The first thing she told me was that she was worried for the children that were having the incidents. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=769.781s">The</a> second thing she told me was that she was afraid. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=772.562s">No</a> child should be afraid to go to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=776.428s">Upon</a> hearing that, I started a crusade to help my child and the other children in her class or classes like hers. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=781.531s">I</a> spoke to the teacher who directed me to the principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=784.112s">I</a> spoke to the principal, and other than the incident that required a student to leave by ambulance, he had heard of no other incidences, nor had the school department, nor the special needs department. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=795.376s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=795.636s">I</a> suspect it is because nothing will come of reporting it, but despite my reporting it, nothing has come of it yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=803.388s">The</a> adjustment Councilor at the school has not even spoken to the children about the incident that was reported and happened a week ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=810.04s">an</a> incident that required an ambulance to remove a student from the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=813.862s">The</a> parents have not been notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=815.963s">What</a> is the protocol? <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=817.403s">What</a> measures are in place to help these autistic children who are suffering or the other students? <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=822.525s">My</a> daughter is refusing to go back into that classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=825.667s">We</a> have been attempting to help her cope with what she has witnessed almost daily. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=829.889s">She</a> has been having migraine headaches. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=831.89s">She's</a> extremely anxious. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=833.43s">This</a> weekend, she had a panic attack, thinking about having to go back to class. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=838.306s">She</a> reports that her teachers have assured her that they will keep the children safe and they neither need to worry nor be afraid because they will worry and be afraid for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=848.454s">My</a> daughter's takeaway from that statement is that the incidents will continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=852.818s">That</a> there will still be danger and that she's just supposed to ignore it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=857.162s">So</a> please help us. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=859.13s">I</a> understand that there's privacy issues, but something has to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=862.412s">The</a> teachers in Mr. Johnson are doing the best that they can with the tools available to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=867.015s">They</a> need more tools. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=868.756s">They</a> need a smaller population so they can adjust class sizes to accommodate the high needs of our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=874.219s">We</a> can't only worry about my one child, but I am worried about my child. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=879.382s">We</a> need to worry about all of the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=881.403s">The</a> needs of all the children are not identical.

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2688.307s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2689.468s">I</a> just wanted to clarify. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2691.876s">something</a> about the incidences. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2693.796s">The</a> latest and largest incident was last Monday. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2696.357s">It</a> occurred in the cafeteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2698.078s">There</a> were several incidences before and after. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2702.819s">And</a> we never got notified of any of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2704.799s">So</a> the reason that I came forward and started speaking to people was because of the larger incident that had happened in the cafeteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2711.101s">But</a> as I went through and spoke to the principal, and I spoke to Diane Caldwell, and I spoke to someone in the special needs department, and I spoke to Mr. Belson, and no one <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2720.263s">had</a> heard of any of the incidents other than the one that had happened in the cafeteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2725.045s">So</a> that's really concerning to me that these issues, maybe they don't know how to report them, who to report them, because these issues hadn't gone beyond the classroom or the safety team. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2735.23s">No</a> one else was aware of these instances, which is why I'm saying we really need to look at what's going on for the protocol and what we should do.<h2><a href="../2016-10-07_3G6bVVGWEWQ/2016-10-07_3G6bVVGWEWQ.html">PART 1 Medford School Committee September 26, 2016 meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=435.522s">Name</a> and address, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=436.823s">Hi,</a> I'm Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=438.624s">My</a> address is 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=442.105s">I</a> prepared a statement because I want to make sure that I get everything that I want to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=447.788s">So</a> my daughter is a third grade student at the Roberts Elementary. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=450.99s">I'm</a> an active parent at that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=453.311s">I</a> appeared before this body in the spring to request funds for our mosaic mural. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=457.633s">I</a> helped run some of the enrichment nights at the school and the after school enrichment program for the PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=463.176s">So</a> I'm very invested in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=465.937s">At</a> the last school committee meeting, there were questions about the classes at the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=471.143s">And</a> a comment was made that Mr. Johnson distributed his special needs students differently than other schools and no one knew why. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=479.868s">So</a> I wanted to explain a little bit and ask for some help from this group. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=484.751s">The</a> Roberts Elementary has the highest enrollment of all the elementary schools in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=489.293s">It</a> also houses the welcome program for the English language learners, meaning those with no English skills, and our autism program. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=496.463s">These</a> are two very large programs, 92 and 75 respectively as of September 16th, but these numbers are constantly changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=504.347s">To</a> put that into perspective, it is divided equally by grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=507.148s">We</a> would have 15.3 ELL students per grade and 12.5 autistic children per grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=510.029s">So</a> 17% ELL and 14% autistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=510.93s">We</a> also have 51% low income. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=520.242s">On</a> September 9th, our total population was reported at 547, but as of September 16th, it had already climbed to 555 and is perhaps even higher now. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=530.825s">Conversely,</a> the Brooks Elementary has 449. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=533.766s">It</a> was noted at the last meeting that the two middle schools, the one that housed the ELL population was deliberately kept smaller as new students enter the program constantly. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=544.069s">The</a> same is true at the Roberts, but we do not have the buffer of being the smallest elementary school or the largest. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=549.713s">Our</a> ELL students are taken out of class to receive specialized services to help them to learn English, so they are grouped in the same class in order to accommodate scheduling. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=558.6s">Imagine</a> trying to keep five third grade classes on identical schedules to pull ELL students out of each one. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=566.726s">Our</a> higher needs autism students are also placed together because some of them share an aid. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=571.429s">It</a> was made pretty clear at budget time that there's no appetite on this committee to have an aid in each class. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=577.352s">I</a> do think that this process needs a deeper look. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=581.115s">My</a> daughter has found herself in the autism inclusion class this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=584.957s">I</a> understand that there are some in the other classes, but there are higher needs students in her class. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=589.94s">The</a> children at the Roberts are the most empathetic children that you will ever meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=594.206s">But</a> the things my daughter has been exposed to since school started at this class has given me pause. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=600.032s">Something</a> must be done for these children. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=602.774s">The</a> teacher and aide in this class have been hit, furniture has been thrown, the classroom has been evacuated, and children have been physically restrained on almost a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=612.744s">Who</a> is benefiting from this? <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=614.606s">Not</a> the special needs children forced into a mainstream setting that is clearly overwhelming, <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=619.167s">not</a> the, quote, standard students who are witnessing these events. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=622.708s">None</a> of them are receiving an appropriate education, as all learning must cease when one of these episodes begin. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=629.33s">But</a> when I tried to discuss the wild stories that my child was coming home with, I hit a wall of privacy issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=635.111s">If</a> my child, any child, is being exposed to incidences that are traumatic and are violent in nature, the parents need to be notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=643.314s">Parents</a> should not hear these stories from their children and hear nothing from the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=649.37s">We</a> want to help our children to process what is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=651.972s">We</a> are empathetic to all of the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=654.193s">All</a> the children in this situation need help. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=657.535s">Is</a> this unique to my child's class? <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=659.697s">I</a> think no. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=660.437s">Is</a> this an appropriate setting for any of these children? <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=663.519s">Absolutely</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=665.455s">It</a> is time that we stop acting as if the population of the Roberts as the same as at the other schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=671.338s">Our</a> school houses two high needs groups and the largest child population in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=676.581s">One</a> of these programs should be shifted to a school with a lower population. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=680.491s">If</a> our class sizes were closer to the 15 to 16 mark that some of the elementary schools have, we would be able to have smaller classes for our autistic population. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=689.877s">We</a> could easily bring their class size down to eight to 10 with no negative impact on any other classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=696.302s">But</a> as it stands, in order to try and bring a second grade class total down from the 22 average for the autism emerging class, we were forced to have one class have a total of 24 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=709.114s">As</a> a comparison, the second grade class at the Brooks has an average of 17.25. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=715.158s">My</a> daughter is in grade three, which has five classrooms and an average class size of 19.8. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=722.462s">Across</a> town, the Brooks has four third grade classes with an average class size of 17.5. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=729.106s">This</a> population difference will only intensify when some of the 800 plus units permanent or under construction for the Roberts and McGlynn Elementary School begin to hold residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=738.99s">The</a> needs of all the children need to be considered. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=741.271s">I</a> care about all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=743.191s">I</a> work with them, so I'm floored by the natural and easy way that they take care of each other, and I'm asking the school department to step in and help them. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=751.733s">My</a> own daughter is suffering greatly as a result of her exposure in these classes, and I'm still finding out what she's witnessed in small pieces. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=759.155s">She's</a> confided in my parents, in the parents of some of her friends, and some in my husband and I. The first thing she told me <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=766.736s">was</a> that she was worried for the children that were having the incidents. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=769.758s">The</a> second thing she told me was that she was afraid. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=772.539s">No</a> child should be afraid to go to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=776.401s">Upon</a> hearing that, I started a crusade to help my child and the other children in her class or classes like hers. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=781.524s">I</a> spoke to the teacher who directed me to the principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=784.085s">I</a> spoke to the principal, and other than the incident that required a student to leave by ambulance, he had heard of no other incidences, nor had the school department, nor the special needs department. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=795.362s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=795.622s">I</a> suspect it is because nothing will come of reporting it, but despite my reporting it, nothing has come of it yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=803.368s">The</a> adjustment Councilor at the school has not even spoken to the children about the incident that was reported and happened a week ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=810.027s">An</a> incident that required an ambulance to remove a student from the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=813.848s">The</a> parents have not been notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=815.928s">What</a> is the protocol? <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=817.388s">What</a> measures are in place to help these autistic children who are suffering or the other students? <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=822.489s">My</a> daughter is refusing to go back into that classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=825.63s">We</a> have been attempting to help her cope with what she has witnessed almost daily. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=829.871s">She</a> has been having migraine headaches. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=831.871s">She's</a> extremely anxious. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=833.411s">This</a> weekend, she had a panic attack thinking about having to go back to class. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=838.289s">She</a> reports that her teachers have assured her that they will keep the children safe and they neither need to worry nor be afraid because they will worry and be afraid for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=848.433s">My</a> daughter's takeaway from that statement is that the incidents will continue, that there will still be danger and that she's just supposed to ignore it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=857.137s">So</a> please help us. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=859.113s">I</a> understand that there's privacy issues, but something has to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=862.395s">The</a> teachers and Mr. Johnson are doing the best that they can with the tools available to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=866.977s">They</a> need more tools. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=868.738s">They</a> need a smaller population so they can adjust class sizes to accommodate the high needs of our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=874.2s">We</a> can't only worry about my one child, but I am worried about my child. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=879.363s">We</a> need to worry about all of the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=881.384s">The</a> needs of all the children are not identical.

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8288.999s">Hi,</a> I'm Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8290.159s">I</a> live at 281 Park Street, and I saw this item on the agenda, and in the past couple of months, I've posted a couple of graffiti incidents that happened at the Roberts School. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8302.124s">So</a> I posted for two months, someone had written on the side of the school, and the complaint wasn't acknowledged. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8307.546s">Finally,</a> this past week, a private citizen messaged me and told me that they had gone down to the school with a bucket and water and a scrub brush and cleaned the graffiti off the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8319.5s">which</a> thank you very much for cleaning the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8322.264s">I</a> don't think he should have had to but I appreciate that he did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8325.148s">There's</a> also a pedestrian crossing sign at the school that has had graffiti on it and the bottom rivet is not connected and that's been there for about two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8332.696s">I</a> know several parents have called and complained about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8335.759s">So</a> our DPW, I know, is short-staffed and they really are not able to handle this overflow. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8341.345s">So</a> I think the graffiti issue in the city is probably more of a symptom. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8345.569s">I</a> can also cite an example of businesses on Spring Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8348.653s">I</a> drove down Spring Street and there was someone had written their name about 40 or 50 times on one building on Spring Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8355.988s">And</a> I drove down less than a week later, and the owner had painted over all of it, but that person had graffitied over what he had already painted. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8364.232s">So</a> in the span of a week, he had already painted the entire building. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8369.434s">They</a> wrapped around the entire side of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8371.455s">It</a> was about a foot high, about 40 times. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8374.217s">He</a> signed his name, maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8377.513s">We</a> can find him. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8378.453s">His</a> name's on the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8380.754s">So</a> that's pretty upsetting that the owner was out there that quickly and repaired the damage and then it was done to him again. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8388.897s">Again,</a> this is probably a symptom of a larger issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8391.038s">I</a> know that the police force is down, density is up, and there's less patrol. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8395.959s">So</a> this is a symptom and something that we really need to think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8399.941s">Do</a> we need more DPW? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8401.281s">Do</a> we need more police? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8404.674s">is</a> just a small level crime, but it is something to think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8407.615s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10642.292s">I</a> live at 281 Park Street and I encourage a moratorium on building because sorry right now there are over 800 units that are approved and either under construction or or pending permits and <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10657.382s">And</a> they're all on the side of the city where the McGlynn and the Roberts are. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10662.044s">The</a> McGlynn and the Roberts are the most highly populated schools in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10665.785s">I</a> met with the principal at the Roberts on Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10668.246s">The</a> numbers that he had given to the school committee were 547. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10670.427s">He's</a> now, as of Friday, he was up to 555. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10676.149s">He</a> gets new students almost daily. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10679.07s">That</a> school is very full. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10681.317s">The</a> McGlynn School is at 495. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10683.699s">If</a> you go across town, you'll see the Columbus is at 401, the Brooks is at 449. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10688.643s">So</a> the school populations do need to be considered in approving building projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10694.107s">If</a> 10% of these new units have one child, that's 80 new children, that will go to the Roberts or the Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10703.294s">Schools</a> that, I mean the Roberts or the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10705.356s">Schools</a> that are already having a challenge <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10709.131s">That's</a> the last school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10710.192s">We</a> have you know a second grade class at the Roberts that has 24 students in it So that this these are things that are not considered when the zoning board approves things they don't contact the school department and I <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10724.518s">We're</a> all have hanging over our head Locust Street, which is 490 units being built on six and a half acres. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10731.582s">If</a> you look at every city that surrounds Medford that is opposing a building project right now, those projects are all on 12, 14, 18 acres of land and slightly over 300. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10742.507s">They</a> were all denied as too dense. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10745.509s">But</a> we approved 490 units on six and a half acres with residents standing up and screaming no. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10754.982s">They</a> just pulled the Salem Street development, which he wants 25 units on 18,000 square feet, which is, I think, 100 feet from the Roberts Elementary School, and he wants to put 27 parking spaces, but he's withdrawing because he's waiting because we all heard about the possibility of 40R. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10773.865s">I</a> just got the schedule for the Zoning Board of Appeals meeting next week, and someone on Main Street wants to tear down, it's either a one or a two-family house, and put up 12 units. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10784.498s">The</a> meeting that I attended in June, they had someone who wanted to tear down a single-family house and put up a seven-family. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10791.584s">So</a> even if you put a moratorium on 25, taking one family and turning it into seven or 10 or 12 is exploding our population. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10803.153s">I</a> went to the Traffic Commission meeting last week, and the people are in saying, you know, I live next door to a two-family house. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10808.838s">They</a> have 15 cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10810.479s">They</a> have no parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10811.776s">They're</a> all in the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10812.797s">I</a> think they're running a rooming house. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10814.718s">So</a> density is being increased constantly, and this is something that we need to consider as we're approving things like turning a one family into a two, turning a one family into a seven, building another unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10827.526s">So</a> we really need to stop, because whatever zoning laws are in place, they're not being followed. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10835.632s">Variances</a> are being given out very easily. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10841.829s">save</a> the city, save the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10843.749s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_L9vF4yM-fUc/2025-03-21_L9vF4yM-fUc.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 28, 2016 (Unofficially

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5807.837s">Hi,</a> I'm Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5811.32s">I</a> live at 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5815.022s">I</a> was the subject of the meeting this morning for the complaint. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5818.978s">If</a> anyone doesn't know yet, I think everyone knows, but I attended that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5823.879s">There</a> were more than a dozen residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5825.92s">Every</a> seat in that room was full. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5828.461s">And</a> the abutters were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5830.161s">They're</a> here tonight again. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5831.241s">I</a> recognize them. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5832.322s">All</a> stood up and said what address they lived on on Cumming Street and that they were opposed to this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5838.303s">At</a> approximately 10.30, Chairman Arena said, we have over 1,000 pages of documentation to review. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5845.7s">and</a> we will be taking this matter under advisement. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5848.342s">At</a> that point, all the citizens and the attorneys, the entire Equity One Army, they brought almost as many people as we had, about 15 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5858.597s">Rose</a> exited the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5861.319s">No</a> words were spoken by anyone on this board until the room was cleared. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5866.202s">We</a> were in the hallway, and Dennis McDool, I guess their secretary, came, closed the door, and said, we have much to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5874.248s">We</a> were not invited into the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5875.809s">We</a> did not know what was happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5878.41s">I</a> am not an attorney, as Chairman Arena told me this morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5882.613s">I</a> knew, but he reminded me. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5884.555s">So</a> I don't know all the rules of open meeting laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5886.676s">When</a> someone closes a door and says we have much to discuss, a reasonable person would assume that you're not invited into this room. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5895.362s">At</a> that point, and every member of the board gave a different amount of time, either 20, 45, or 90 minutes later, 90 minutes would make it June 1st, because the meeting adjourned after 1030, they made the decision to unanimously <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5910.393s">passed</a> all the variances, 11 variances, unprecedented amount of variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5916.035s">And</a> in their haste to beat you all today, they sent out their certificate with an incorrect address on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5924.899s">So</a> they've actually granted a variance to build 490 units at 361 Locust Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5928.5s">I</a> don't know where that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5939.563s">I</a> think that may be in the middle of the Mystic, which I'm cool with if they want to build it there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5946.968s">But,</a> you know, the race was on. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5948.789s">They</a> were very gleeful this morning that, you know, we're done with this complaint and we'll be filing it right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5955.413s">And</a> when I said, well, there is a hearing, a meeting going on at City Council tonight, they'll be discussing this, and Chairman Noreen giggled. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5963.238s">Several</a> times during the meeting, he said, you know, it was a very informal discussion to vote to approve these variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5969.443s">And</a> he very proudly said, I believe I said, let's rock and roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5972.705s">People,</a> did I say let's rock and roll before we voted on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5976.128s">So</a> he clearly does not take this seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5979.75s">He</a> doesn't, he didn't take the consideration of any of the citizenry. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5983.953s">And</a> if you read this report, this decision, it reads 100% as if he works for the developer. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5993.132s">I</a> mean, let's start on page six. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5996.656s">The</a> land is contaminated since the 90s. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6000.219s">It's</a> not allowed to be used for residential housing with gardens or playgrounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6005.545s">It</a> continues on to page seven, but hey, it'd be really expensive if he had to clean the site, so we're just going to pave it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6013.293s">Didn't</a> we just fix the land on the DPW? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6015.655s">I</a> believe I sat in meetings where the estimates that the consultants exceeded $500,000 for the cleaning, but they're not going to clean it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6024.781s">Now</a> my kid can't play here, but somebody else's kid is going to live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6029.524s">So</a> in 10 years, will we be back that these children are developing cancer? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6035.397s">I'm</a> concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6036.158s">They're</a> not concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6038.441s">If</a> you turn over to page 8, the zoning ordinance says if we make them follow the law, it will be a substantial hardship, financial or otherwise, to the appellate. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6046.289s">I'm</a> sorry, this is a board that works for the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6050.957s">I</a> don't care how much money the developer makes. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6053.238s">How</a> much is this going to cost me in extra police? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6055.979s">Are</a> we going to have the extra police? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6057.199s">Are</a> we going to be short? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6057.96s">Are</a> we going to have enough firemen? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6059.48s">If</a> something's going on over there and then something happens on the other side of the city, are we going to be short? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6064.022s">Are</a> the schools going to be overrun? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6065.803s">These</a> are the things that I'm concerned about. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6067.423s">I'm</a> not concerned about the man living on Park Avenue in New York City and if he loses a zero off of his project. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6076.246s">The</a> literal enforcement of this would reduce the project's capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6080.95s">So</a> there would be a substantial loss of dwelling units. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6085.712s">Again,</a> I really, I'm not concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6088.753s">Why</a> is it that this project is approved and practically applauded when in West Medford 30 units was too much? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6098.397s">Way</a> too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6099.617s">Come</a> back with something smaller. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6100.958s">This</a> is 490 units and on page nine it says it's a vibrant mixed use <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6108.166s">project,</a> 7,000 square feet total retail. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6113.391s">3,000</a> will be the existing Eastern Bank, which they'll move to the other side of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6117.055s">So</a> we're talking 4,000 square feet of retail, convenience retail. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6121.699s">When</a> someone asked at that meeting, would this be a coffee shop possibly? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6125.803s">Oh,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6126.764s">We're</a> not going to have a coffee shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6128.385s">So</a> I think we're looking at a convenience store and a dry cleaner. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6131.108s">That's</a> a fabulous addition to the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6133.911s">This</a> is the stations landing type development that Burke promised us in the article in the transcript before the May 18th meeting of the Community Coalition. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6143.621s">A</a> dry cleaner in a convenience store? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6147.766s">I</a> don't know why anyone would want this or say this is anything like stations landing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6152.15s">These</a> are rental units. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6154.724s">Millennials,</a> I can tell you they own cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6157.149s">They're</a> going to park here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6158.832s">They</a> want us to pay to build paths to Hormel so they can park their extra cars there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6163.783s">They</a> want us to pay to build a path to Cumming Street so these residents can have them walking through as they go to park in the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6169.744s">They're</a> charging for the extra parking space for anyone that wants an extra parking space and units. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6175.085s">So</a> they'll be paying approximately $3,000 a month for a two-bedroom and an untold amount for a parking space. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6181.207s">Do</a> you think that they'll stay on their property or do you think that they'll explore the neighborhood and start parking there? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6191.168s">This</a> board did not consider the needs of the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6193.529s">They</a> did not consider the needs of the city, and the developers will come. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6197.511s">They'll</a> say, this is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6199.872s">May</a> 18th, they had a meeting, and the community development people said, oh, you're going to expand the water line?

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=89.492s">So,</a> my name is Cheryl Rodriguez, and I'm a parent at the Roberts Elementary School, and I'm involved in the art show that's happening in May. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=97.134s">I</a> think the teacher was my mom. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=100.254s">We</a> were fortunate to get a grant this year from the Massachusetts Cultural Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=103.435s">We</a> do have arts and residents in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=105.175s">We</a> have a student author come in, and she's going to be helping the students, every student who's going to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=114.737s">and</a> create a mural on the second floor outside the art room. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=118.14s">It</a> will be a mosaic. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=119.881s">So,</a> he ran probably the entire cost of the art, and we were able to get some funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=126.986s">But</a> supply would be too, of course, for cover.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=186.948s">We</a> do not. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=187.668s">All</a> students voted that the final theme is the many cultures of the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=192.69s">Last</a> week, in one day, our teacher asked everyone in their country of origin, and we had 41 countries from one day. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=199.713s">So</a> they're going to have to design something to try to incorporate all those cultures. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=203.575s">They'll</a> be a record of them coming out. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=205.856s">The</a> project is supposed to start in May. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=210.558s">They'll</a> all come together make one they'll be mounted on like separate bars So they'll be able to be removed if so it won't damage the wall But they'll be supported and we have talked to the buildings department to make sure it's safely installed. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=237.304s">They'll</a> be installed
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=388.523s">I</a> did go into Blick personally, and they said they had never heard of that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=392.444s">Someone</a> did make me aware that this program exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=395.024s">So</a> that is something I'm still exploring. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=397.865s">We</a> also have a membership to extras for creative reuse, which I recommend for all the art teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=403.506s">$80</a> for the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=404.006s">You</a> can go in 10 times and take as much as you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=406.407s">I've</a> gone in and gotten a lot of tile that we'll be incorporating into the mosaic. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=411.548s">We</a> also use that for the art show, and we're using that for our science night, so it really cuts our supply costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=416.31s">So</a> I'm doing as much as I can to mitigate the costs, but there will be some.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=440.013s">We're</a> actually not painting. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=441.414s">This</a> is a tile mosaic and will be grouted. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=446.257s">I</a> can certainly reach out to them, see if they have any extra supplies. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=450.0s">I</a> definitely reach out as far as I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=453.022s">Me,</a> I can attest that I reach far and wide.
