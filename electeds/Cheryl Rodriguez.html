 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21294.107s">Hi,</a> Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21296.926s">What</a> stands out to me is there's no call for study or analysis in this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21301.289s">So</a> opinions will still be the entire basis for the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21304.392s">There's</a> no set timeline or process outlined here. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21307.254s">Why</a> was this not brought forward in the planning and permitting committee in coordination with the mayor's office to create a real timeline and specific processes that might happen before new zoning is written? <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21316.861s">The</a> zoning should be called back to planning and permitting and properly written. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21320.803s">The</a> unstudied Salem Street and Mystic Ave zoning should not remain intact. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21324.604s">They</a> were subjected to the same lack of analysis and study, so deserve the same treatment as the NR district's need. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21330.485s">Reverting</a> Park and Salem to MX2 added two floors of height and all the uses that were taken out as too close to the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21337.987s">So</a> we resent that you're saying it's one change was not adopted. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21341.788s">The</a> parking minimum should be set before any zoning is passed and should reflect actual conditions, as even President Bierce has admitted cars are the primary transportation residents use. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21351.65s">So</a> the OR item to remove parking minimums is in direct contradiction of the reality of car ownership in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21358.311s">There</a> is no urgency to rezone and no need to rezone poorly. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21362.812s">There</a> are existing conditions analysis that must be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21366.273s">Impacts</a> must be considered. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21368.248s">low</a> to our infrastructure have to be factored in. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21370.971s">All</a> of these measures are called for in the comprehensive plan, climate plan, and housing production plan that this body mentions frequently, but is not following. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21380.961s">You</a> are not following any of these plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21382.963s">It</a> is not as simple as quote, we just need density. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21386.166s">The</a> new zoning as written encourages luxury housing and discourages affordable housing in many ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21392.596s">It</a> does not encourage businesses or vibrant commercial areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21396.838s">Oversimplifying</a> this process will be to our detriment. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21400.499s">A</a> strong path forward must include analysis. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21403.84s">If</a> Ennis is unable to perform the work appropriately, then perhaps we now should seek a different consultant. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21410.243s">Our</a> zoning is too important to be written without any solid basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21413.984s">Doing</a> something poorly and causing harm is not better than doing nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21419.085s">Opinions</a> are not enough, no matter whose opinions they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21422.73s">That's</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21424.011s">Thanks.</a> <h2><a href="../2025-07-10_-nzz6eWSWpU/2025-07-10_-nzz6eWSWpU.html">Community Development Board 07-09-25</a></h2>

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6384.128s">Hi,</a> I'm Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6388.171s">And</a> I know I've said this first part before, but this board and the public have been asking for documentation ahead of meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6395.497s">I</a> didn't have time today to look an hour before the meeting, which is actually early for us, as most of the time it's posted during the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6402.923s">How</a> often am I expected to check if I want to look at the data before the meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6407.486s">and</a> I often come up empty. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6409.127s">It</a> feels deliberate and disrespectful. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6411.409s">If</a> we can't keep up, we need to slow down. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6414.291s">We</a> aren't setting this pace. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6418.014s">The</a> public isn't setting this pace. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6419.455s">There</a> is no rush just because people who haven't read this are saying because it isn't available or saying it looks good to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6425.919s">It</a> doesn't look good because it doesn't really exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6428.801s">We</a> need to do this right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6429.942s">I</a> had seconds to review part of this, so I'm not sure if this question <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6434.97s">is</a> valid or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6436.631s">Is</a> the new building coverage definition going to include the state required to be allowed ADU in the percentage, which I thought was not allowed to be included in the density amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6447.799s">Could</a> this prevent most homeowners from adding an ADU if they aren't adding it to an existing structure? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6454.444s">It</a> appears that a covered porch will count towards the lot coverage and could prevent someone from having an ADU. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6462.957s">So</a> that's my one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6464.318s">And</a> then just another part is that we're keep referring to the comprehensive plan, which was mostly a wishlist and a list of studies to conduct and strategies to come up with before we zoned. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6476.044s">It</a> was written by a group of consultants, including Ennis and maybe members of the planning department with slides being created before any community feedback had been gathered that had selected quarters and such already in them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6489.692s">and</a> the pictures and the colored circle stickers at some community events during COVID with a majority of the public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6497.174s">I</a> don't know why there's so much confusion that this is being used as a roadmap for zoning changes without any study, even if it was based on community feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6506.756s">The</a> old slide decks still exist online and I have read the plan and the slideshows shown to the public and encourage others to do so before claiming it's supposed to be informing our zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6517.678s">Please</a> do this properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6519.459s">Sound</a> Street is an example of doing things poorly and quickly, and that also deserves to be revisited later. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6525.6s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5853.924s">Hi,</a> I'm Cheryl Rodriguez at 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5857.406s">I</a> noticed that some of these extra conversations tonight about things that weren't before the board are a little confusing to members of the public, but I'm curious about how the NR zoning is now being passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5870.072s">by</a> the square zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5871.893s">And</a> the square zoning has some of the areas like, for example, West Medford Square zoned more densely than they are in the NR maps. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5880.477s">So</a> I'm wondering how they're going to reconcile that if just the square zoning passes first, then the NR zoning will down zone the square areas, particularly the UR areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5892.322s">Also,</a> when I'm looking at the Medford Square map, I noticed that the very large lots on the north side of High Street and Square are only zoned as NR2. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5900.274s">Um,</a> which is pretty low considering they're right on high street and the sound street corridor was given no such exemptions despite having no rapid transit or a large square that would support the density. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5911.298s">So</a> that seems misplaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5912.719s">I</a> did mention it at the subcommittee meetings and it was ignored and bypassed. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5916.957s">Um,</a> NR3 and West in the rapid transit circle exactly matches the density of Glenwood, which again, we don't have any rapid transit. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5924.886s">So</a> it seems right inside that quarter mile circle that West is zoned pretty low. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5929.691s">And</a> if <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5931.85s">Glenwood</a> is going to stand, and they should stand taller than us. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5936.132s">I</a> noticed tonight we're talking about design and development standards, and Salem Street was placed on one of the maps that you showed that now we're concerned about shadow study. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5945.515s">When</a> the Salem Street neighbors rallied and asked for shadow studies, we were told that that wasn't done. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5950.777s">We</a> were quite shut down. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5952.738s">And</a> it's very concerning that the Salem Street zoning is live right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5956.879s">It</a> doesn't have any of these design standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5959.661s">It</a> can happen just the way that it is with no regard for shadow. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5963.044s">So</a> I'm not sure why we didn't wait to allow the zoning to be used before the design standards when there's so much developer pressure on Sale Street that we were rushing to get the zoning through so the developers wouldn't miss the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5975.012s">And</a> now those buildings can happen without consideration of our sunlight or design standards because those things don't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5982.274s">So</a> I feel that it can be too little too late for many of us here on the South Street quarter. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5987.436s">And</a> I wish that more attention and study had been paid to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5990.637s">I'm</a> glad to see that now some of the other areas are getting more attention than we ever got. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=5995.838s">But</a> I'm concerned that suddenly the city is also notifying about the neighborhood zoning, eight meetings into the neighborhood zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=6003.072s">so</a> that people didn't find out ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=6005.452s">And</a> now we're scrambling and that's why it's taking extra meetings because people have questions because they're just finding out about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=6011.753s">So</a> I know that there's an urgent rush for the city council and I appreciate that this board is not responding to their pressure and is taking their time and trying to look through these proposals. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=6022.755s">But</a> I hope that when we do the cleanup that we can remember the areas that we really rushed through and didn't give as much consideration and thought as the areas that we're doing now. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=6031.857s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-05-28_IdMgzj9PVYQ/2025-05-28_IdMgzj9PVYQ.html">CPlanning and Permitting Committee Meeting 05-28-25</a></h2>

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6547.553s">Hi,</a> Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6550.494s">I</a> got the link that you posted at 621 that had the zoning language, so I was hope we can get it earlier next time so that we can review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6558.936s">I</a> would definitely change the name of the MX1 because there are several differences in that opposed to the one on Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6566.862s">Since</a> you're allowing pot shops in the squares by ZBA approval and they were excluded from Salem Street, this can be very confusing, even to a developer who's trying to go through the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6578.35s">And</a> I noticed in the NR3 in the West Medford Square that you're allowing scientific search, which also was not allowed in the NR3. <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6587.615s">before</a> the Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6589.356s">So</a> I don't know if these are typos, inconsistencies or differences, but I hope that someone will be going through and pulling this all together so that it's consistent and so that people can follow along and understand what's really coming for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6603.725s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-06-26_A9cRMSDehTg/2025-06-26_A9cRMSDehTg.html">Community Development Board 04-16-25</a></h2>

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7250.565s">Cheryl</a> Rodriguez, 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7252.747s">So</a> I have here the petition from change.org with over 1100 signatures opposed to the Salem Street corridor zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7266.51s">We're</a> not asking for no zoning changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7268.51s">We're</a> asking for the studies to be conducted and the zoning to be written based on that data. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7273.031s">This</a> isn't about opinions. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7274.271s">It</a> isn't about how many people raise their hands and say, yay. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7276.992s">This</a> isn't just about creating housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7279.572s">There</a> is a large scale increase in zoning concentrated into an area that is already dense and lacking in transit access. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7287.454s">Our</a> quality of life, existing conditions and results of the necessary studies are what should largely shape this zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7295.055s">The</a> only argument for packing it all in here is that it's already dense. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7298.916s">So</a> who cares? <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7300.117s">If</a> the density was spread more equitably, then our less dense neighbors with larger lots would be able to relieve us of some of the burden to focus so much density here. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7310.556s">Residents</a> have been saying that reducing lot size from 10k to 3k makes the planned zoning impossible and at the March 5th CDB meeting Emily Ennis from Innes Associates admitted that there are several infeasibilities in the current zoning proposal which are not resolved before passing it back to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7329.21s">So</a> one of the reasons she gave for the failure was the small lots that made it impossible to add parking and hope to change the parking minimums after the zoning has passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7338.581s">Those</a> small lots though also make the buildings too small to require affordable units. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7344.148s">So</a> there's no affordable housing coming here. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7351.178s">Parking</a> is already difficult here, and a second reduction in the parking minimums will have a profound impact on our quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7357.507s">That</a> 0.8 spaces isn't sounding so far-fetched now, is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7361.685s">The</a> studies required and outlined in the comprehensive plan, which I urge you to go back and conduct, and not pass impossible zoning, only to later take out parking minimums to try to squeeze it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7373.712s">These</a> studies should include projected development volume, traffic analysis, shadow studies, environmental impact estimates, and the other studies deemed appropriate to the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7384.377s">The</a> full picture should be clear before a neighborhood is targeted, or as you like to say, up-zoned moderately. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7391.381s">Despite</a> the call for more density near transit, you will note that we aren't near transit. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7396.43s">The</a> most frequent bus that runs down Salem Street is the out-of-service bus on the way to the bus yard. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7402.577s">Please</a> recognize that we are a neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7405.458s">We</a> deserve to have quality of life and so do the people you claim to want to build housing for.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7411.702s">No</a> one dreams of living in an apartment building with little to no green space because 80% lot coverage is allowed and the green score can be waved away with 12 foot sidewalks that'll exacerbate the heat islands that are already here and to have to play where, where can I park every time they drive their car. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7430.051s">Impacts</a> are important to identify and that work, among others, has not been done here. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7435.254s">Conduct</a> the studies and use them to inform the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7438.456s">Don't</a> pass impossible zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7440.658s">Oh,</a> and give the Glenwood neighborhood a call when you decide to zone transit proximate High Street at the same level that we're getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7449.643s">But</a> alas, that's not in your zoning plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7452.305s">One</a> wonders why. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=7453.566s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-06_mPeOR452BSI/2025-03-06_mPeOR452BSI.html">Salem Street CBD -- Continued Public Hearing</a></h2>

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=106.397s">The</a> vision for Salem Street seems to be to transform the area into a corridor that will be filled with dense, tall apartment buildings.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=145.676s">Anything</a> about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=147.798s">Unfortunately</a> for us, even though the comprehensive plan calls for clear studies about traffic, parking, infrastructure, none of those studies have happened, and we're being informed by an urgency for developers who are waiting to pull permits and build on that corridor and want to build the most that they can.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=200.962s">Well,</a> the incentive that the city is offering is that they're reducing the lot size to build an apartment building by 70%. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=207.804s">So</a> for what half of the land required for a single or two-family home will now be able to hold up to a six-story apartment building without the need for any variances, setbacks, and they're going to require or hope that the developer will allow them to build a 12-foot sidewalk using a piece of their land.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=267.593s">Unfortunately,</a> the community has not been given the benefit of any community meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=272.475s">In</a> fact, the meetings that the planning committee is having usually have the agenda item of update from Innes Associates. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=279.657s">And</a> the meetings themselves seem to be driven by the director of our planning department, Alicia Hunt, who is intent on making sure that the developers don't go ahead and build something that they may find too small.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=300.473s">They've</a> decided 35 feet is not enough height for Salem Street and the surrounding side streets.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=352.357s">Well,</a> in 2022, a developer did a traffic study there, and they found around 18,000 cars go down Salem Street a day, close to 2,000 on Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=361.923s">And</a> they're going to build 0.8 parking spaces per unit as an incentive to bring in developers <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=368.707s">without</a> having conducted a parking or a traffic study in that area at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=374.151s">They're</a> going to leave it up to the individual buildings.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=399.721s">I</a> mean, where are people going to park? <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=402.242s">Well,</a> interestingly enough, if you bring up the graphic for the Salem Street neighborhood known that just focuses on the Salem and Park intersection, you'll see that right in that area, they are primed to add probably 350 plus apartments. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=417.63s">So</a> the Medford average is two cars per unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=423.753s">and</a> they're planning 0.8. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=425.454s">So</a> conservatively, we're talking about 350 new cars coming onto that small area with restricted parking already.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=446.074s">Well,</a> the most frequent bus you'll see on Salem Street is the non-in-service because they're on their way back to the T-Garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=452.137s">But</a> we do have one bus that will be changing its route. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=455.799s">And</a> the MBTA has already informed the city that that bus will not run on time unless a bus lane is added. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=462.003s">But</a> physically, the street is not wide enough to hold a bus lane and two-way traffic.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=492.499s">Well,</a> the MBTA is doing a consolidation plan, so they're trying to shift some of the bus routes. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=497.48s">So</a> now instead of the bus going from Malden Center to Sullivan Station, when the new change comes in, it'll go from Revere <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=505.702s">to</a> Union Square, so it's going to pass by Tufts, which is going to harm a lot of people who currently work at Assembly Row and will no longer have access to that area from Salem Street.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=524.148s">Going</a> away, the same thing that happened to the commuter bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=527.479s">we're</a> no longer going to have access to those transportation options, but we're going to have less parking too.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=577.038s">Well,</a> they feel that it's a positive that they're giving us dense housing with limited parking to discourage people from owning vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=586.004s">Unfortunately,</a> the transportation options available for this area are so limited that I think people who now live there without cars are probably going to find themselves needing a car. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=597.584s">And</a> the incentives that they're asking for to increase height on a building, a fountain, a park bench, are not actually incentives for the community and are just an excuse to allow them to build higher buildings.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=626.323s">Well,</a> currently, buildings are allowed to go up to 35 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=630.184s">And</a> with this new zoning, the minimum will now be 40, can be 42 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=635.326s">We</a> can go up to <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=638.293s">54</a> feet or even as high as 78 feet without needing any kind of variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=642.82s">This</a> is all going to be site plan review. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=645.243s">So</a> they just go in and they say what they want and hopefully for them, they just get granted it without any community notification needed.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=667.625s">Unfortunately</a> for two residents that live next to the vacant hole at 290 Salem Street, those single family homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=674.809s">The</a> only buffer that they require for those small homes is a 5-foot landscaped buffer and an 8-foot tall fence, and there are no further setbacks on the sides or the rear required for these buildings, which can now occupy 80 percent of the lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=692.797s">From</a> 40 to 50 percent, they're now allowed 80 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=696.688s">This</a> is a huge change for people living in that area.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=781.106s">Well,</a> they're calling these mixed-use districts, so they're wanting there to be first floor commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=786.909s">But</a> when you read the zoning, you find that you don't actually have to provide any commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=792.132s">You</a> can, by right, just build a straight-up apartment building with zero economic development. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=799.122s">at</a> all in the whole building.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=816.896s">And</a> even to call it mixed use, if you put in a lobby that's just for the residents of the building, they're calling that mixed use.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=860.338s">Well,</a> unfortunately, uh, the planning committee has decided that rezoning urgently for developers is more important than heat islands, so, which is why they're requiring 12-foot sidewalks and 80% lot coverage in an area that already suffers from heat islands. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=879.163s">They're</a> also not pausing to make any kind of affordability plan for this corridor because the need for any housing is more urgent than <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=889.781s">the</a> need to take the time to plan to make sure we gain affordable housing on these already extremely small lots that will not naturally produce affordable housing.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=990.588s">Well,</a> even just the name of this zoning, the Salem Street Corridor District, it takes away the fact that there are neighborhoods here. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=998.995s">These</a> are very dense neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1000.857s">This</a> is an environmental justice neighborhood with a large amount of people who are not <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1005.921s">citizens,</a> their residents who may not speak English, a lot of lower income people live here, people who don't have time to scour the city website to look and see what is actually happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1019.01s">And</a> the bulk of this happened during the month of December, which is a very busy month for most people, and people are not listening to four-hour <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1028.216s">planning</a> committee meetings to see if the street near their home is being mentioned and being changed in such a dramatic way because there's a fundamental belief that if they're going to do something this dramatic to my neighborhood, surely they will notify us. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1045.34s">They'll</a> let us know. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1046.22s">They'll</a> come out to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1047.72s">They'll</a> meet with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1049.02s">They'll</a> take in our input and then inform the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1052.141s">But</a> unfortunately, that's not what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1055.202s">So</a> none of that took place? <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1057.903s">No,</a> the meetings happened with one to two people in the room and they just kept moving forward and saying that they had all the community input they needed in 2022 and they were working on the comprehensive plan.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1084.951s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1085.431s">Interestingly</a> enough, the input from 2022 on Salem Street was, the traffic is terrible here. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1091.874s">This</a> street is a nightmare. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1093.815s">Alicia</a> Hunt herself said, even when I had children in the Roberts, I refused to drive on Salem Street because Salem Street is terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1104.667s">So</a> I don't know where they got, you know, that'd be a great place to put a couple thousand apartments.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1146.046s">From</a> a brief conversation I had with the fire department, they do not have the equipment nor the manpower to handle a corridor full of 42 to 78 foot skinny, no space between apartment buildings.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1167.291s">I</a> did speak to a member of the fire department and they said they didn't know why they were not brought into this conversation.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1239.906s">I</a> feel like I've definitely been thrust into the role of the town crier, like, look over here, this something big is happening and, and you're gonna miss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1248.632s">And</a> it feels like I'm coming against a city council that seems to be run by activists. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1253.695s">They're</a> using the mindset of we need housing now with <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1257.337s">without</a> hesitation, without pause for study. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1260.979s">And</a> that's not what our government should be writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1263.261s">Our</a> government should be saying, we do in fact need housing, but we need to do studies and inform the housing that we build so that we don't overwhelm an area or create the wrong type of housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1275.048s">Does</a> Medford need this much more luxury housing? <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1279.231s">If</a> every one of those buildings only has nine units in it, that will be a net of zero affordable units. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1286.936s">Will</a> that benefit a community where we have thousands of families that need an affordable unit and we're only creating luxury units?
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1322.293s">Well,</a> if you do research on these units, you'll find that about 25% of these units have one or more schoolchildren. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1329.558s">This</a> is not something that was presented by the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1332.499s">This</a> is something that if you do research into the type of housing that's being built and the fact that there aren't homes for all of these families to live in, so they're living in apartments. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1345.207s">which</a> is not the same as has always been and the schools that they're planning to feed these children into are already very full. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1354.272s">They're</a> high five hundreds and they're only made for 600 children.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1459.326s">Unfortunately</a> for us, this plan is on the urgent track and moving very quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1464.65s">There</a> are two meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1465.85s">They've</a> already advertised the final meeting when they plan to vote this through, so there's a meeting on February 5th, which is the continuation of the Community Development Board meeting, and that is being held on Zoom only. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1479.64s">The</a> final vote is set to be taken on February 11th at the City Council meeting at 7 o'clock at City Hall, and <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1487.905s">people</a> need to speak up. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1489.466s">They</a> need to start emailing Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1491.387s">They</a> need to email the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1492.807s">They</a> need to email the Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1495.509s">And</a> they need to tell them to pause and appropriately study this zoning before they push it through. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1502.772s">The</a> consequences for the neighborhood if they don't could be significant.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1531.015s">And</a> I can guarantee you there are permits ready to be submitted as soon as that zoning is live. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1535.196s">We</a> have an open pit at 290 Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1537.997s">In</a> the Park Street graphic, there are five parcels that are owned by one developer. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1543.998s">So</a> that's six parcels that could be ready to go by spring.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1583.051s">There</a> is a rush to add housing, but we're not doing it strategically. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1586.992s">If</a> we go back to the comprehensive plan, there are specific studies that are called for. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1592.073s">There's</a> guidelines and things that you're supposed to do to try to prevent displacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1596.394s">This</a> is an environmental justice neighborhood, and it's not the only neighborhood they're planning to go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1601.675s">They're</a> planning to go to Boston Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1603.156s">They're</a> planning to go to Main Street, which are also environmental justice areas, and push more density on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1609.357s">Why</a> are only the environmental justice neighborhoods <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1613.779s">that</a> are already very dense being targeted for such increased density while other neighborhoods are preserved at low density, untouched.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1632.006s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1633.246s">Boston</a> Ave and Main Street have already been identified as corridors by the planning committee.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1641.128s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1641.969s">That's</a> all I can say to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1643.529s">Anyone</a> that's been down Boston Ave knows it's a parking lot most of the time.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1718.465s">We</a> know there's six members that are in favor, and they're ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1721.586s">They</a> want their housing on Sale Street, and they want to move on to the next street.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1781.258s">It's</a> doing something. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1782.279s">Unfortunately,</a> what it's doing is rapidly gentrifying the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1787.582s">It's</a> going to price people out. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1789.183s">People</a> are not going to be able to live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1792.325s">People</a> are not going to be able to get to work because the bus is changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1794.886s">People</a> are going to need places to park. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1797.468s">You're</a> going to be touring the area looking for a parking space when you get home from work. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1802.17s">It's</a> going to be <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1803.831s">a</a> mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1804.252s">And</a> this is not a it could happen, this is we have developers who are ready to build, according to Alicia Hunt, they are ready to pull permits, and if they don't urgently pass this zoning, then the buildings may be smaller than the planning committee and the planning department would like. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1821.855s">So</a> there's no regard for current residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1824.337s">There's</a> little regard for future residents as they're not planning any huge infrastructure or parking upgrades for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1831.784s">There's</a> just an assumption that people won't have children and won't have cars, which is not a realistic assumption to base zoning an entire area on. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1843.615s">We</a> need studies. <a href="https://youtu.be/IRkFyWb1iJU&t=1845.436s">We</a> need them now, before this is passed.<h2><a href="../2025-06-26_kOuBy-MtMpc/2025-06-26_kOuBy-MtMpc.html">Community Development Board 01-22-25</a></h2>

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20852.644s">Hi,</a> Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20855.244s">I'm</a> pretty much a direct abutter to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20857.685s">There</a> were a lot of neighbors that were here and left. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20861.266s">This</a> meeting started yesterday, five hours and 46 minutes ago, and they couldn't stay any longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20867.587s">I</a> really don't think this should be voted to go forward today without their input. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20872.788s">Because</a> much like you, the last resolution where you say Tufts is bullying the city, many residents in that neighborhood feel that this committee, the planning committee, is bullying us. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20882.973s">This</a> zoning is a 70% reduction in the lot size needed to build an apartment building on Salem Street and the side streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20893.755s">Somerville</a> is the densest city in our nation with a population density of 19,656.8 people per square mile. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20903.404s">That</a> translates to 30.7 people per acre. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20907.447s">A</a> side street zoning off of Salem Street that was proposed by your committee <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20912.552s">will</a> have 87 families per acre. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20914.834s">That's</a> the side street. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20916.415s">Even</a> a family of two would make the minimum you are proposing six times the density that exists in Somerville, the nation's densest city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20927.342s">The</a> Salem Street zoning of six floors on a 3,000 square foot lot would be 174 families per acre. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20937.876s">if</a> we guess at 12 units per building, and 12 times what Somerville has. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20943.998s">The</a> MBCA Communities Act that many cities are suing to avoid complying with is only 15 units per acre. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20952.761s">The</a> minimum zoning on side streets is six times that much. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20958.177s">and</a> about 12 times in the six-story zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20961.759s">All</a> these buildings are proposed on lots too small for a single family home to be built on. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20970.168s">Don't</a> laugh as you live in West Medford with 6,000 square feet to build a single, and my neighborhood is going to have dozens of units. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20979.257s">Please</a> direct her not to make faces at me.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20983.601s">The</a> lots are so small that most of these lots will add zero affordable units. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20990.388s">10%</a> of six units is zero. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20992.99s">Zero</a> units. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20993.771s">It's</a> not a full unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20996.141s">These</a> will all be luxury priced units. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20999.224s">The</a> zoning also allows by special permit pot shops. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=21003.428s">With</a> all this dense residential housing, you have allowed pot shops on this street. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=21009.974s">Car</a> ownership in Massachusetts is at 87.9%. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=21013.417s">In</a> Medford specifically, the average car ownership is two cars per household. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=21020.694s">We</a> are not near rapid transit. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=21023.058s">We</a> only have one low-frequency bus that takes you to the T. They will own cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=21029.588s">Reducing</a> or removing parking will lead to hundreds of cars on the street looking for parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=21035.919s">These</a> lots are too small for large amounts of parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=21038.24s">23.6%</a> of households have school age children. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=21041.801s">We</a> can't support that amount of children added to our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=21044.782s">This</a> neighborhood can't handle all the density. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=21047.764s">This</a> is gross negligence and shows a complete lack of care for quality of life for current and future residents in this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=21055.427s">And</a> a lack of understanding of the fact that residential is a negative return for a municipality <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=21062.089s">And</a> if this goes through, we cannot financially support the density you are proposing.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=21069.855s">One</a> more sentence, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=21070.756s">Sure.</a> 
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=21072.738s">There</a> is no commercial percentage requirements to help make this zoning self-sufficient and is far too dense. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=21080.944s">Please</a> don't push this forward without the community having a chance to survive. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=21085.888s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3789.466s">Well,</a> just for clarity, are we going to allow pot shops on Salem Street since it's now a corridor?
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3857.17s">I'd</a> love confirmation.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3965.024s">Cheryl</a> Rodriguez, 281 Park Street, ground zero for this outrageous proposal. I know everyone was looking for a simplification. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3972.946s">Simplification</a> is 3,000 square foot lot would allow a minimum of six units of housing, which is an attack on my neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3980.708s">Currently,</a> you need 5,000 square feet to build a single, and this would be <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3986.533s">The</a> equivalent of 12 for where you could normally build a single and an area with severely restricted parking and a very narrow, very busy street. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3996.584s">If</a> you've asked anyone in any of these neighborhoods, and this is not limited to Salem Street, this is going fingering down all the side streets in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4006.795s">all</a> this dense housing, not one single person living in that area, and there's someone here who doesn't live in that area, and we'll tell you it's great, has said we'd love more traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4016.579s">We'd</a> love six units of housing on a three foot square lot, and oh, please don't make them build parking because we have so much extra parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4025.262s">We</a> don't have any parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4027.123s">Salem</a> Street is not a bustling commercial corridor. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4029.984s">It's</a> a mix of convenience stores, smoke shops, pizza places, and lots of already dense housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4037.423s">It's</a> an always busy cut through street made more narrow recently despite the high volume of trucks and out of service buses that pass through all day. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4047.711s">The</a> parking is so scarce that the traffic department didn't remove one single spot when adding in their dangerous bike lane that cars and trucks drive through all day as the lane on the other side is too small to accommodate large vehicles safely. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4065.362s">Many</a> side streets, including Park Street, Parris Street, Court Street, have areas where there is no parking allowed on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4074.625s">The</a> streets are too narrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4076.106s">You</a> can't fit cars there. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4079.127s">The</a> lots are small, and these joining changes would destroy the area and add so many cars with nowhere to park them and so many people. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4088.735s">These</a> tall buildings with little to no parking will destroy the quality of life for the area between shadow and lack of parking and increases to already heavy traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4099.948s">A</a> single bus comes down this road once or twice an hour at the busy times. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4106.96s">Perhaps</a> you're unfamiliar with Salem Street, but if you go out the parking lot, take a right, go to the second exit around the Rotary, you'll see us. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4115.243s">We're</a> there. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4116.103s">We're</a> paying taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4117.663s">We're</a> a very dense and busy area. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4120.244s">What</a> you won't see there is a bustling commercial corridor. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4124.746s">Our</a> quality of life can't constantly be on the table in order to only increase density in the areas that are already too dense, the areas that you're dismissing. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4136.553s">If</a> you need density, perhaps it's time to look west. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4140.994s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-12-02_53d9Rk8X1OU/2024-12-02_53d9Rk8X1OU.html">12.2.2024 - Regular MSC Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10597.097s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10598.358s">Cheryl</a> Rodriguez, 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10601.961s">Can</a> you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10603.874s">Yes,</a> we can hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10604.794s">Okay,</a> so. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10608.116s">I</a> noticed that the students really weren't considered in this entire presentation, how this is affecting them. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10614.218s">It</a> seemed to be more of a logistic thing, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10616.96s">Right</a> now, there's no bathrooms open in the building and we're talking about hiring a staff member. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10622.322s">And</a> only being able to open 1 bathroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10625.396s">Currently,</a> if all the bathrooms on the schedule are open, that's one stall per 100 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10632.844s">And</a> the students are not all aware of what bathrooms are open, because the office staff isn't even aware of all the office's bathrooms open, because I have called multiple times and asked them what bathrooms are open, and they've told me it's at the discretion of the principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10647.674s">And</a> I noticed that it was said that the main foyer key bathroom was available to be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10653.597s">And</a> when I was in the school last week, the security monitor told me that that key had been taken away from him. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10659.161s">The</a> student had come and asked for the key, and he said he didn't have the key. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10663.503s">So</a> currently, without any bathrooms open in the B building, students are looking at a two to three minute walk from the B building if they have to go to the cafeteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10673.104s">And</a> if it's lunchtime, they're probably gonna be gone for 20 to 30 minutes after they wait in line because the only bathrooms open at lunch, which is also period four, are at the cafeteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10685.532s">And</a> just last week, my student went and tried to use the bathroom and there were at least six students in each stall vaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10694.378s">And</a> they went into the guidance office and asked for the key and were asked why they couldn't use the regular bathroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10700.582s">And</a> when they told them that was the first they had heard that there were at least a dozen students in the girls bathroom who were vaping because there was no detector going off. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10711.871s">So</a> currently what we have is students are struggling to find open bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10717.295s">When</a> they do find them, they're full of people vaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10722.153s">And</a> also the bathrooms are clearly not being monitored now. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10726.078s">So</a> I don't know why we would need an entire staff person to watch B3 bathroom when the bathrooms that are open now. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10734.033s">are</a> clearly not being monitored and students are not able to use them fully. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10740.258s">Using</a> the bathroom is a human right and we need to consider that these students are people and they should be treated humanely. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10748.185s">This</a> bathroom situation is going on for far too long and I didn't hear any real resolution in that presentation nor acknowledgement of the difficulties that our students are facing in real time. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10758.835s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-06-26_FsCuJDIgIlM/2025-06-26_FsCuJDIgIlM.html">Community Development Board 11-06-24</a></h2>

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10725.54s">I'm</a> a little taller than the one before me. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10729.262s">Cheryl</a> Rodriguez, Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10731.864s">I</a> just wanted a little info before my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10734.865s">Medford's</a> in the top third per people spend for the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10737.867s">If</a> you factor in the residential exemption, Medford is on the same level as Somerville and Malden for taxation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10743.93s">In</a> 2022-23 school year, in March 1st of 2024, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10750.874s">103</a> ELL students were added, bringing our percentage of ELL students up from a stable 10% to 15%. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10757.099s">These</a> students are very costly to educate, probably contribute to the issues that you're speaking of. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10762.422s">The</a> state should be stepping in to help us. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10764.624s">That</a> is an enormous increase of students that are very expensive to educate. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10770.281s">Two</a> admins were added when the emergency free cash was added to our school budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10775.124s">And</a> the more money that we add to our school budget, the less state aid we'll get and our bill for the charter school will also increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10782.992s">So</a> my question is, if we can't pay for basics, why would we extend the school day and increase wages solely based on the extension of the school day, which is how question eight is written. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10796.701s">When</a> we can't pay raise the cover rate, because when the next contract comes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10802.318s">we'll</a> have to do the raises based on these inflated salaries that we can't afford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10806.063s">I</a> got an answer from a school committee member today, and the answer was ultimately, the school committee will decide how this money is spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10814.696s">So</a> there's no guarantee that what's in the questions is actually even going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10819.44s">Another</a> one told me that the money that we will gain in the school department will be used to have conversations, and we can discuss wish list items. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10830.148s">We're</a> way over is the question about the question is, if we can't pay for basics. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10835.732s">Why</a> would we extend the school day and increase wages to reflect a longer working period when we can't pay the raises at current levels? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10844.802s">This</a> is, of course, contingent on if we're actually planning to follow the words and the questions.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11193.133s">I'd</a> just like to follow up, if she's done, about the question on the difference in the students and the cost per student per year.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11204.099s">Councilor</a> Callahan mentioned that the students' differences are calculated based on different amounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11210.121s">But</a> when I looked at the data, Medford appeared in the top third for the entire state. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11214.282s">The</a> schools that were below it were approximately $6,000 to $8,000 less per student. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11220.104s">Even</a> if we factored in the tech spend of $500,000 that the councilor mentioned, that only averages out to about $1,000 per student. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11229.227s">So</a> I haven't seen any evidence that Medford is spending significantly less than other schools, that we're not spending enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11235.773s">I</a> know no one answered about the whole increase in the ELL students, but these are factors that are actually impacting our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11243.04s">And</a> if the council, we're not going to catch up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11245.323s">There's</a> another 15 ELL students waiting to join those schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11248.566s">And</a> if we don't get more money from the state, this override is going to be nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11252.119s">It's</a> good.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11262.597s">No,</a> I literally said they are very expensive.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11285.494s">The</a> state should be helping pay for those students.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11288.176s">That's</a> not what we do.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11300.781s">But</a> council shouldn't be attacking residents.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11318.547s">So</a> I hope that this council will advocate for more state money.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11403.07s">I</a> was told it was to extend the day.

<a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6490.37s">You</a> must move to change the zoning now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6492.351s">Otherwise,</a> a for-profit company will look for the cheapest real estate, even in the middle of a residential area where it doesn't belong, and just seek to open with minimal notice as a medical facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6504.057s">They</a> need not provide any medical attention or treatment, merely a pill dispensed from a for-profit vendor whose purpose is to file as many claims for as many doses as they can to make a larger profit without regard for the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6520.219s">Habit</a> opened in Springfield on a street with two treatment centers in existence with no issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6525.383s">Suddenly</a> there was open drug use, prostitution, drug dealers, and other crime that was described as an open air drug market. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6532.47s">The</a> police chief increased patrols in the area and drove crime into the neighboring streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6538.12s">which</a> here would all be residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6541.381s">Efforts</a> by the city to reach Habit were ignored, and then the press moved on and left the neighbors to deal with the pain. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6548.283s">Habit</a> has an opioid dispensary at Mass and Cass, and it too is an open air drug market. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6552.905s">The</a> Globe and the Herald recently reported that the police attempting to stop the open drug use found that it just moved over a few blocks. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6560.527s">and</a> then moved back when they tried to disperse them from the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6564.13s">What</a> impact will this have on any recovering addicts who live in our neighborhood and now have to be exposed to open drug use where they live? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6572.036s">And</a> what impact on others living in the area or the dancing school or the nearby restaurant or the elementary school that has nearly 600 children? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6581.043s">The</a> neighborhood has been fighting to be heard and is the only reason that we even know this project was on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6588.148s">10</a> people were notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6589.63s">Multiple</a> people have printed and delivered flyers, they have picketed, they have collected signatures. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6594.775s">Under</a> the current application, as only a medical facility, the city is not required to provide a community meeting as they would with a pot dispensary. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6603.263s">This</a> business that will harm entire neighborhoods and the current zoning allows them to only notify 10 people?

href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3223.726s">So</a> you won't realize how many loopholes there are in our zoning laws until you have someone break ground on construction next door to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3234.395s">On</a> that Memorial Day weekend, a dumpster was delivered at 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3237.616s">and</a> the first sound we heard was a window being tossed out a hole on a second floor and then the entire contents, walls of that house, floors, everything flung from the second floor window. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3250.261s">You</a> can just imagine what a dust cloud that is to have that happen for two, three, four months every day because there are no procedures in Medford that require them to mitigate the dust. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3262.385s">So</a> once they pull the window out, they can just fling things willy-nilly out the window and cover your home in a cloud. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3269.33s">So</a> your heating and air conditioning filters will be clogged with the construction debris. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3276.696s">If</a> you have a swimming pool in the backyard, <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3279.698s">You</a> won't be able to swim in it because you'll never be able to get it clean because there'll be constant debris coming into the pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3286.484s">There</a> are no requirements to notify you that they're going to be flinging debris out the window for months on end. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3294.33s">So</a> you cannot protect your property, you can't protect your vehicle. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3298.713s">Nails</a> will fly into your driveway, you'll get flat tires. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3305.11s">And</a> this goes on because this is entirely allowed in our zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3309.492s">There's</a> no regulation requiring them to mitigate the items that are coming into your yard. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3316.935s">So</a> then one day they'll come with a big truck and they'll drop off an excavator because they're going to dig out a foundation behind the house and they'll back the excavator into your fence, knock down the fence, leave your yard entirely exposed, and there's no regulation to require them to <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3335.117s">fix</a> that fence or put it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3336.858s">So</a> now your dog is running out into this hole in the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3340.9s">There's</a> nearly 600 children going to school on your street and they're going, they can go into the hole because it's not required to be fenced off to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3350.265s">I</a> know zoning isn't of much interest to Councilor Knight, so he stepped out. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3357.305s">Something</a> else that I found as I tried to go and see the plans for this project that are required to be available for the public to view is that I was told for three months that the plans were out being scanned. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3370.01s">So</a> there were no copies for me to view to find out what was going to be happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3374.512s">Next</a> door, they said all they knew was there was some kind of a renovation going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3379.474s">When</a> it started, they had a permit to do interior demo. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3385.357s">I</a> called the building department when two men with sledgehammers were slamming into the porches on the front of the house until the porches fell into the middle of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3395.36s">They</a> had an interior non-structural demo permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3399.861s">Someone</a> came down around three o'clock, made them stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3402.982s">By</a> 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3404.083s">the</a> next morning, the stop work order was gone and work commenced. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3408.684s">But</a> there were no plans, so there's no way to find out what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3411.905s">You</a> have 20 days to contest the plans, but there were no plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3416.525s">I</a> recently saw the plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3417.587s">I</a> saw the plans two weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3419.089s">It</a> took that long to see the plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3420.851s">Even</a> after they said they were done being scanned, they were often unavailable because they were with an inspector. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3428.06s">Then</a> I wasn't allowed to see them unless an inspector was present. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3432.831s">When</a> I finally did see them, it was with the building commissioner, Paul Moki, and I pointed out that the two plans they had, the initial site plan and the current site plan, showed that there's a two-family house on the front of the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3448.397s">The</a> new site plan showed perhaps a difference of about 10 feet to scale and included a two-family home converted to a single, a two-car garage with two floors of housing above it, and another home in the back. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3463.755s">So</a> a 160-foot lot has a 105-foot, 34-foot, 9-inch building on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3474.003s">And</a> their paperwork says their lot coverage is 20%. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3476.705s">If</a> you look at the dimensional requirements on our zoning, you're not allowed to build without a variance if you exceed 35%. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3486.112s">But</a> mathematically, it's impossible that this home is only at 20% because 160 feet <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3494.741s">105</a> feet of that is now house, and it's 30 to 35 feet wide with two driveways. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3503.427s">They</a> were able to add a second driveway without needing to get any approvals from the neighborhood, and they'll be removing two on-street parking spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3511.917s">So</a> I was very concerned, and I spoke directly to Paul Moki and asked him why they were allowed to exceed lot coverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3518.442s">I</a> still haven't gotten updated information on the lot coverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3521.824s">He</a> went out last Friday before the President's Day weekend and ordered them to stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3526.207s">He</a> took two measurements. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3528.649s">The</a> measurement that they had from the back of their new property was 67 feet, 7 and 3 quarter inches. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3536.135s">The</a> actual measurement at the job site was 55 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3541.253s">He</a> said, so that was a difference of over 12 and a half feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3545.019s">The</a> work stopped for a week and then it just started back up again. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3549.187s">So</a> some easy things that you can do to help us would be <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3555.994s">If</a> someone's going to build a house that's two to three times the size of what's already on the property, maybe a site plan review. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3563.4s">Someone</a> else could have looked at that math and said, there's no way this is 20%. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3568.183s">So</a> this permit should not have been issued. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3571.465s">They</a> should have had to go to the ZBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3573.107s">So</a> that's something that's already in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3575.068s">If</a> you could add, you know, so I'm thinking of things you could do quickly to try to improve quality of life, fencing at work zones. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3582.707s">If</a> a person or an animal had fallen into that pit, that would be tragic and could easily be avoided. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3588.852s">This</a> pit was open for several months. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3593.756s">It</a> would also be nice to have a timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3595.538s">When</a> we call and ask about the timeline, they tell us they can take as long as they want, that they can start work at 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3601.122s">every</a> single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3602.347s">work</a> for one to two hours, stop and not come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3605.27s">And</a> if you do complain about one of this gentleman's projects, he will assign someone to just hammer all day long. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3614.14s">They</a> never need to get another board. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3616.022s">They</a> never need to get more nails because their job is just to bang and make noise to punish you for reporting them. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3624.135s">If</a> we could have a requirement to maybe mitigate the dust or the debris, I do live there. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3628.479s">It's</a> not a construction zone for my family. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3631.602s">We've</a> been enduring this since May and this home is not near completion. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3637.228s">It</a> will probably go through this next summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3641.091s">Projects</a> of this length of time, it would be nice if maybe Christmas Eve or the day after Thanksgiving, they don't have to start at 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3649.718s">There</a> could be a limit to how many days they could disrupt the neighborhood in a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3655.903s">If</a> we're waiting for plans to be scanned, why can I not see the scan now? <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3663.63s">Where</a> did they scan it to? <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3666.86s">So</a> why can't I see it unless the physical plans are there? <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3670.442s">I've</a> permanently lost sunlight on the side of my yard, and I've lost the privacy in my yard, and there was no site plan review for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3679.007s">Even</a> though the site plan shows that my yard is still private, the physical building is in my backyard, overlooks my pool, and I no longer have sunlight on that side of my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3689.854s">I</a> had no rights to stop that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3691.315s">I</a> had no rights to view the plans because of the way that the ordinances are written. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3698.534s">So</a> I've had many conversations with the building inspectors and then they'd scream that and told me that this is a nice guy and he does projects all over the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3707.199s">I've</a> heard from other people all over the city that the projects that they have are exceeding 35% lot coverage there. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3713.983s">So</a> why is our building department issuing permits that are exceeding our zoning allowances and not making them go to the ZBA? <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3721.588s">It's</a> one thing for them to go to the ZBA <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3724.75s">and</a> be granted a variance, even if you disagree with it, you have the chance to be heard and say this project is larger than it's allowed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3732.914s">But</a> it's another thing for the projects to just be approved in the building department because they're skipping the variance process. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3741.484s">So</a> the most important thing about this is we're not making these sacrifices for affordable units. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3747.392s">These</a> are not affordable housing units. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3749.655s">This</a> was a two family modest size home that housed two blue collar families. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3756.412s">This</a> house was gutted and an additional house was built right in and the flippers promised me that these will be very expensive units and the quality of the neighbors will be extremely high, meaning that they'll be unaffordable for most people. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3769.543s">They're</a> gonna drive up my valuation of my home, but not the actual value of my home. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3776.233s">So</a> when you get your zoning consultant, you may want to consider that they actually, in Texas, they had a bunch of flippers that were going in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3784.116s">They</a> have a show, the Joe and Chip Gaines. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3787.837s">And</a> what they did was they were increasing the values of the homes so much and pricing the families out of their homes that they created a separate tax rate for those homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3798.241s">Because</a> those homes were, you'd have a $900,000 house next to a house that was only worth $400,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3803.683s">And</a> to increase the property value assessment on that home next door without actual being value added to that home was pricing those people out. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3814.707s">So</a> they created a separate structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3816.708s">So</a> that could be possibly a tiered option that you could look into that would, if these homes are that much greater in value, that they would bear the burden. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3827.972s">So</a> I'm hoping that there's some way that someone can look into this because I'm hitting the wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3833.855s">And</a> I'm just a resident that happens to know a lot about zoning, but this is happening to a lot of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3840.858s">And</a> the frustration of hitting the wall and seeing that your entire lifestyle is being changed beside you because someone is just <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3848.482s">building</a> a building that's blotting out the sun. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3850.603s">This</a> building is nearly as tall as the apartment buildings being built on Salem Street in a residential neighborhood next to my small single family home. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3859.206s">And</a> there was absolutely nothing I could do to stop it.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3874.668s">The</a> response that I received from him was he called later that day, he called about 12.45 on the Friday of President's Day weekend and said, I've ordered them to stop working and they won't be working again until this is resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3888.427s">As</a> I was on the phone with him, he could hear them hammering in the background, and he came out and had someone, Dennis, come out and issue a fine, but I haven't heard back since then.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3971.182s">They</a> didn't do that for us.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4041.705s">And</a> one other thing that I noticed is that they can close off your entire street and dig a trench in front of your driveway so that you can't leave your driveway, and there's no city requirement to notify you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4054.816s">So</a> they did that for four days. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4057.399s">Someone</a> came out to go to work, there was a hole in front of their driveway, and they were screaming and hollering that they couldn't go to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4064.606s">They</a> had to get a police detail, that was required by law, but notifying us that we'd be unable to access our driveways for four days. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4072.854s">Was</a> not required. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4074.575s">Also,</a> what wasn't required is they left their equipment on the street in front of a gentleman with a wheelchair's home so that he couldn't get picked up and dropped off in front of his home. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4083.657s">That</a> was left there for the weekend as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4086.618s">So</a> these are just little tiny loopholes that you would think would be common sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4091.2s">But</a> if it saves them a dollar, they're going to avoid doing.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4098.252s">Now,</a> that's not what I was told by the building commissioner's office, so they're either giving me incorrect information, they don't know the proper information, because I went directly to the building commissioner.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4120.268s">When</a> I asked the building commissioner's office when it was going to stop, if I had to have my husband park on another street for the next couple of days, they said they weren't sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4129.838s">I</a> should probably go over and ask.

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=747.321s">Hi,</a> I'm Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=751.044s">I</a> just came to, I wanted to speak about the bus two at the middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=755.888s">My</a> daughter is a sixth grader at the McGlynn, and we've had a few issues with that bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=761.433s">One</a> of the issues is the bus is at the Andrews, so the McGlynn students walk over, and last Friday in the wind and the rain, by the time they walked over, the bus was full, and the kids had to sit three and four across. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=773.823s">That</a> seems to be a regular Friday occurrence. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=776.946s">Right</a> now, the bus is slightly full during the week because the cross-country team, which has 40 members right now, they're not riding the bus on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, but I anticipate that that will become an issue at the end of the month when that season ends. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=791.864s">A</a> couple of times she's been denied access to the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=795.267s">One</a> time she was diverted to a different bus and taken on a ride to Winthrop Street to Goldilocks Bagels, at which point she was on the phone with me telling me she didn't know where she was and I could hear about six or seven other children in the background screaming, don't leave us here, we don't know where we are, don't leave us here. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=813.207s">They</a> were returned to the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=815.53s">I</a> called, I didn't know at the time that it was not going to the McGlynn, it was going to the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=820.275s">I</a> called the McGlynn and spoke to the secretary who was going to try to page Mr. Tucci, but by the time they got him, the children had been deposited at the Andrews and told that they were on their own and to walk home. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=833.332s">At</a> that point they walked across Riverside by themselves, across Salem Street by themselves to get home. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=839.636s">There</a> was a handful of kids, luckily one of them was an 8th grader, the rest of them were 6th graders who were shocked in the second week of school to find themselves walking home alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=850.002s">So</a> they've already moved one stop off of this bus to another bus because of overcrowding But it's continuing to be an issue that we've called Several times asked them to to track and monitor, but they don't ask the children to sign up which bus they're going on so It's kind of a guesstimate how many kids will be on the bus? <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=869.63s">But</a> I think when winter comes it's going to be more of an issue a couple of kids said that they're sitting on other kids laps Because they're told they can't stand, but there's nowhere for them to sit <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=878.689s">So</a> it's a real crowding issue.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=891.434s">It's</a> bus number two. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=892.515s">It</a> goes on downtown Street I've reported it to the principal a few times and I was really upset when they the couple of times that they had to walk home So, okay, so I will definitely be able to follow up with the bus company tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=905.667s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=906.167s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=906.408s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=906.748s">I</a> appreciate very much Thank you<h2><a href="../2019-09-11_OQKxfahlemU/2019-09-11_OQKxfahlemU.html">Medford School Committee meeting September 9, 2019</a></h2>
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7225.911s">Hi,</a> I'm Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7231.487s">281</a> Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7232.748s">My</a> family experienced the lottery this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7236.289s">We're</a> parents that were from the Roberts Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7240.571s">We</a> found that the lottery was not evenly split for the Roberts Elementary School because we do have the Yale Welcome Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7247.933s">Although</a> they are members of our community, they are not members who actually had integrated with our students during their time at the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7255.176s">So</a> when they split our students in half, <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7258.258s">What</a> happened was 53 students went to the Andrews, and some were in the neighborhood of the low 20s of the students that they had been in class with daily for six years went to the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7268.822s">The</a> students that went to the McGlynn found themselves to be fairly socially isolated because the majority of their friends did go to the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7276.806s">Anyone</a> who was present for the lottery when they pulled the Roberts' names saw several circles of friends, boys, girls, <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7285.009s">all</a> the students in the circle would cheer except for one, the one student who chose the McGlynn and found that they were being separated from all of their children, all of their friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7295.514s">So</a> I'm hoping that when we think about the lottery this year, that we think about while it's great that some of the equity has changed, and I'm not saying that's bad, perhaps we could have offset each of the elementary schools by five children. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7311.357s">And</a> instead of having the offset at the Roberts be close to 30 children, in that case, my daughter would have had 15 more friends at the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7321.705s">Those</a> students that are also in the low 20s are also split between two sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7326.608s">She</a> had about two friends that she socialized with that were going to the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7330.611s">And</a> one week before school started, one of the friends called her excitedly and said, yes, I got transferred to the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7339.418s">She</a> quickly went down to one friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7341.607s">Her</a> first week was really isolated. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7345.229s">There's</a> not a lot of opportunities to talk to children, and at lunch and recess, as she walked around the track, she said, a lot of the children are with the friends that they've had for years, which I had hoped for my child as I enrolled her in Medford Public Schools at the age of three, so that she would have long-lasting friendships. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7363.787s">So</a> I hope that socio-emotional will factor in this year in the lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7369.013s">I</a> know this was a unique situation for the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7372.697s">And</a> I think that it's vitally important to look at for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7377.763s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2019-03-08_qChIJ_zcV6s/2019-03-08_qChIJ_zcV6s.html">Medford School Committee meeting Wednesday, March 6, 2019</a></h2>

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3218.259s">I'm</a> Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3219.54s">I'm</a> here to present the small grant application for the Hickey Park canopy project. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3226.941s">I</a> submitted this application through our PTO in cooperation with Brian Kearns, the head of the Medford DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3234.229s">I've</a> been a resident about four houses away from this park for more than a decade. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3239.014s">I</a> walk there every day with my dog. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3241.898s">I</a> bring my daughter there to play and I look at this canopy and I say this is a <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3246.062s">This</a> is an opportunity to be something. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3248.663s">It's</a> like a promise that wasn't quite fulfilled. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3253.884s">And</a> pretty much as soon as I moved in there, I started trying to find out a way to make this something. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3260.006s">Why</a> is there a canopy over a holy hard mound of dirt and nothing else? <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3267.308s">And</a> so <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3269.602s">I</a> found that this canopy was actually donated to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3273.205s">This</a> structure is solid and will last us for decades to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3277.75s">So</a> what we really need to make this a community gathering space, this park is so well loved and used, we could put the canopy right on top of there, put a couple of picnic tables underneath, and we have a community gathering space. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3291.903s">We</a> have so many people using this park. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3294.146s">We</a> have the Roberts Elementary uses this. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3297.169s">The</a> PTO uses it for kindergarten playdates. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3299.792s">The</a> MFN is down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3301.214s">There's</a> at least two daycares that I see walking with the little tow lines down to this park almost daily. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3308.002s">We</a> had a pickleball league of seniors this summer that was there that had brought their own folding chairs to sit under the canopy, and they could have sat at a couple of picnic tables and chatted and had a light lunch. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3319.928s">The</a> baseball field, the softball field, the tennis court, almost every day there's people there, the basketball courts. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3327.192s">This</a> is a well-loved park, and what it's lacking is a place to gather in the shade and just be in your community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3337.698s">a</a> small change that would make such a huge difference in this park and it would be amazing for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3344.827s">I</a> did check in with the city, Lauren DiLorenzo and community development, the mayor's office and Brian Kearns and the DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3353.499s">There</a> are no current projects to <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3356.642s">on</a> line to change this park. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3360.184s">But</a> Brian stressed that if there were suddenly to be some grand plan that he would, this is such a strong canopy structure, that this is something they would uninstall and reinstall either here or somewhere else because this <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3374.634s">It's</a> just an amazing structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3376.436s">It's</a> very large. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3378.439s">If</a> we put two picnic tables under here, there would still be room for someone to lay out a blanket or for kids to run around. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3384.766s">This</a> is just such a huge area that I would love to see more people enjoy. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3395.003s">It's</a> kind of a small project, so I don't really know any other questions that you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3399.586s">The</a> DPW would be installing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3402.548s">They</a> would be purchasing the materials just through a catalog that we purchased. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3407.471s">They</a> would be installed. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3408.511s">They</a> would be loved and used by the community.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3421.408s">Yes,</a> the DPW would be making that a better area.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3430.051s">I</a> know they have to cement in the <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3435.102s">The</a> tables, but there's not a plan to cement the whole area. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3438.565s">But</a> they do realize that they'll have to break that up.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3450.517s">There</a> was no indications that they would uninstall it to do this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3456.158s">Does</a> the canopy need to be replaced? <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3458.079s">The</a> canopy's got some significant holes. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3460.72s">The</a> amazing thing about it is if it's had some holes for 10 years and it's still retained this much. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3466.822s">So</a> this is a canvas that pretty much the warranty is about 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3473.004s">But</a> if it's kept well, the DPW thinks it'll last much longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3478.905s">This</a> one... <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3480.626s">Had</a> holes in it a decade ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3482.43s">So</a> it's probably 15 or more years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3485.736s">So</a> it holds up pretty well It's a durable, you know heavy canvas
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3533.901s">I</a> know that this park underwent some updates to make it more ADA compliant. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3540.126s">Actually,</a> behind that area is where the handicap crosswalk is. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3544.649s">They</a> redid some of the pathways, extended them because you couldn't get from Park Street right into the park. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3552.915s">You</a> couldn't cross from Brogan <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3556.146s">to</a> get to the other side for the park. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3557.987s">It</a> was harder to access the baseball field. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3561.749s">So</a> they did do some changes there already. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3564.37s">There</a> is right in front of this is pavement. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3567.292s">So</a> I imagine if they had if they needed to put a short jaunt, that could be something that they would achieve. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3575.036s">They</a> hadn't really thought that far just <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3578.722s">What</a> can we put here to make this usable space? <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3581.145s">Because</a> I wouldn't want to sit under there now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3584.688s">I've</a> seen people put folding tables there and try to jockey them because it's not flat. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3589.233s">But</a> right now, it's pretty much unusable. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=3594.418s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2018-09-13_HY2bBQvmkEQ/2018-09-13_HY2bBQvmkEQ.html">Medford School Committee meeting September 6, 2018</a></h2>

<a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3381.824s">and</a> he rushed me out an estimate. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3384.025s">In</a> his estimate, he included extra square footage. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3387.067s">The</a> square footage that he included was 6,096 square feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3392.83s">He</a> included the installation and the materials cost at $89,681. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3399.294s">The</a> copy machine broke. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3400.315s">I</a> don't have copies for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3401.655s">I'm</a> happy to email, and I do have one extra copy that can be passed around. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3408.026s">As</a> I told the CPC when I presented my original bid, the labor cost for this project will be no more than 25% of that total price. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3414.99s">No</a> more than 25% of that total price is approximately $22,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3417.191s">$22,000</a> is $28,000 below the $50,000 labor threshold that would allow us to bypass the open bid process that has not attracted the proper people. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3437.268s">So</a> I have the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3440.369s">We</a> can use the FAC 104. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3442.91s">This</a> information is confirmed by the Attorney General's Office, the Operational Service Division, as well as DCAM, which stands for Division of Capital Asset Management and Maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3455.354s">I</a> spent more than an hour and a half on the phone today with Brian O'Donnell at the Attorney General's Office. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3461.216s">This</a> process ensures that the labor <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3467.414s">requirements</a> are met, the fair wage is paid, everything that's required under Chapter 30B is protected here. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3476.661s">I</a> beg you, before you go and ask for more money from the CPC to verify this information, I'm told that we can accept this bid and move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3489.19s">We</a> can get the full estimate <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3491.251s">and</a> move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3492.492s">We</a> don't have to ask for additional funds, we don't have to wait an additional month, and if there are more CPC funds for an additional hundred or so thousand dollars, I encourage you to do another playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3502.96s">I</a> encourage you to do something else for the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3505.862s">I</a> discourage you from paying <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3508.844s">more</a> than double the cost of this project to expedite it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3512.247s">Those</a> children deserve this project and I want them to have this project, but I do not want it to come at the cost of one single child in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3520.132s">I</a> tried to meet with people in this city to discuss this before this meeting because I do not enjoy coming down to City Hall and <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3529.973s">And</a> having to say this, I would have preferred to have come here tonight and said, thank you for getting this project underway. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3536.015s">Thank</a> you for having this happen as quickly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3539.736s">I</a> just, someone please schedule a meeting with me and I will share more of this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3545.498s">But</a> please don't spend more money than we need to on this project.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3804.255s">When</a> we initially discussed the bids and when I discussed with this vendor and before we applied with the CPC, he said that typically they prefer a landscaper or another company to do the removal because it's they don't want to send certified professional playground installation people to come out with a shovel and remove and they'll charge us much more for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3826.748s">They</a> said that they <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3827.976s">that</a> depending on the specialist you get, they can charge you $30,000, $50,000 for the removal because they really don't want to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3834.882s">And</a> one of the things that the CPC requested that I do was bring the bid down. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3839.966s">So</a> when I submitted the original price, it had with the specialist removing the product, the original product, and it was higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3848.993s">So</a> by going with a landscaper, it will be less expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3852.667s">And</a> he said when he saw the first bid that the bid was unattractive to his company because it included the removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3859.974s">He</a> did not see the second one.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3888.833s">And</a> again, he said he didn't see that bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3892.554s">I</a> did also speak to Fiona in the procurement office before the bid opened, the second bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3897.675s">And</a> I also spoke to Kirsten at the school because I went to the first contractor walkthrough. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3902.636s">where</a> zero contractors came to measure, and I said, what do we do now? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3906.878s">It</a> appears that we're not attracting any bids. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3909.478s">And</a> she said, we have bids. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3910.939s">And</a> I said, oh, we have bids? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3912.239s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3913.02s">And</a> then the next week they opened one bid, and it was in excess of $300,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3915.701s">I</a> said, if now, what do we do? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3918.342s">Well,</a> this time we reach out to vendors and try to encourage them to apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3923.083s">But</a> we have to reach out to playground vendors. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3925.294s">Because</a> this is what happens if you reach out to a general contractor. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3928.155s">The</a> general contractor says, I'm not certified to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3930.776s">You</a> know what I'm going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3931.937s">I'm</a> going to contract a playground specialist to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3935.258s">And</a> I'm going to contract him to do the entire thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3937.66s">And</a> he's going to charge me $150,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3938.94s">But</a> I want to make money, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3941.781s">So</a> he's going to charge more. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3943.382s">And</a> I don't think that chasing this down, this, my suggestion, and chase, which is not my suggestion, it's the suggestion of the Attorney General's office, and saving the city $100,000 while you can concurrently wait to go to the CPC and tell them you need more money, and if you find out that this is indeed factual, because, I'm sorry, but I don't make things up. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3964.211s">I</a> don't need to come here and embarrass myself.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3971.577s">No,</a> I talked to someone in the Attorney General's office that works with the fare wager and the construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3978.14s">So</a> he said that this Massachusetts contracts follow the prevailing wage laws.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3989.226s">You're</a> also allowed to do the bid at labor for less than a month.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4014.487s">Or</a> we could just go through the MAS contracts, the contract user guide for the FAC 104, which I'm more than willing to share with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4023.553s">learn</a> how to do it.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4027.916s">So</a> you can do the mass contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4029.217s">You</a> do not have to open the bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4030.617s">The</a> labor cost is less than $50,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4032.198s">You</a> do not have to open a bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4034.84s">You</a> can go through the mass contracts.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4149.362s">They</a> said they did not see it come up the second time. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4152.644s">I</a> was out of town. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4153.364s">I</a> didn't have time to email everyone and tell them about the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4156.085s">I</a> did actually ask Fiona to send me the information, and I did not receive an email with the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4162.313s">So</a> this was not on their radar. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4164.615s">But</a> in the handout that I gave you, there's also information on the statewide contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4168.279s">This</a> contract that I'm handing you falls into the category of statewide contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4172.523s">Who</a> may use statewide contracts? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4174.425s">Cities,</a> towns, district, counties, and other political subdivisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4178.129s">I</a> believe Medford is a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4180.531s">Buyer</a> information. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4181.492s">Why</a> would you use it? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4182.413s">Because</a> it saves time developing solicitations and issuing bids. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4187.203s">evaluating</a> responses and executing contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4190.226s">The</a> OSD has negotiated the pricing or required competitive costs, selected the appropriate vendors, and outlined the services the vendors perform relative to the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4200.454s">They</a> are subject to the Mass General Law, Chapter 30B. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4204.398s">They're</a> also subject to the wage requirements.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4215.736s">The</a> included in there is $3,000 for a rubber membrane underneath. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4219.858s">The</a> application that we submitted to the CPC also has $10,000 if we have to repair and touch up the substone. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4229.825s">It</a> also includes $12,000 for removal and disposal of rubber surfacing. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4234.908s">As</a> I said, that estimate includes labor. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4237.73s">The</a> labor is approximately 25% of that overall cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4241.511s">This</a> is not the only vendor that I've spoken to, and we got an approximate pricing for this playground.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4250.834s">I</a> attended the PTO Expo. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4253.395s">I</a> spoke to two vendors there. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4254.896s">I</a> gave them the square footage because I had it for the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4257.897s">It</a> was all around the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4260.058s">They</a> said, of course, we'd have to come out and measure and exact.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4273.27s">They're</a> registered to FAC 104 company, so they're vetted by the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4278.332s">They're</a> required to complete the prevailing wage.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4396.841s">That</a> $89,000 includes the labor. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4399.082s">They</a> do not sell the tiles without the labor because you are required to have a licensed person install the tiles. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4407.79s">That's</a> the industry standard. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4409.99s">If</a> the labor costs are below $50,000, according to the Mass General Law, Chapter 30B, which was changed in 2016, if the labor cost is under $50,000, you do not have to bid the labor. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4425.522s">The</a> labor cost will be under $25,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4427.964s">I</a> don't know if that's the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4431.587s">I</a> encourage someone to please meet with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4434.909s">I</a> will provide the name, number, <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4437.555s">of</a> the person at the Attorney General's office that I spoke to, who was chasing this down, who said that the Chapter 30B requirements require the prevailing wage, which is included in the MAS contract by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4451.525s">By</a> law.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4929.335s">If</a> I was going to do it tomorrow, I would sit down with John McLaughlin and I would say, um, I remember that you said ground masters could do the removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4937.521s">So</a> we want to get them lined up to do the removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4940.144s">We</a> also want to reach back out to, to this company that you've worked with before. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4944.767s">And</a> we want to get the itemized bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4947.069s">We</a> want it to be all laid out with the cost of the tiles. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4950.568s">the</a> cost of the installation. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4952.349s">We</a> want to know exactly how many days it's going to take. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4954.511s">We</a> want to know how long it's going to take.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4974.505s">So</a> then we would execute contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4977.427s">We</a> would begin work. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4980.238s">get</a> invoiced for the work, and the money is ready to be paid out, we would pay it out, and the children would play on a new playground, and my daughter, who's a fifth grader, would actually get to touch the new playground that we've been trying to get since she started kindergarten.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5000.017s">That's</a> who was going to do it anyway.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5088.324s">$130,000</a> to put down into locking blocks. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5090.886s">That's</a> absurd. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5092.107s">For</a> over $200,000, we could tear out the playground equipment, we could put new playground equipment in tile.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5114.322s">No,</a> that does include.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5153.274s">So</a> this bid includes... Okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5156.135s">This</a> price includes $3,000 for the rubber membrane that would go underneath the tiles.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5163.959s">Yeah,</a> so that's included in the $89,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5166.881s">So</a> if Groundmasters charges $15,000 and we needed $10,000 to replace substone underneath before we put the membrane in the tiles, we would be within $5,000 of the grant amount.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5255.695s">Of</a> course. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5256.075s">This</a> is a 24-hour turnaround. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5256.795s">Of</a> course. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5257.135s">No,</a> no, I know that.<h2><a href="../2018-05-25_gwIgYT_iFzI/2018-05-25_gwIgYT_iFzI.html">City Council Meeting 05/22/18</a></h2>

<a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3739.876s">To</a> tear down a tower that's perfectly good <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3742.652s">And</a> that right there would have saved us a million dollars that could have gone directly towards building our new fire station, but we threw that away because we apparently don't need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3751.436s">To</a> go forward with that is ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3753.517s">And</a> we see all these projects coming through. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3755.498s">Every</a> time I'm at a meeting, we see $500,000 going on Riverside Plaza to expedite it so that it could be open in the fall of 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3762.101s">And</a> if you go by, it's May of 2018, and I see mismatched furniture that looks like it came from other projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3771.322s">set</a> up there and it's still not open. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3773.223s">That's</a> $500,000 that maybe we could have cut that down and put that towards a new tower. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3779.487s">If</a> we're thinking creatively, debt exclusion is not the most creative. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3782.388s">That's</a> probably, you know, that just says, let's just take more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3785.85s">We</a> have to look at the difference going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3787.711s">Do</a> we need $1.6 million in one park when we have at least a dozen parks in 2011 that were identified in poor condition and those children will continue to play in those poor parks? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3800.088s">and</a> look over at that park that you can't park near to go and play in. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3804.511s">When</a> I visit people in that neighborhood, I often park in Tiki Island, sorry, Tiki Island, to visit friends because there's no parking on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3812.157s">So</a> we're spending money in places that we maybe need to start thinking more creatively of budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3819.022s">We</a> can't build the Taj Mahal everywhere and to tell the fire department that they can't have a station and they can't have a training tower while we're building projects at levels <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3827.925s">We</a> can't afford to maintain, we can't sustain, and we just can't afford is irresponsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3833.429s">You</a> should move to, maybe you need to spend more money on an architect and tell him he needs to build around that tower because it's irresponsible to tear down that tower. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3842.195s">The</a> million dollars that it's gonna cost to put up a new tower versus a million dollars in new architecture fees, maybe that should be the situation, and then our fire department doesn't have interrupted training schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3853.183s">Maybe</a> that's a creative solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3855.104s">I</a> think it's more creative than, <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3856.903s">Well,</a> we don't want to hold things up, so let's just knock it down and maybe we'll figure it out because the DPW, the sand and salt is coming to Mystic Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3866.388s">They've</a> already decided that that's where they want the sand and salt. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3869.73s">They</a> said that they negotiated and they sold the sign shops so that they could build a high rise of 500 units, which the firefighters will have to go into if it goes on fire, but they won't be able to train to prepare for. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3881.457s">So</a> now they want another piece of Medford land to put sand and salt on. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3885.418s">So</a> we need to think about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3886.558s">If</a> we're not going to get that land, we're going to lose that tower, and we're going to potentially lose lives.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6604.929s">Hi,</a> I'm Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6607.731s">I'm</a> here to speak on the resurfacing project for the Roberts Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6612.373s">It's</a> the second item down on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6615.295s">We're</a> very concerned about the timing of this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6617.896s">School</a> lets out on June 20th and school resumes on the last week of August. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6622.019s">This</a> project needs to be done during the school break. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6625.28s">We</a> have to go out for bidding and then schedule the work during probably the busiest time of the year, so it's gonna be very hard for us to schedule one week <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6633.738s">could</a> mean that the children have to wait an extra year for this project, so I'm hoping that perhaps an exception can be made and this project can be approved this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6641.262s">I</a> can answer any questions that anyone has. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6648.605s">We</a> have photographs of the project as well.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6688.366s">I</a> am the-.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6924.348s">And</a> I just want to interject that this board council has already approved an off-cycle application. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6930.871s">We're</a> not an off-cycle application. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6932.692s">I</a> submitted the application on January 5th, the initial application. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6936.313s">Then</a> I submitted the full application the first week of March. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6940.202s">I've</a> been to several meetings for the CPA and presented this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6944.303s">I've</a> been to meetings at the school committee to present this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6947.463s">I've</a> been to subcommittee meetings of the school committee to submit this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6952.404s">I</a> prepared the 65-page application for this project, collected signatures and support for this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6958.645s">So</a> I am more than capable of answering any questions that you have on this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6963.386s">And</a> I think that I'm more than happy to come tomorrow if you have additional questions and answer it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6970.02s">but</a> this project is very time sensitive, and to tell these children that they could possibly have to wait an additional year for the largest elementary school in the city with the English language learner program, the autism program, this would break a lot of hearts. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6984.085s">So</a> please, I ask you to consider us.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7011.4s">I've</a> gotten conflicting answers on this, but I'm told that until the money is approved by this council, they won't prepare the bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7018.483s">I</a> spoke to Cassandra in engineering today. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7020.364s">She</a> said it could take 45 days for the bid and that has to be advertised for two weeks, I was told by the procurement office. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7027.267s">So</a> we're really pushing up against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7029.588s">And</a> just getting in the schedules of these people once we do go through that process could really push us up to the end of the summer.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7040.694s">The</a> actual work is projected to take between five and 10 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7044.116s">Five</a> and 10 days, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7045.097s">And</a> we were asked to make our application smaller just because this is only for the surfacing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7050.42s">There's</a> not a bench or a flower in this application. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7053.962s">So</a> we actually need a landscaper to do removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7056.51s">And</a> then we need a playground specialist to do the installation because we were told there's very limited funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7063.377s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7294.873s">We're</a> concerned that the city is not going to move forward in preparing the bid until this money is allocated. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7301.425s">We're</a> talking about waiting until after Memorial Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7303.506s">It'll</a> be less than a month before school lets out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7306.488s">So</a> if we do a 45-day bid, we're talking about sometime in July when the bid will end, and then we have to try to get on the schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7312.852s">We'll</a> need to be on the schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7314.793s">We'll</a> probably have about a 35-day window, less than that, actually, because we need to allocate 10 days to do the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7321.277s">So</a> we'll have 25 days to get on the schedule of the chosen bid to do the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7327.461s">So</a> seven days could be, <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7331.133s">the</a> difference between doing it now and saying, do you have any time in July of 2019? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7339.296s">So</a> that's an entire year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7343.277s">Or</a> the kids go back to school, and there's caution tape and construction vehicles, which would complement the construction on the corner of Court Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7353.44s">So</a> we really don't want to disrupt the children's recess time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7357.541s">It's</a> a very coveted time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7360.392s">well</a> utilized in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7362.093s">It's</a> the only playground that has, the school playground has lighting at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7366.135s">The</a> neighborhood children play there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7367.456s">You'll</a> often see children there till 8 or 9 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7370.297s">because</a> it's a lit area. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7372.298s">Hickey</a> Park is down the street, but it's pitch dark. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7374.919s">It's</a> not able to be used by the neighbors at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7379.082s">So</a> it's a difference between now, it could be a difference between now and a year.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7416.58s">It's</a> already been signed by the mayor.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7470.609s">I</a> understand that if there's controversy with papers tomorrow, that perhaps these papers will stay in committee for a week or two longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7478.275s">We</a> could be talking about June before this is approved?
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7495.429s">And</a> will this be voted on as a whole tomorrow, or will there be possibility of parcelization? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7500.113s">I'm</a> just trying to find out what's going to happen.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7692.066s">And</a> the great thing about doing it in the summer is that it's light out till 8.30 at night, so they'll have a playground a couple of blocks away. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7699.828s">If</a> we wait until the fall, when it starts getting dark at 4.30, 5 o'clock, there'll be nothing.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7739.587s">I</a> hope, if nothing else, that I've expressed the urgency of this project so that if this paper gets bogged down tomorrow, perhaps you would consider not punishing 550 plus school children and letting this project move forward.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7780.968s">point</a> of clarification, what I actually said was I hope that if this paper gets bogged down tomorrow with other issues, that it's not delayed and what will happen is the children will be punished. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7793.975s">It's</a> an unintended consequence, so that's just why we're here, to make sure that you're aware that that's a possibility, and we hope that you'll consider and think about that.<h2><a href="../2018-04-26_I5lIrWN8Vh8/2018-04-26_I5lIrWN8Vh8.html">Community Preservation Committee Meeting 04/24/18</a></h2>
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=24.585s">April</a> 24th.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=178.625s">Okay,</a> so hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=180.467s">I'm</a> representing the Roberts PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=183.99s">We</a> put in our application for the surfacing of our playground to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=188.874s">The</a> surface of the playground was put in around 2003 when the school opened, and it was slated to last for eight to 10 years, so now it's past replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=199.543s">I</a> brought the actual pictures if it's easier for the committee to look at, thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=206.349s">So</a> we're at a point where this is poor in place and they've been trying to patch, but this is what it looks like today. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=213.825s">Close</a> to 600 students play on this playground every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=217.206s">We're</a> the largest elementary school in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=219.807s">So</a> this is very well utilized. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=222.128s">Just</a> today on this beautiful day when I went to pick up my daughter, there were probably 30 to 40 younger siblings playing on the playground before dismissal and easily 200 after school. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=232.032s">So</a> this is a well-loved and utilized playground to the point that when I went to get my pictures, I could not find a day to take a picture where there wasn't a family playing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=241.355s">So</a> we're just hoping to have the surfacing done. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=243.777s">We</a> made this application as lean as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=246.199s">We</a> haven't asked for anything other than the surfacing. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=249.522s">The</a> playground equipment was inspected and found to be <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=253.327s">fine</a> and can continue to be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=255.408s">We</a> haven't asked for a bench or a planting. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=257.128s">We've</a> only asked for the surfacing. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=259.229s">We</a> picked rubber interlocking tile, which needs to be professionally installed. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=264.13s">The</a> reason we picked that is because it has zero maintenance requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=267.572s">So</a> this won't happen again. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=268.732s">We</a> won't have the holes. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=270.572s">It'll</a> be just like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=271.513s">So</a> if there is damage to a tile, a tile can be replaced singly. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=276.24s">And</a> it'll look like this for the next 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=280.388s">So</a> it's really a great product. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=282.632s">It's</a> extremely safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=284.516s">And</a> we're excited to have a new playground.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=313.223s">It's</a> open to the public outside of the school day. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=316.004s">So</a> during the school day, it's just the students, but outside of the school day, in the summer, on the weekends, at night, it's very well used. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=323.987s">Can</a> I make a comment on it?
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=336.792s">Yes,</a> it is lit.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=378.723s">Well,</a> I started trying to find funding for this project when my daughter was in kindergarten. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=384.686s">My</a> daughter is now a fourth grader, so yay, we're hoping she's going to get that one more year at the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=390.85s">I</a> was told that I could fundraise the money if I had wanted to, and our PTO was not in a position to raise $100,000 extra. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=401.115s">We</a> do provide a lot of funding for the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=402.916s">We</a> do enrichment nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=404.784s">We're</a> preparing for field day. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=405.985s">We</a> buy t-shirts for all the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=407.386s">We</a> have entertainment, snacks. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=410.649s">We</a> do the book fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=412.27s">We</a> buy books for the library, books for the teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=415.433s">We</a> buy school supplies at the beginning of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=417.514s">We</a> do in-school enrichment. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=418.835s">We</a> pay for buses for field trips. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=420.577s">So</a> we're around $25,000 in expenses a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=424.92s">And</a> it's a very dynamic and involved group that helps to raise these funds and we're very fortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=431.664s">But</a> $100,000 we would be raising for the next probably 20 years because we still have to provide that core amount of funding every year.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=448.915s">Right,</a> this project has to go out to bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=450.596s">Unfortunately,</a> I tried to make the application leaner by saying, oh, can we do the demo? <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=455.218s">Because</a> that was around $30,000 just for the demo. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=458.68s">We</a> were able to talk to the playground company, and they said if we hired a landscaper, that would be half the cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=465.763s">So</a> that's how we took out some there, and they said by having it professionally done, it could decrease the amount of repair we have to do to the substructure when we take it out, but it has to be done by hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=476.53s">It</a> cannot be done with a machine, unfortunately. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=480.413s">So,</a> yeah, unfortunately, because it's city land, we cannot just have volunteers go in there and tear it out and put it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=486.817s">And</a> because of the intricacy of the installation, it has to be professionally done.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=511.896s">I</a> like to be in control, so I hope to leave this meeting and speak to the Building and Grounds Subcommittee and say, we really want to be on the ground the day after, if we make it through this round, the day after the City Council hears this, we want the bid to go out immediately and do it as quickly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=530.963s">They</a> told us it was five to ten days of construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=534.484s">We</a> would not want to do it in September, it would be very sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=538.471s">But</a> we really do want to have this done as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=541.133s">We</a> have another project where we're going to be painting the rainbow outside the school, so we want this to be a fabulous start to the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=552.684s">And</a> I do have a school committee member with me, Aaron DeBenedetto.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=734.872s">So</a> our estimate includes $10,000 in repair to the substrate so hopefully it'll be less but they said they did that on the high side so that we wouldn't have a surprise coming in.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=752.367s">They</a> actually said they can do it without removing any of the equipment, which is amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=755.948s">And</a> I'll be down there watching them do it, because there's a lot of equipment there. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=760.23s">And</a> they're going to install the tiles one by one and cut each one to fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=766.173s">So</a> we're getting a really custom product here.<h2><a href="../2018-04-10_vqZ0fsWQ1g0/2018-04-10_vqZ0fsWQ1g0.html">Medford School Committee meeting April 9, 2018</a></h2>
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3382.676s">We'll</a> get a report on that one, I'm sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3385.299s">That's</a> April 24th, the CPA presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3388.561s">But</a> yeah, Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3392.244s">I</a> just wanted to bring up the topic of bullying. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3396.068s">I</a> noticed that as the children get older, there's a little buzz here.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3420.282s">It's</a> on. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3421.984s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3422.365s">So</a> I just wanted to come in and bring up the topic of bullying. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3425.809s">I've</a> noticed that as <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3428.625s">As</a> technology gets more prolific, bullying seems to get more severe. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3434.026s">When</a> I was a child, if there was a bully, they were at school and maybe on the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3438.647s">But</a> when you got home, you were safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3440.787s">And</a> now it seems that bullying has extended beyond the school, schoolyard, buses, to your homes if your child is on any kind of social media, texting app, anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3457.4s">Even</a> as a parent of a 22 year old, I didn't have to deal with this and I'm finding it difficult and I'm hoping that the school will be willing to implement some kind of a program, maybe something that the PTOs can help work with or we can work with the computer teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3475.16s">the</a> district works with the Michigan model and when I looked them up I found they have a bully free school circle of support type of program. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3484.083s">I</a> think what's really important in this type of program would be not only to do the principals, the teachers, the students, but also the parents because we're in a position where we don't exactly know <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3496.412s">how</a> to guide our children, and if we're not guiding all the children in the same direction, it's great to tell your child to block somebody else, but if they then go on someone else's page and start harassing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3509.643s">We</a> had a situation in my particular family, and I put a post on Facebook, and I was amazed at how many messages that I got from friends from different schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3519.01s">It's</a> not a Medford unique problem, <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3523.262s">Things</a> like that they had bullying and they went to their principal for help and the principal told them, you know, boys will be boys or it's your turn to get bullying. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3532.062s">Children</a> that were getting bullied so badly in their schools that they were going online and saying that they were going to commit suicide, or students that were harassed so heavily that they were scratching themselves or cutting themselves as young as elementary school. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3549.354s">So</a> I'm really concerned about this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3551.856s">It's</a> touched my family personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3553.997s">One</a> of those stories is about someone in my family. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3558.395s">but</a> I prefer not to say which one. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3561.356s">So</a> I'm hoping that we can have some kind of collaboration. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3563.778s">I</a> know that right now, most of our bullying issues go through either the adjustment Councilor or the principal, and maybe it's not working for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3574.343s">I</a> know that the issue that we were having personally had gone through the adjustment Councilor, and we didn't hear about it for a couple weeks later after a student reported an issue <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3587.682s">My</a> daughter wasn't spoken to for two additional weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3590.843s">And</a> if that had escalated, that could have been a really serious problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3594.865s">So</a> I'm hoping that maybe we can set up a committee that has parents on it, or you can have a subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3600.907s">But</a> bullying is something that we, anyone that was at that five hour meeting or watched it on television, probably about half of the people that spoke at that meeting talked about relentless bullying that their students were going through, their children. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3613.052s">So</a> I really just wanted to come here and say that I hope that <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3617.25s">when</a> you go to hire a new superintendent, maybe that's a question of what they want to do about bullying, and we can do something about it, because I need help.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3637.944s">This</a> was just the bully-free school circle of support. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3641.566s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3642.227s">And</a> it just emphasized that you had to have people at all levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3646.81s">They</a> had training for the teachers, but they also had training for the parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3650.392s">This</a> was on their website. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3651.993s">I</a> just have one copy that you can have.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3656.796s">Yeah,</a> I can email it to you.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3670.944s">I</a> think it's all around. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3672.104s">I</a> think kids are treating each other horribly. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3676.325s">The</a> only reason I suggested a committee is that maybe if a student doesn't feel comfortable talking to their principal, or doesn't have a relationship with that adjustment Councilor, or if the parents have told me that they've gone to the principal and they've hit the wall and they don't know where to go next, so I'm hoping that we can set up the next step. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3694.494s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3694.674s">Vander</a> Kloop.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4271.015s">Sure,</a> and I just while we wait for him to walk up, I want to make one point is I didn't come here to be like let's take all the bullies and suspend them out of the school because I think the issue is a lot more complicated than punishing the bully. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4282.763s">I'd</a> like more education around the socio and emotional about how to treat each other and that just because you're mad at your friend doesn't mean you <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4290.29s">relentlessly</a> torture them, and then three days later, they're best friends again, but they've done damage to each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4295.371s">So</a> I just want to point that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4296.271s">Thank</a> you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4296.831s">Rodriguez.</a> <h2><a href="../2018-02-06_XMHnwGJ5osA/2018-02-06_XMHnwGJ5osA.html">Medford School Committee February 5, 2018</a></h2>
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5332.996s">Hi,</a> Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5335.658s">So</a> yeah, I went to the subcommittee meeting last week, and Mr. John McLaughlin from the Buildings and Grounds had given us an estimate. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5343.924s">I</a> ended up reaching out to that person. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5345.865s">During</a> the course of the meeting, it was suggested by Mr. Belson that perhaps rubber tiles would be better. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5351.869s">I</a> spoke to him on the phone, and the rubber tiles are far more durable. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5355.531s">They'll</a> last us probably close to 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5358.113s">They</a> require zero maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5359.753s">If</a> we get the pour in place, if we want it to last about 12 years, we would need to invest about $10,000 five to seven years in to reseal it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5370.835s">And</a> it's cheaper to actually get the rubber tiles. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5373.096s">The</a> estimate was around $85,000 as opposed to $92,000, so it would save money. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5378.157s">The</a> playground apparatus doesn't need to come out, and as was discussed, the playground apparatus is right now in very good shape compared to the <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5386.709s">to</a> the surfacing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5390.03s">The</a> man also suggested, I believe his name was Travis, that we could lower the cost of the estimate by having a landscaping company, or maybe we had people within the city that would be able to take out the old rubber surfacing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5402.754s">Their</a> estimate for that was $25,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5405.175s">He</a> said that was because he had high-level professionals that do the playgrounds coming in to do that, and it was something that he said could be done with a shovel that a landscaper would know how to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5416.402s">And</a> they would probably give us an estimate of $10,000 to $12,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5420.068s">Possibly</a> we could even get that lower if we had a resource in the community or someone that we could reach out to. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5428.017s">If</a> the substone is in good shape, that $10,000 that was put in for that could go down or be eliminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5434.801s">So</a> the goal for us right now is to try to make our application as lean as possible, show as much community support as we can, which would include things like getting workers in the community to help us out. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5447.988s">And</a> if the city was able, if there is a line item coming up in our budget for other playground services, if we combined more than one estimate, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5457.253s">we</a> would save additional $1 to $2 per square foot, which just for the Roberts playground would be anywhere from $5,400 to $11,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5467.061s">So</a> it could make a significant difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5470.323s">I'm</a> hoping that someone in the committee or the mayor is interested in helping work towards this application. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5479.17s">I</a> am, again, just a <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5480.528s">a</a> parent volunteer, trying to do the best that I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5483.23s">I'm</a> hoping that the Roberts can serve as the model and the first step, and we can get the other schools in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5489.034s">I</a> know that the other schools do need this done as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5493.457s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5495.338s">And</a> the meeting, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5496.459s">The</a> meeting is, we're meeting with the commission for the community preservation on February 13th. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5502.183s">Our</a> meeting is at 7.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5503.804s">It's</a> an open meeting, but we don't have a room. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5505.545s">It's</a> here at City Hall.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5668.894s">It</a> was it was a seven foot fall height Which was the exact same as the estimate that mr. McLaughlin had presented for the park.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5681.103s">It</a> can't be done by farm equipment He said it has to be done by shovels because we don't want to destroy the substone So that was why the estimate was so high from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5690.63s">Yeah,</a> it's manual labor manual labor. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5693.072s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5693.432s">I</a>

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=953.837s">And</a> we used money from the Jingle Bell Festival to cover the rest of that cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=958.928s">We</a> made, I don't have the exact figure, but it's a little under $7,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=961.774s">We</a> were the number one school this year.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=965.481s">So</a> that was great for them too. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=969.256s">So</a> today I'm here to ask for support and help for the Roberts PTO's grant application to the Community Preservation Commission for the restoration of our school playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=978.685s">The</a> Roberts Elementary School is one of the most populous elementary schools in Medford and our playground, as are all the elementary school playgrounds, is in need of replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=987.413s">The</a> worst item in all our playgrounds seems to be the surfacing. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=990.954s">So</a> I applied for this grant for a few reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=993.735s">One</a> was that I saw the mayor's capital improvement plan at a city council meeting, and it included line items to replace one school playground per year, which was great. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1003.04s">And</a> I thought if we coupled it with community preservation money, we could replace two playgrounds per year, and everyone could have a new playground in two to three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1012.025s">So</a> that would be about 2,400 students in our elementary schools that would all have a shiny new playground to play in. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1018.598s">So</a> that benefit would radiate out through the neighborhood that each school is in, because it will allow their family members of the students to enjoy the playgrounds as well as people that just live in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1029.321s">We've</a> gone through the eligibility phase, and we now have to prepare a complete application. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1036.123s">So</a> we don't know exactly how much it's going to cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1039.544s">And</a> we need help from the district in order to <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1042.966s">figure</a> out the parameters of what you'll require, companies that we have to go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1047.429s">This</a> is outside of my scope of expertise, as well as my authority as a parent volunteer at the Roberts Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1054.775s">We</a> were able to apply with a supporting letter from the principal at our school. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1059.799s">But</a> in order to go forward, we need approval and help from <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1064.077s">the</a> school committee and the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1066.219s">So</a> I'm hoping that we're going to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1069.081s">The</a> application needs to be submitted by March 2nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1072.764s">I'm</a> hoping that we'll make it through the first round because that will allow for completion to happen in the summer when the students are not in school so that they won't have any interrupted recess time and they'll be able to start September with a shiny new playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1085.919s">If</a> we do receive community preservation funds, there are other grants that we can apply for to help supplement, but we're not eligible to apply for those grants until we receive funding from the community preservation. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1100.126s">So</a> I'm hoping that you guys can help me out.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4411.348s">Hi,</a> I'm Cheryl Rodriguez again, 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4414.429s">I</a> am an active member of my PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4417.19s">No</a> one personally approached me, but I can tell you that my PTO sends constant flyers. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4423.412s">They</a> have events almost monthly. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4425.653s">Every</a> PTO does this. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4427.073s">We</a> have Facebook pages. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4429.034s">Some</a> of us have Twitter accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4431.415s">We</a> make every effort to have people join. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4433.916s">I'm</a> not a board member on a PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4435.757s">I</a> went to a PTO meeting and I raised my hand and volunteered. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4440.568s">I've</a> added programming to my PTO on a voluntary basis, and people do the best that they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4447.358s">I've</a> gone to meetings where there's been three people, and I know for a fact that a flyer's gone out, that a flyer's been on the window at the school, that we've posted it on our Facebook page. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4457.406s">And</a> there's three people there. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4459.107s">And</a> that's not because we're not engaging our community, because we have signs up at every event that things are going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4464.849s">We</a> send out emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4466.65s">There's</a> only so much that you can do, but you have to be realistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4470.011s">When</a> I had my first child, I worked full time, and I did not volunteer at the PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4474.053s">I</a> did not have the time or the bandwidth. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4476.134s">I'm</a> lucky now that I can and I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4478.715s">And</a> I appreciate that a lot of people are not able to do that, and I don't think <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4483.157s">that</a> we should be disparaging people on either side, people that do have the time to volunteer, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4487.681s">People</a> that don't, you know, that's fine too. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4490.363s">We're</a> here for all of the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4491.944s">We</a> do fundraising for every child. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4494.666s">in</a> all the schools, and we're not singling out and go, oh, Johnny's mother didn't help, so he doesn't get a t-shirt on field day. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4500.608s">So</a> I think we need to remember that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4502.469s">And</a> I hope that some of your recommendations will include ways to help some of our PTOs, especially those of us that are in high needs districts, high needs areas, where our parents do work two jobs, or our parents don't speak English, or they have special needs children they have to attend to, or they have three or four children, and packing those kids up and coming to a PTO meeting is impossible. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4523.857s">We</a> even tried to do our meetings on Facebook Live. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4526.897s">And</a> it didn't increase our attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4530.058s">So</a> we're all doing the best that we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4532.219s">And</a> I hope that the district is able to help us. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4535.019s">Because</a> from year to year, some PTOs find that it's really hard for them to afford that $8,000 to $10,000 that we need for the buses, or that field day event, or that in-school enrichment. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4545.623s">And</a> we do the best that we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4547.343s">Sometimes</a> you run a fundraiser, and you think you're going to make $1,000, and you make $500. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4550.804s">And</a> you have to add another fundraiser on the fly, because you're not going to cover those bills at the end of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4557.401s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2017-12-13_qZO7pLjaumo/2017-12-13_qZO7pLjaumo.html">Medford, MA City Council - Dec. 12, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=2661.549s">Hi,</a> I'm Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=2662.61s">I</a> live at 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=2666.192s">I'm</a> always in favor of expanded notification, and I think I like the part in here about the text message or the phone call. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=2672.876s">As</a> we all know, reverse 9-1-1 calls cost pennies. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=2676.559s">So</a> if you ask someone to make 400 reverse 9-1-1 calls, we're talking about $4 to $10, which I don't think is exorbitant. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=2686.065s">And</a> then 400 neighbors get to get notification of a project. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=2689.727s">I</a> think that any project that is adding a housing unit, there should be an expanded notification because if you live next door to a single family and it's going to be a two or a three, that's going to be a big difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=2703.114s">If</a> you live half a block down from that house, that's going to be a big difference on your street. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=2707.396s">A</a> lot of us lives on streets where parking is difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=2711.538s">We</a> face the <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=2713.079s">Every</a> time there's a snow emergency, it's where am I going to put my car? <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=2716.361s">If</a> you start adding housing units onto streets, people are going to want to have input onto whether or not there's going to be parking, because that's the most common variance that's granted when these units are added.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=2734.692s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=2735.652s">So</a> I think that we should just strive for more notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=2738.873s">I</a> would love to see the agendas for the zoning board on the front page of the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=2744.854s">I</a> would love to see them read here at meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=2747.955s">We</a> really need to find a way for people to know because we're chasing these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=2751.976s">I</a> was at the building department last week and I asked them if there was a way for me to find out about permit refusals because the most common question that people are asking online about zoning is how do we find out about these projects before they get to the ZBA? <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=2764.038s">because</a> once they get there, it feels too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=2766.339s">Currently,</a> unless you know the address of a project that's received a permit refusal, you cannot find out what the permit refusals are in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=2773.763s">So</a> that's an obstacle that we have to face and that we're chasing down as we're seeing more and more units. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=2779.387s">We're</a> seeing zoning ordinances being written by our mayor and I'm very concerned as are many, many of our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=2787.031s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=2787.391s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2017-11-22_W1Pcx_tDASA/2017-11-22_W1Pcx_tDASA.html">Medford, MA City Council - Nov. 21, 2017 [Livestream] (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=652.33s">Hi,</a> Cheryl Rodriguez, 21 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=654.715s">Thanks</a> for taking me. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=655.937s">I'm</a> having a little bronchitis, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=660.223s">So</a> I just wanted to start with a notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=662.904s">If</a> you live on or near Bellevue Street, Capon Street, Fairmont Street, University Avenue, or Winthrop Street, please be advised that Tufts University intends to convert these properties there into dormitories. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=673.525s">I</a> have no further details on this project and have just heard about them. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=678.346s">The</a> ZBA meeting for their variances is on Monday, December 4th at 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=682.407s">here</a> in Council Chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=684.327s">Unless</a> you are an abutter or an abutter to an abutter, you will not be notified of this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=691.229s">Sadly,</a> I'm here again to speak on the gross negligence of our Zoning Board of Appeals with regards to the 87 Medford Street Project. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=698.011s">After</a> the October 25th meeting, I and another resident filed a complaint with the Attorney General for violation of open meeting laws and not allowing residents to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=707.494s">Two</a> subsequent complaints were filed after the November 13th meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=712.276s">I</a> also included in my complaint that our Zoning Board members seem to not understand what their job and limitations are. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=718.918s">They</a> are not permitted to create new zoning laws on a parcel-by-parcel basis through variances, which is essentially spot zoning, and frankly are not allowed to create new zoning laws at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=729.037s">That</a> is the job of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=732.297s">In</a> the presence of dozens of residents and four sitting city councilors, a member of the ZBA in October stated that the board was forced to grant illegal variances because the Medford City Council has not changed zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=743.723s">That's</a> not true, and I again ask this council to set the record straight that this is not in their purview. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=749.426s">Variances</a> should be rare and only under legally allowed conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=754.468s">These</a> developers time and time again express surprise when they meet resistance to their projects as they say they are being encouraged by the administration to build denser. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=763.477s">This</a> council needs to find out where that message is coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=766.059s">Is</a> it the Office of Community Development? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=767.861s">Whoever</a> it is, why are they encouraging developers to ignore zoning laws? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=772.305s">Because</a> projects with nine plus variances aren't bending zoning laws, they're pretending they don't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=779.362s">According</a> to the Medford Zoning Ordinances, Chapter 94, Section 173, entitled General Dimensional Requirements, Table 6.3, titled Table of Dimensional Requirements, this project is so grossly outsized for the property provided that it was illegal for it to have passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=796.682s">A</a> multi-dwelling, which is as close as this mixed use which is not allowed, requires 10,000 square feet to start, 4,500 square feet for the first two units, then 1,000 square feet for each additional unit on floors one through three, 600 square feet for each unit on floors four and above. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=814.314s">By</a> this math, the size of the property is about 45,000 square feet and they're only legally permitted to build 32 units as the housing doesn't begin until the second level. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=823.62s">If</a> the housing began at the first level, they would only be allowed to build 31. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=826.561s">The</a> project approved was 55. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=830.441s">Let</a> that sink in. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=831.721s">A</a> full 23 units over allowable density if this project was legally allowed to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=837.762s">To</a> put that into perspective, the developer threatened if this project didn't go through, he would build a 40B there. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=844.163s">I</a> counted that a 40B might be smaller. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=847.024s">40B</a> projects would also provide 25% affordable units instead of the six provided here. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=853.045s">but</a> they are legally allowed to go outside the zoning laws, but likely not as far as this. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=858.209s">Even</a> though this project is illegal for the sake of argument, even 30% outside of our zoning of 40B would only be 42 units, with at least 10 of those units being affordable, still 13 less than were legally approved by our zoning board. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=872.862s">That</a> evidence removes all arguments that this is done to increase affordable housing because it adds 49 luxury price units and only six affordable units. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=882.53s">This</a> is a density project and nothing more. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=885.273s">The</a> approval of the project was illegal. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=887.355s">It</a> shows a fundamental lack of understanding of our zoning laws and the boundaries of the powers of the ZBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=893.48s">It</a> also runs contrary to the reasons that they stated for breaking our zoning laws without remorse. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=899.625s">The</a> entire board should be removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=901.367s">The</a> decision should be immediately overturned. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=903.689s">When</a> a new board is installed, they should be made to watch the open meeting law tapes the Attorney General ordered the board to watch after their last violation of open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=913.279s">They</a> should also be made to read Massachusetts General Law section 40A, paying particular attention to section 10 entitled variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=921.688s">These</a> are the only way that this board can legally grant variances, not based on a density agenda, not based on the will of the administration, and definitely not because they feel responsible for solving the greater Boston housing crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=937.763s">Yesterday,</a> the meeting of the open meeting law complaints was held by the ZBA at 8.45 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=943.328s">The</a> board affirmed that they feel they are fighting against this council for a greater good. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=948.3s">It</a> was again stated that they are forced to grant variances because this council has an updated zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=954.261s">Further,</a> it was said that even if this council asks them to expand who they notify for projects, they will refuse to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=962.383s">They</a> said they will follow the letter of the Massachusetts law and only notify abutters to abutters within 300 feet and only residents directly across the street from the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=973.426s">One</a> of the complainants was from a resident who was across the street from the project and one house over. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=978.853s">She</a> complained that she was not notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=981.015s">The</a> ZBA says they are under no obligation to notify her and will not notify people similarly in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=989.105s">This</a> project will impact her as much as her next door neighbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=992.789s">This</a> was highlighted and they asked Solicitor Rumley to back them in this interpretation of the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=998.993s">This</a> board has consulted with our city solicitor and has made it clear that they intend to do the minimum and will not do more even if an ordinance is passed by this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1008.98s">The</a> time has passed to talk here at meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1010.921s">This</a> is happening and accelerating quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1013.363s">We</a> have a ZBA that is moving to increase density through variances and refusing to be checked other than through the filing of court cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1022.587s">I</a> asked Solicitor Rumley if there was a board I could appeal to that would help, since the ZBA is going outside of zoning and refusing to follow the laws on granting variances, and he angrily told me to hire an attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1035.371s">Apparently</a> that is our only recourse. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1037.992s">But</a> you need to do it quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1039.212s">This</a> last illegal approval allowed density that was 70% more than what is allowed for a parcel of this size in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1049.888s">It</a> provides zero setbacks. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1053.39s">Even</a> if zoning was completely modified tomorrow, it is doubtful that a project like this would have been allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1060.154s">If</a> you update zoning to allow more density and the ZBA still feels that it isn't dense enough, we'll stop them from approving projects 70% over what you make in the new laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1072.693s">You've</a> lost complete control of our zoning laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1075.696s">The</a> time to play nice is over. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1078.098s">Our</a> ZBA is doing as they see fit with regard to zoning laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1081.722s">Our</a> Mayor is meeting with people behind closed doors to write zoning laws the way she wants them to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1087.428s">Where</a> is the City Council in this conversation? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1089.93s">Where</a> is the resident input? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1092.083s">This</a> is your area. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1093.204s">This</a> is under your control. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1095.006s">You</a> have far more power than to make a speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1097.668s">Please</a> use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1098.829s">The</a> residents are counting on you. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1101.011s">You</a> saw that the ZBA only allowed you to speak at the Medford Street Project in October. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1106.156s">And</a> all that you spoke was to say to let the residents speak, which they did not. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1110.54s">You</a> need to speak for us now. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1112.863s">In</a> 18 months, it will be too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1115.545s">You've</a> all retained your seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1117.225s">You</a> can all start the work now. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1119.386s">I</a> encourage you to retain an attorney versus loaning laws to help you with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1123.687s">Not</a> just a group that's charged with increasing density in cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1127.768s">You</a> need to reign in this board. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1129.548s">You</a> need to take control. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1131.648s">What</a> are you going to do about this project? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1133.529s">It's</a> now passed and the only way to stop it is to file a lawsuit. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1137.63s">Is</a> that how it's going to work here in Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1140.473s">Either</a> you stop gross overreach or the city continues to sue itself over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1145.006s">Thanks.</a> <h2><a href="../2017-10-31_hcZI56w1erc/2017-10-31_hcZI56w1erc.html">Medford, MA City Council - Oct. 31, 2017 [Livestream] (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4264.569s">Hi,</a> I'm Cheryl Rodriguez from 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4268.214s">Thanks</a> to everyone who was waiting to speak on this that stuck around. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4272.759s">I</a> wanted to talk about the Zoning Board meeting that happened on Tuesday, October 24th. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4276.304s">It</a> was actually a continuation of the meeting that happened on September 26th. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4282.403s">I</a> think it's important to note that it was a continuation from that date There was a City Council meeting on that date that was held at the Medford High School So anyone who had business with City Council or city councilors were unable to attend that meeting so <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4297.147s">A</a> Somerville alderman, I'm going to ruin this name, but Nader Gang was there and he requested that the hearing be postponed so that his constituents could be informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4307.452s">I</a> heard through the grapevine that there was a meeting being held by this alderman, which was also on the night of a city council meeting, but he's from Somerville, so he's under no obligation to meet around you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4320.078s">I</a> attended that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4321.238s">There</a> were about a hundred people in attendance at that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4327.232s">And</a> a lot of concerns were brought up that I didn't think were mentioned at the October meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4332.557s">Since</a> only the elected officials were able to speak, we entrusted the sum of all the men to give us the information that transpired at that meeting, and we didn't hear from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4344.107s">The</a> biggest thing that the people were talking about is that we want open and transparent government, and the number one way for us to get that is to have open meetings with public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4353.989s">When</a> the meeting started, we were in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4355.93s">I</a> was in the front row. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4356.87s">The</a> room was filled. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4357.71s">There</a> were at least 20 people in the hallway. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4359.45s">The</a> room was too small. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4360.851s">City</a> councilors came in and advised that the chambers were available and that we could move the meeting to that room. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4366.652s">The</a> chairman at that point said that he was very comfortable where he was, didn't want to move. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4371.094s">There</a> was a lot of dissent in the room at that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4374.715s">I</a> said, gee, it seems like if a bigger room is available, it may be a violation to deny people the opportunity to be present for a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4382.877s">that</a> they have concerns for. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4384.918s">That</a> meeting was then moved into this room. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4387.8s">All</a> of the props that were shown were facing away from the audience, the people in the gallery. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4395.844s">The</a> Somerville alderman spoke and said that $33,000 in traffic mitigation had been offered to Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4403.789s">But</a> he didn't mention that there were a lot of issues about parking in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4407.412s">The</a> plan that we presented in Somerville was that overflow parking would be in a public parking lot that was across the street from the development. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4415.88s">And</a> many of the Somerville neighbors were upset because when they have the snow emergency parking, they rely on that parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4422.466s">And</a> they felt that 10 guest spots that also combined as commercial spots were not sufficient and would give them issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4429.208s">There</a> were also issues from Somerville and Medford residents that that area frequently floods when it rains. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4436.549s">There</a> was nothing brought up about that being changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4440.63s">And</a> when asked about loss of water pressure, about strains on utilities, we were told that that was okay because they were gonna hook into Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4449.916s">When</a> they asked about the front door being located on the Broadway side Because they were concerned about ubers backing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4457.582s">He</a> said that if he had a hard time getting that variance He would just go with the Medford board because the Medford boards easier to get variances through The general tone of the meeting was that he was doing his best to conform with the Somerville zoning but as we've seen in many of the meetings Medford zoning is very flexible and <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4474.049s">Although</a> it's not supposed to be, because we're under the Massachusetts general law, 40A, section 10, entitled variances, that the reason for variances to be granted are very strict. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4484.182s">And</a> none of them are that the piece of land is too small for me to build the project that I want. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4490.14s">I</a> also felt that when I looked at the paperwork for this project, they seemed to be assuming a use variance. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4496.405s">Rather</a> than asking for a use variance, they're assuming one. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4499.087s">This</a> is a general residence commercial one area. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4502.349s">In</a> a commercial one area, you are allowed to build residences, but this is a mixed use building, which means that they're combining residences and commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4511.736s">So</a> that's a mixed use, which is a special permit that I didn't feel that they were applying for. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4515.898s">When</a> I asked that, they said, no, no, it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4519.083s">But</a> when you look at the project you can clearly see that this is not two separate buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4524.105s">It's</a> one building So I'm concerned about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4526.886s">I</a> was also concerned that when the meeting start after our elected officials spoke The chairman asked if there were any residents who wanted to speak in opposition to the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4536.289s">He</a> said let the record reflect that ten <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4538.87s">residents</a> would like to speak in opposition of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4541.832s">At</a> no point did he ask if anyone wanted to speak in favor of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4545.714s">Perhaps</a> there were another 10 or 20 that wanted to speak in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4548.276s">They</a> also were not given the opportunity to speak in this open and public meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4556.081s">The</a> meeting was not recorded. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4557.842s">Apparently</a> the recording device is not working. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4562.312s">They</a> did say that we could speak if we didn't speak on zoning, parking, density, height, use, traffic, infrastructure, among other items, which precluded any resident from speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4572.641s">I'm</a> not even sure we could comment on the color of the building because everything on that list we were not allowed to speak on. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4580.228s">There</a> was a certain level of complaint from all of us that we were not able to attend the Somerville meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4585.472s">People</a> were not notified of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4587.313s">We</a> kept being told to come back last September, which is an impossibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4591.396s">That</a> meeting was missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4592.357s">The</a> reason that the hearing was held over was so that the residents could get more information. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4598.822s">And</a> I thank the Somerville Aldermen for proposing that because our own Councilors were unavailable to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4604.926s">But</a> then we were not given the opportunity to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4610.898s">One</a> of the other alarming things that happened was one of the Zoning Board members addressed the City Councilors in attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4616.382s">I</a> know that you touched on this a little bit earlier, but she said that the reason they were granting this number of variances is because our City Council hasn't updated the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4624.947s">While</a> it's true that you haven't updated the zoning, it is not in the purview of the Zoning Board of Appeals to change the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4632.011s">They</a> are only allowed to grant variances under the strict rules of Chapter 48, Section 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4637.625s">I</a> think that they should all be made to review that ordinance, that law, it's a state law, and figure out what they're supposed to be doing because they're not doing this properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4650.134s">I</a> think the only remedy that's going to work is for this hearing to be heard again. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4654.838s">We</a> should be able to have the <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4656.97s">The</a> project presented to us because we did not get the full presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4660.852s">People</a> should be able to speak in favor, and people should be able to speak in opposition. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4665.794s">Because</a> while the project may be great, we have no idea because we weren't given the opportunity to hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4672.217s">We</a> weren't given the opportunity to speak in opposition or in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4675.879s">So</a> I just wanted to say that zoning is our most important thing, and we need to protect our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4681.381s">And</a> I think that you should definitely use the reverse 911 system for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4684.563s">If</a> I can get a call, <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4685.823s">for</a> the drug take-back, if I can get a call for the Harvester Energy Festival. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4689.987s">There's</a> no reason that I can't get a call once a month that says there's a project on here that's 55 units. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4696.052s">If</a> you're interested, please come to this meeting on such and such a date and time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4700.315s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6042.345s">Hi</a> real quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6046.006s">Cheryl</a> Rodriguez, 21 par street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6047.886s">I</a> just wanted to mention that the hearing has been closed and the next meeting is for deliberation. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6052.867s">So</a> if there are any questions or neighborhood outreach going to happen, then something has to change at the zoning board of appeals or they're going to make the decision between November 6th and November 10th. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6062.75s">They</a> have not set. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6063.998s">the</a> date of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6064.758s">There</a> are also two complaints about open meeting law violations that have been filed about this project, about that meeting, not the particular project, just the meeting.

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4669.231s">Hi,</a> my name is Cheryl Rodriguez, and I'm running for a seat on the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4673.434s">Thanks</a> to the Democratic Committee of Ward 6 for hosting us. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4677.017s">When</a> I received the email listing the nearly 30 City Council topics, my first reaction was, wow, that's a lot of stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4684.823s">I</a> think that's what intrigued me about running for City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4688.005s">It's</a> a pretty unique opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4689.807s">You</a> get to wear lots of hats, but it all boils down to quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4694.27s">I'm</a> a graduate of Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4695.852s">I</a> have a daughter who graduated in 2014, and a nine-year-old in the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4700.656s">My</a> parents also live in Medford, and my husband Alexis Rodriguez is a candidate for school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4705.721s">I'm</a> a mom in the community who is heavily involved in the Roberts School PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4710.245s">I'm</a> proud to say that I have committed to creating enrichment nights, running fundraisers, and applying for grants to help our children create memories at school. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4718.79s">I'm</a> grateful to the teachers and principal for trusting me and working tirelessly on these inclusive events. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4724.838s">And</a> thanks to all the parents who've helped in ways you never thought you would, like lugging a U-Haul's truck worth of yard sale items out of my house, or punching holes in nearly 600 pieces of artwork for our art show. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4736.718s">I</a> love Medford because there are so many great volunteer and service-oriented groups in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4741.921s">I</a> would really like to find a way to link them all. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4744.863s">Often</a> I hear, I wish we had a group that was working on X, and oftentimes we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4749.666s">I've</a> met many amazing groups of people working to make the lives of people in our community better, and I've tried to help whenever I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4757.03s">Many</a> of the events that we enjoy throughout the city are run by volunteers. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4762.908s">My</a> commitment to the city made me want to run for city council to try to help in a different way. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4768.011s">I've</a> attended meetings, met with elected officials for years to try and get assistance on various issues and needs around the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4774.774s">I've</a> stood with Locust Street of Butters to stop overdevelopment. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4778.176s">I've</a> collected signatures outside Stop and Shop for charter review. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4781.678s">I've</a> advocated for airplane noise relief, fought for small class sizes, and to this day, I still continue to go to zoning board meetings and stand with residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4792.777s">I</a> want to be that person that you feel comfortable reaching out to, the one who will not only listen to your issue, but will dig in to find the best solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4800.828s">I</a> would also like to help push for a portion of our budget to be set aside for future maintenance projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4806.577s">We</a> all know that roofs don't last forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4808.598s">It</a> doesn't have to be a scramble every time one springs a leak. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4811.9s">This</a> will speed things up and help manage expectations. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4815.582s">Money</a> set aside each year in the budget for streets and roads will allow us to fix more in our limited construction season. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4821.585s">This</a> is just one part of our needed city plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4824.407s">We</a> hear that Medford is hot. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4825.728s">We</a> need to take control so that the projects being built here enhance our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4829.91s">Medford</a> needs to be a place where people work, eat, play, and live. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4833.812s">A</a> proper plan will keep us from turning into a bedroom community that creates no places for the people who live here to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4840.237s">I</a> see Mystic Ave as our blank space, our next big opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4844.499s">I</a> know a project with 500 apartments and a tiny amount of commercial is proposed for the center lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4849.483s">I</a> think placing it there would be a mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4851.624s">We</a> need to think bigger. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4853.125s">We</a> need to stop the small-town thinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4855.447s">Projects</a> should not be approved because it is better than what is there now. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4859.049s">Yes,</a> most anything is better than nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4861.251s">But</a> remember, Medford's hot. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4862.992s">Cities</a> that are hot don't just take what is offered. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4865.753s">We</a> ask for what we want and what we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4868.453s">That</a> is how you move the city forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4870.494s">That's</a> how Medford will come alive. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4873.095s">Mystic</a> Ave could be our premier commercial area. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4875.475s">It</a> could hold lab space, office space, an entertainment complex, a beer garden, a doggie daycare, restaurants, a hotel. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4882.337s">The</a> sky's the limit. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4883.937s">If</a> there seems to be a need for some residential, it can be placed at an extreme end of the street to not impact our commercial growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4891.299s">Picture</a> a center island with trees on it, bike lanes, beautiful wide sidewalks, a shuttle to the train station, another bringing people to the square to enjoy lunch, dinner, a show at the Chevalier Theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4902.453s">This</a> is the biggest opportunity in Medford to create this shining new district. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4907.739s">All</a> we have to do is ask for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4909.421s">Don't</a> settle. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4910.843s">While</a> we're at it, we should move to our zoning reform. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4914.065s">In</a> addition to stopping overdevelopment and parcelization that is burdening our neighborhoods, our zoning should be updated so that all new construction housing projects that don't meet the threshold to add affordable units pay into our housing affordability fund to be used in conjunction with CPA money to create affordable housing in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4935.037s">This</a> is a minor ask and one that other cities don't hesitate to require. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4939.98s">Medford</a> is growing, but like anything, we need to nurture it and guide it. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4944.142s">In</a> a well-planned city, that growth maintains a balance of commercial and residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4949.506s">We</a> need to leverage enough new commercial to be able to afford needed infrastructure improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4956.049s">I'm</a> excited to dig in and be a part of this pivotal time in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=4958.971s">I'm</a> a first-time candidate, long-time advocate for Medford. <a

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cCMLP2REW0g&t=1937.969s">Hi,</a> I'm Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/cCMLP2REW0g&t=1939.049s">I</a> live at 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/cCMLP2REW0g&t=1942.232s">I'm</a> glad that we're talking about zoning, and I hope that we move past talking, but when we look for someone to bring in, we need to make sure that that group is independent and non-biased. <a href="https://youtu.be/cCMLP2REW0g&t=1951.558s">We</a> need to make sure that the zoning reforms that we make are Medford-centric and benefit Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/cCMLP2REW0g&t=1957.142s">Everyone</a> talked about all the development that's happening in the city, but what I heard was residential, residential, residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/cCMLP2REW0g&t=1963.226s">What's</a> different between our development and Somerville and Cambridge's development is that they are very conscious of maintaining a balance of commercial and residential and making sure that they're able to support the infrastructure, the increased needs, the quality of life items that residents require and should have. <a href="https://youtu.be/cCMLP2REW0g&t=1982.319s">So</a> I think that's really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/cCMLP2REW0g&t=1984.14s">We</a> need to think about that as we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/cCMLP2REW0g&t=1987.002s">I</a> haven't spoke to one single resident that said, I really hope they sell the house next door to me and put up an apartment building. <a href="https://youtu.be/cCMLP2REW0g&t=1992.966s">But</a> we have people living in homes right now that are in apartment zones that that very thing could happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/cCMLP2REW0g&t=1999.171s">And</a> if you've ever seen a resident who's heard that there's going to be a 12-unit building shading their home, it's very traumatizing. <a href="https://youtu.be/cCMLP2REW0g&t=2006.656s">And</a> there's nothing that we can do because of the way that the zoning is written. <a href="https://youtu.be/cCMLP2REW0g&t=2010.259s">Right</a> now, what's happening as we're waiting, this is already happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/cCMLP2REW0g&t=2015.155s">developers</a> are coming, they're proposing what they want to do, they're going to the ZBA, they're getting multiple, multiple variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/cCMLP2REW0g&t=2021.598s">And</a> we see that when you have variances in commercial areas where you add residential, that it can cause problems adding commercial in later. <a href="https://youtu.be/cCMLP2REW0g&t=2028.461s">We</a> had a Dog for Days group that couldn't come in because they were abutting an apartment building. <a href="https://youtu.be/cCMLP2REW0g&t=2034.604s">We</a> had a meeting about the Wegmans and there were resident concerns about loading dock hours because the residents were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/cCMLP2REW0g&t=2041.871s">So</a> I'm very cautious about what happens with Mystic Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/cCMLP2REW0g&t=2045.414s">Of</a> course, the first proposal that came out was 500 units. <a href="https://youtu.be/cCMLP2REW0g&t=2049.478s">of</a> apartments on Mystic Avenue, dead center of nine parcels, which will impact our ability to develop commercially. <a href="https://youtu.be/cCMLP2REW0g&t=2056.901s">And</a> we need to stop being the city where developers believe that they can come in and make their own zoning because we haven't updated the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/cCMLP2REW0g&t=2065.746s">So</a> they're just going to change it and do what they want, and we're going to be left running behind.<h2><a href="../2017-09-20_CtRL2YQa7iI/2017-09-20_CtRL2YQa7iI.html">Medford, MA City Council - Sep. 19, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10663.67s">It's</a> all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10664.912s">It's</a> all right.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10668.255s">I</a> went to Georgetown. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10669.316s">Oh,</a> nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10669.877s">But</a> I'm from the area, so.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12678.076s">I</a> don't want to fall down the stairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12682.197s">Just</a> really quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12682.997s">Sharma</a> Rodriguez, 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12685.118s">A</a> couple of important takeaways from that meeting for me were that we need to keep filing the complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12689.919s">The</a> volume of complaints are what our elected officials, our representatives, our senators use to show that our community is impacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12697.861s">So</a> while it's great to write letters to our federal delegation, and I encourage you to write to Elizabeth Warren. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12702.804s">She</a> is our representative on the Quiet Skies Caucus. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12705.766s">So</a> that's in the federal level for making the skies quieter and more livable for all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12711.269s">We</a> need to keep filing the complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12712.73s">Those</a> are the numbers that they refer to. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12714.851s">If</a> the complaints go down, that's how Milton got action was that their complaints were up, unique complaints, multiple complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12721.935s">And</a> that's what they're going to use for leverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12723.856s">So</a> we need to keep filing those complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12725.517s">So</a> I hope that reverse 9-1-1, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12727.415s">will</a> get us some unique complaints.

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=2603.19s">Hi,</a> I'm Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=2604.432s">I</a> live at 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=2606.314s">I'm</a> very close to the Roberts Elementary School, which is also a heavy flyover area. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=2611.401s">We</a> get a lot of loud traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=2613.197s">And</a> I want to echo Councilor Falco that we definitely need to keep up the complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=2617.959s">They</a> do factor those in. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=2619.479s">And</a> because we were absent for so long, other towns mitigation is our increased suffering. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=2625.902s">The</a> runway is actually not slated to be completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=2628.683s">completely</a> finished until November. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=2630.525s">They</a> expect it to open partially. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=2633.288s">That's</a> what I read on their website as well as when I spoke to someone on the phone there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=2639.655s">So</a> this noise isn't going to go away when the runway opens anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=2643.979s">The</a> altitude is not going to increase when the runway opens. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=2647.423s">I'm</a> clocking planes between <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=2650.496s">1,000</a> and 1,500 feet coming over my house as late as 3 in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=2656.338s">It's</a> very loud. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=2657.158s">My</a> house is shaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=2658.098s">Don't</a> put anything on the edge of a shelf or you're going to find it on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=2662.22s">So</a> this is a very serious issue for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=2664.78s">And</a> I hope that we know exactly where the loudest parts are and the noise monitors are placed there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=2670.342s">Because</a> if they do give mitigation to the city, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=2673.623s">They'll</a> do it on a very narrow corridor. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=2675.725s">They'll</a> do it on very specific streets and addresses. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=2679.087s">So</a> if a neighborhood that is greatly impacted doesn't have a noise monitor, they may lose out on mitigation if there's not a monitor close enough to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=2687.893s">So</a> that's a really important factor for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=2690.155s">I</a> did price out triple pane windows, which will reduce the noise, and they will run $8,000 to $16,000, and that's just to add a third pane. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=2698.407s">to</a> your existing windows because I did have all of my windows double pane replaced three years ago and I'm told that that is not enough by Massport to reduce the sound and that we would also have to get special soundproofing caulking so it could run up to $40,000 to make your house <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=2716.283s">75%</a> quieter, and running noise machines all night. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=2721.749s">My</a> daughter's neurologist, my nine-year-old daughter, has said it's not good for your brain to not have time to rest at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=2728.777s">So</a> this is a serious issue that I hope will be <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=2732.69s">greatly</a> considered and we can get some action. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=2735.652s">I</a> did meet Pat Jalen on Salem Street a couple of weeks ago and we stood and watched the planes flying across Salem Street for about 10 minutes and it was insane. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=2746.638s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2017-06-07_DXZ3Y2L8Tik/2017-06-07_DXZ3Y2L8Tik.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 6, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3035.006s">Hi,</a> I'm Cheryl Rodriguez from 281 Park Street, and I'm just here to promote the Medford Citywide Yard Sale. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3041.689s">This</a> is a great eco-friendly fundraiser that will have no negative effects on the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3046.992s">I</a> got the idea from running the Roberts Elementary Yard Sale. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3050.353s">We've</a> run four of them, and each time we've raised $1,000 for enrichment in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3054.915s">So</a> I thought that citywide would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3057.477s">We</a> pay for trash, so why throw things out that are still good that others can use? <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3061.999s">So</a> the plan is on June 10th, <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3064.76s">People</a> will register ahead of time for $25, and your address will appear on a citywide map. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3070.205s">If</a> you don't have a yard, then you can sell at the Condon Shell. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3072.967s">So</a> we'll have tables set up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3074.168s">We</a> have the shell reserved. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3076.09s">And</a> people will shop around to all the different yard sales. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3079.593s">And</a> it'll be great, because the money will go towards the Friends of Felsmere Heights. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3085.037s">Anyone</a> that doesn't know what the Friends of Felsmere Heights is, <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3089.31s">They</a> approached me after they found me involved with the 61 Locust Street development and the working to right-size the Breakpro project. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3096.972s">So</a> we share a common goal of stopping overdevelopment that they think will be detrimental to the quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3102.833s">They</a> want to work with Medford and Malden officials to purchase the Malden Hospital property and return the majority of the land to Parkland with an appropriate size development. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3111.895s">The</a> purchase would be made with a combination of CPA funds, grants, as well as donations and fundraisers such as this. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3119.497s">So</a> this project, if that project went through, it would have a seriously negative effect on the Fulton Heights area. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3126.041s">So</a> it's very relevant to Medford residents to try to move this project forward and stop that area from being overdeveloped. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3133.827s">Because</a> several hundred more cars coming down Fulton Spring and Fulton Street would be very detrimental to the quality of life of Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3142.405s">So</a> this group has also generously agreed to split their proceeds with the abutters for the 61 Locust Street or Old Shaw's project. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3150.572s">As</a> residents and myself, I feel it's important to come out and support them in their fight for their neighborhood as well as the rest of our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3158.779s">Because</a> once there's overdevelopment, overcrowding in our schools, it's going to be too late to turn that back. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3163.923s">So</a> we have to be proactive and work hard for that now. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3166.945s">So</a> I hope that many of you will join me in registering for this yard sale on June 10th to support our neighborhoods and protect them from overdevelopment. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3175.988s">We</a> have a Facebook page, the Medford Citywide Yard Sale Facebook page. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3179.609s">We</a> also have an email address, MedfordCityYardSale at gmail.com. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3184.631s">So</a> the yard sale will be on June 10th from 9 to 2 and I hope to see many of you there.

complaints was to concentrate the traffic on what they call the Airline Highway. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6212.291s">So</a> basically, if you affect less people, you'll get less complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6217.072s">I've</a> received several letters in response to my complaints that say, we've concentrated the traffic over your area so that it will

as loud as that one plane. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6261.837s">The</a> neighbor with the one extremely loud plane may qualify for soundproofing, while my neighborhood may not, because they're not doing it cumulatively. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6272.251s">So</a> that's an issue because the past two days I think we had over 100 planes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6277.935s">We</a> had more than 100,000 planes fly over us last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6281.097s">Our</a> planes fly in at less than 5,000 feet off the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6285.86s">Now</a> Milton, who got extensive help from state representatives <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6291.287s">Their</a> planes fly in at approximately 10,000 square feet, more than double what they're flying over in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6298.389s">And</a> they have had several feature articles in the Globe about how their neighborhoods are suffering. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6304.091s">And</a> if anyone saw the two-sentence article that we had in the Globe yesterday, it said, residents get a chance to squawk about airline noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6314.315s">That</a> was the headline. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6315.555s">The</a> next two lines were, apparently it's loud in Medford, according to city officials anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6321.989s">come</a> to City Hall at 7 o'clock to hear the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6325.914s">So</a> that's the level of respect that we're getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6328.778s">And</a> also, Elizabeth Warren is our senator, and she is on a committee that studies the FAA noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6335.868s">So</a> I encourage people to escalate. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6338.625s">and</a> go to your state reps, go to your national senator, get some action, because this is getting worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6344.686s">But</a> understand that just because it isn't loud in your neighborhood doesn't mean that it isn't loud. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6349.387s">They've</a> intentionally concentrated the noise to reduce the complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6353.908s">People's</a> homes have shaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6356.029s">I</a> have things that fall off shelves. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6357.549s">I</a> have soot on the back of my home. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6359.37s">This</a> is not from traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6361.561s">planes</a> flying over my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6363.382s">My</a> daughter is under treatment in neurology. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6365.703s">She's</a> nine years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6366.784s">She's</a> had severe migraines for three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6369.465s">She</a> misses more than 20 days of school a year from migraines. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6372.687s">She's</a> being followed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6373.547s">She's</a> had medication doubled. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6374.888s">She's</a> had medication changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6377.429s">It's</a> all connected to sleep interruption from the planes that fly over late at night, that start at 5 in the morning, that don't end until midnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6385.713s">Once</a> in a while, we get a 3 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6387.074s">flyover.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6388.014s">This</a> is an issue for people. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6390.218s">We</a> need to find some way to get soundproofing or just get them to fly higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6394.22s">I</a> do not believe that the answer is to disperse the traffic and affect more people. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6399.963s">I</a> think that the airlines need to consider that there are people under them and that they're affecting us negatively and keep calling and complaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6408.488s">But</a> don't stop at just complain to Massport because Massport already knows it's an issue because this is an issue that was intentionally concentrated over specific people. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=6417.553s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4983.762s">Well,</a> September, that's a big difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4986.142s">That</a> 30 days, I mean, keep waiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4988.403s">What</a> are we on, seven months now? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4991.023s">I</a> feel like this is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4992.564s">Every</a> time I go down to the building office and I look through those books, I see demo, demo permit, demo permit, demo permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5000.365s">This</a> needs to be done now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5002.425s">We</a> don't have time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5003.226s">If</a> you wait six more months to put this in committee, I'm not sure how long that moratorium has been in the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5008.907s">I</a> waited, was at a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5011.307s">for</a> your subcommittee and you're waiting for an opinion on that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5014.049s">These</a> things are happening and they're happening now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5016.97s">And</a> once these houses are knocked down, they're gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5019.311s">You</a> can't rebuild. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5020.372s">You</a> can't, oh, well, let's rebuild that 1890 house. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5022.733s">We</a> never should have knocked it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5024.174s">It's</a> gonna be too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5025.495s">So</a> we need to move faster because we don't need any more prefab condos that are going up that cost more than a single family house. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5032.278s">And</a> single family houses, people are desperate to get those in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5035.64s">So</a> I don't know why we wanna knock them down. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5038.781s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7535.97s">Hi,</a> I'm Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7537.131s">I</a> live at 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7538.592s">My</a> street is designated as a main artery. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7541.595s">So</a> I think we have the street cleaning is supposed to commence in April and begin end on October 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7549.922s">I</a> hope that part of the discussion will include the main arteries, because what we really need on those arteries is enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7556.408s">I,</a> like Councilor Dela Rousseau, get the <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7559.838s">1</a> to 2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7560.579s">wake-up</a> call, now twice a week for the street cleaners coming in the middle of the night. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7564.622s">But</a> I often look out the window and note that even though one night is odd and one night is even, the street cleaner has to go around a car. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7571.488s">So</a> if there's no enforcement, then those roads aren't actually getting cleaned, and my husband will go out the next day with the shovel and pick up the debris on the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7579.534s">broken</a> glass and such, that hasn't been picked up by the street cleaner because someone is parked in front of our house. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7584.976s">So</a> that's important as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7586.876s">Also,</a> when you do the clean sweep in the fall, because street cleaning on the main arteries has ended, we don't get street cleaning after October 30th, so all the leaves are in the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7597.88s">And</a> the neighbors will go out and take care of those as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7600.642s">So</a> if we're not going to have enforcement, then increased street cleaning is not going to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7604.305s">I</a> know that the police are taxed, but that should be something that is included in the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7609.049s">Because</a> even though we have the signs on our street every 10 to 20 feet, there's a sign that says, move on Wednesday night, move on Thursday night, the cars are not moving and nothing's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7618.457s">The</a> street cleaners are just going around them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7620.539s">So</a> that's not really useful for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7623.401s">I</a> do hope that it will do more street cleaning. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7625.263s">My</a> father lives on Garfield Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7627.045s">and</a> he's frequently cleaning out the catch basins because they don't get the regular cleaning. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7631.047s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2017-04-04_43IdaIBcFp0/2017-04-04_43IdaIBcFp0.html">Medford, MA City Council - Apr. 4, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7742.625s">Hi,</a> I'm Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7743.666s">I</a> live at 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7745.889s">And</a> I'm pretty happy to see that this is coming up, because I've spoken here countless times about that we need to follow zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7754.4s">But</a> the second part of that is that we also need to look at the zoning that we currently have and see if that zoning is working for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7761.112s">I</a> pulled out a zoning map of Medford today and I looked around my neighborhood and I saw that all of Salem Street and pretty much every street from Fulton Street to 93 was zoned apartment 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7773.138s">And</a> as I drove here and took 10 minutes to drive from Park Street to City Hall, which is pretty crazy because it's four blocks, all the traffic, I thought, can we really handle that many apartment buildings? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7785.385s">on</a> Salem Street in that area with traffic, with the school that's the largest elementary school in the city, and overcrowded? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7794.211s">No,</a> we can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7794.952s">So</a> we really need to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7796.653s">I</a> know that there is calls for hiring consultants, but that can take a lot of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7801.216s">Anyone</a> who attended the zoning meeting on the Salem Street project said, well, you know, one apartment building isn't going to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7807.24s">But</a> they did have a stack of support letters from people that owned property on Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7813.845s">that</a> would probably be the next buildings that come up and want to add apartment buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7818.086s">So</a> that could be six more buildings in the next year or two, 10 more buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7822.008s">Then</a> we'd swing around down Fountain Street and add another 10 or 15 or 20 buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7826.209s">And</a> we would cripple that entire side of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7828.69s">We</a> would change the dynamic. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7831.271s">My</a> parents have lived in that neighborhood for more than 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7834.172s">It's</a> a heavy owner-occupied neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7836.553s">I</a> live on another side that's also heavily owner-occupied. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7840.774s">More</a> than 80% of Medford is owner-occupied. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7843.904s">Shifting</a> to more buildings where people are not coming out and talking to their neighbors is really not what Medford is about. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7851.133s">And</a> we really need to be cognizant of whether our quality of life is more important than just adding more buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7857.7s">Because</a> when you add more buildings, they don't just drop tax money off at the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7861.565s">They</a> come with infrastructure needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7863.167s">They</a> come with costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7864.735s">And</a> do those costs exceed the tax money that we get? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7868.418s">Because</a> I know it looks great when it said, look, we got this much more tax money this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7872.241s">But</a> we really have to factor in our infrastructure costs as we see that we're short police and we're short fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7878.686s">And</a> I don't believe that these additional tax revenues that we're getting from the Lumiere's or the, I don't even want to say, but the Locust Street that hopefully will never happen, will not exceed the costs that they will add to our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7891.916s">They'll</a> diminish our quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7894.3s">And</a> we really need to think about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7896.201s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8694.949s">No,</a> that's totally fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8695.989s">I</a> can do it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8697.37s">I'm</a> Cheryl Rodriguez at 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8701.392s">And</a> yes, I tried not to say exactly what I was going to say for the petition when I came up earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8706.034s">But</a> before I begin, a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8708.675s">I</a> noticed that Councilor Falco wants to slow down and wait for a consultant. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8718.658s">Or</a> no, actually, Councilor Scarpelli slowed slow down. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8721.203s">You</a> said to get a consultant. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8724.129s">And</a> Councilor Scarpelli said to slow down and get the mayor's opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8727.916s">Unfortunately,</a> that doesn't help me. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8730.669s">I</a> wrote it down, it's an exact quote.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8745.854s">You</a> didn't say to get the administration's opinion? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8747.995s">Can</a> we roll the tape back? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8748.815s">Absolutely</a> not. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8749.255s">Because</a> I wrote it down.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8769.249s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8770.05s">So</a> either way, either of those courses is not going to help those of us living in the Salem Street area, because we are currently under siege. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8779.775s">The</a> first apartment building is on the block, and the line behind them is stretching all the way from Haines Square to 93, and it's taking a turn down Fountain Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8790.4s">I</a> can't wait a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8791.722s">I</a> can't wait six months for a consultant to come in and go, wow, are you crazy? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8795.065s">You</a> can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8796.086s">Because</a> there's already going to be six, 10 buildings already approved and ready to go, because it's apartment zoned. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8802.412s">And</a> all they have to do is say, we'll do three stories, and they're good to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8805.636s">Because</a> that's what the zoning says. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8807.217s">This</a> is an emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8808.759s">This</a> needs to happen now. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8810.34s">The</a> Roberts Elementary School currently has 569 children. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8813.701s">And</a> just to put that into perspective, more than 100 of those students are ELL students that require extra services. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8819.804s">So</a> while the schools are built to hold 600 students, they are not built to hold 600 students where 100 of them need extra services in this and 50 of them need extra services in that, because those are extra spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8831.568s">So</a> this is extremely important to me as I have a third grader in that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8836.99s">and</a> the largest third grade in the entire city at five classes and more than 100 students, just in the third grade, not including the ELL, not including the inclusion classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8846.695s">So</a> this is very important to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8849.416s">This</a> is very personal. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8852.386s">but</a> just to get back. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8854.207s">So</a> I think that we really need to consider this before we think about waiting for a consultant. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8858.389s">This</a> is one of the most important things that the city council's in charge of is zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8862.191s">And</a> when zoning is going well, zoning is virtually invisible. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8864.912s">For</a> years, the zoning in Medford was virtually invisible. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8868.174s">A</a> lot of people went in and they got their decks and they added their extra parking spaces, but all of a sudden, some developers noticed a hole and they came in and they're trying to fill us in. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8878.459s">And</a> so now we're paying attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8883.35s">So</a> we need to look realistically at what these neighborhoods can handle. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8886.991s">When</a> we saw the traffic loads at the meeting that I attended for Salem Street, they recorded more than 1,000 cars per hour going down Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8894.854s">Think</a> about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8895.494s">That's</a> a lot of cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8897.955s">A</a> lot of times that traffic is backed up. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8900.415s">I</a> tried to get to Haines Square over the weekend and the traffic was backed up almost to the Rotary at 93 on just a random Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8909.463s">The</a> zoning there calls for apartment buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8911.444s">Those</a> apartment buildings can be three stories high and probably between 12 to 15 units. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8917.549s">Imagine</a> them on every plot on Salem Street and the street would just be closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8922.672s">The</a> neighborhood would be decimated. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8925.114s">That</a> is what the zoning intends for that area as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8928.916s">And</a> that may have been true when they created that zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8932.659s">It's</a> no longer true. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8934.36s">It's</a> emergent that this council act to change that zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8939.133s">to</a> a more appropriate scenario. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8942.135s">What</a> that scenario is, I can't say, but I can say that it's not apartments up and down Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8947.94s">We</a> also need to consider the load of those additional residents on our infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8953.344s">Our</a> police and our fire are understaffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8956.246s">Our</a> DPW is understaffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8961.934s">So</a> we really need to consider the quality of life also of people that are living in those areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8966.497s">What</a> are their expectations when they moved in? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8968.819s">Because</a> if you look at Salem Street, most of those buildings are one story. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8973.302s">There</a> are some two family houses mixed in. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8976.624s">There's</a> a couple of apartment buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8979.206s">More</a> of them are closer to 93. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8981.467s">These</a> are not areas that we think of as high concentrated residences. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8988.658s">basically</a> trying to overcrowd this side of the city if we now target this street to suddenly enact the apartment one zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8996.084s">We</a> need to consider, when we keep the zoning, if our infrastructure needs can meet the expanding population that this zoning allows. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9006.492s">I</a> would say no. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9008.533s">We</a> can't support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9010.234s">We're</a> not gonna suddenly be able to add one, five, 10% to our population and <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9018.645s">be</a> able to have enough police and fire to support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9020.746s">We</a> know that it takes several months to train police and fire, but it also takes tax dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9027.189s">While</a> we heard that these new buildings will bring 100,000, or I think Locust Street said they were going to bring a million dollars in new tax revenue, 490 families would bring in an incredible amount of additional needs on the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9043.328s">even</a> if they just had a small 10% children, that's almost 50 children added to the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9049.271s">Can</a> our school system handle that burden? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9051.271s">Can</a> our budget handle the additional costs of those students? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9055.433s">So</a> I urge you to immediately look at all the streets that are zoned apartment one. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9059.815s">Salem</a> Street's not the only street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9061.396s">Fountain</a> Street's not the only street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9063.297s">I'm</a> sure there are pockets in other parts of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9066.318s">My</a> map is pretty hard to read out the street names, so I could only pick out the ones that I recognize. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9073.755s">This</a> is coming and this isn't just something that is going to maybe happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9078.859s">This</a> is something that is actively happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9081.841s">People</a> are watching to see if this project at the old break pro is going to be approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9087.065s">And</a> while it's great to see something different there as opposed to an abandoned building, we have to consider if the street can handle the load of buildings up and down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9097.652s">So</a> I hope that <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9100.478s">you</a> will take this seriously and responsibly try to change this zoning as quickly as possible before it's too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9108.4s">Because</a> once those buildings are constructed and sitting on those sites, once those children are going up to the high school to enroll in our schools, it's too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9118.303s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5777.311s">I'll</a> yield.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5781.993s">Cheryl</a> Rodriguez, 281 Park Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5785.115s">So</a> I've heard a lot of people talking about the combined facility would be $38 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5790.677s">We</a> heard at the debates that they got $10 million in Malden for their police station, and that this administration didn't apply for any because of time restrictions. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5800.162s">But</a> if they had gotten $10 million for the facility, that would have brought our costs down to $28 million, which would be only $6 million more than they were talking about for just building a police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5811.292s">when</a> we still have a fire station that will be looming over our heads waiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5815.395s">Do</a> we have any assurances that there'll be time to file for grants for the fire station or are we just going to pay full price for that one too? <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5822.821s">Because</a> I heard that they're very concerned about us as taxpayers having to shoulder these bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5828.725s">I</a> haven't heard of any grant applications going out to help us to offset these bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5833.709s">I've</a> seen grants for libraries. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5835.009s">I've</a> seen grants for renovating sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5837.191s">Yes,</a> we're renovating sidewalks at a cost to the taxpayer of a quarter of a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5842.114s">So</a> I would encourage, strongly encourage, and I hope that other people do encourage <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5847.518s">the</a> administration to go after these grants because we just left $10 million on the table for the police station at a minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5853.821s">Perhaps</a> there were more grants if we combined a police and fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5856.982s">And</a> we could be having a ribbon cutting or a shoveling for a combined police and fire station.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5867.745s">When</a> we had the debates, there was a Malden city councilor who was overseeing it at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5873.547s">That</a> was in Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5874.488s">And</a> he said that in Malden, they got $9.8 million for their police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5878.589s">So</a> we know that the mayor is aware of these grants because she was present at the stage <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5883.728s">and</a> clapped vigorously at the grants that he received. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5887.029s">And</a> I would have assumed that a phone call to the mayor would have yielded details. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5892.151s">I'm</a> not the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5893.311s">Had</a> I made the phone call, it wouldn't have had any effect on this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5896.692s">I'm</a> more than happy to make the phone call and call the mayor's office and let her know what the grants are. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5902.634s">But</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5904.198s">What</a> we need to do now is since we're clearly going to go forward on just a police station, before the fire tower is knocked down, a new location should be picked for that fire tower. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5914.3s">Money</a> should be allocated for that fire tower. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5916.881s">The</a> firefighters should be confident that in conjunction with their tower being torn down, a new one will be placed. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5923.782s">They</a> shouldn't wait until 2023 or 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5928.126s">or</a> 2022 or whenever to get their tower. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5930.227s">They</a> should get their tower immediately because as we're told, our insurance rates will go up if they don't have a tower because they'll not be able to do training here. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5938.029s">And</a> we also need to figure out where they're going to store their equipment because the very idea of the police, the fire chief thinking that he has to auction off equipment because he has nowhere to store it is chilling and upsetting to me as a taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5950.792s">And</a> I, <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5952.106s">I</a> saw the reaction on some of the councilors' faces, and it was upsetting to them as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5955.567s">And</a> that's something that would have been addressed had these meetings not taken place behind closed doors with a handful of people who all nodded in unison because they agreed with what was happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5966.592s">We</a> need diverse voices at the table so that multiple layered conversations can take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5972.114s">And</a> these things don't come upon us at the last minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5975.196s">So</a> I encourage the administration to invite people to the table <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5978.657s">who</a> will give her different ideas, and not just ideas that agree with hers. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5982.699s">That's</a> very important to any administration, and I encourage a future administration in Medford to do the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5989.382s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2017-02-17_uOl8IpBqQPs/2017-02-17_uOl8IpBqQPs.html">Medford, MA City Council - Feb. 14, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5650.985s">Hi,</a> Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5652.006s">I</a> live at 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5654.287s">I'm</a> glad that we're finally talking about perhaps moving the Board of Appeals meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5657.949s">Because</a> this council has such a heavy burden of maintaining our zoning ordinances, it's really important that you're able to attend these meetings at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5666.354s">So</a> a Wednesday meeting, or perhaps let the board choose a day that works for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5671.497s">The</a> next meeting that will have a large crowd will be the Salem Street Development meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5676.579s">That</a> is already being held on a Wednesday, on March 8. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5679.693s">Perhaps</a> it would be a wonderful time to test out this room, because anyone who's attended any of these ZBA meetings knows that a developer presentation runs in excess of an hour, where they show you pictures of everything from shrubs to fitness equipment to present their entire project from the ground up. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5698.651s">And</a> that room is very small. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5701.153s">Saying</a> that 20 people fit in it is <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5703.706s">is</a> an exaggeration. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5704.666s">It</a> really doesn't fit that many people. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5706.567s">So</a> I'd like to see, since this is probably one of the most important boards in the city as far as shaping the city, these meetings be brought out into the public, be televised, or at least be in a room that's large enough for all of us to know, and perhaps if we can get those agendas online so that people know that these meetings are coming up, because this is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5726.852s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2017-10-05_u7r73CCT980/2017-10-05_u7r73CCT980.html">Medford, MA City Council - Jan. 31, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2096.634s">Hi,</a> my name is Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2098.276s">I</a> live at 281 Park Street, so I'm fairly close to the project that we're discussing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2104.086s">I'm</a> going to, pardon me as I'm going to read, but I think that the city council has a lot more control over zoning today than they actually believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2111.412s">According</a> to the Massachusetts law, chapter 40, section 10 on titled ordinances, the permit granting authority, which in our case is the ZBA has the power to have a hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2121.26s">And</a> I'll skip through a little bit after they notify all in to right. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2129.975s">such</a> permaculture owing to circumstances, so they're only supposed to give us circumstances, variances for circumstances relating to soil conditions, shape, or topography of such land or structures. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2142.457s">and</a> especially affecting such land or structures, but not affecting generally the zoning district in which is located. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2148.442s">A</a> literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance or bylaw would involve substantial hardship, financial or otherwise, to the petitioner or appellate, and that desirable relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good, and without nullifying or substantially derogating from the intent or purpose of the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2168.799s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2170.3s">Right</a> now, that's not how our variances are being granted. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2173.182s">As</a> you can see, this parcel is fairly rectangular in shape, so the topography is okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2179.805s">He's</a> allowed to build three levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2183.047s">There's</a> a reason why we have space around people's houses, because somebody else's house shouldn't be in the shadow of a building. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2191.108s">It</a> has to be not developer-centric. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2192.688s">It</a> has to be people-centric. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2193.969s">So</a> I encourage people to come to these meetings because this is happening now on Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2199.13s">I</a> was at the same meeting where the developer told us he was encouraged by the administration. <a

href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2208.232s">So</a> this isn't just one building. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2209.952s">So</a> imagine if we built 10 to 12 buildings, each with 21 units. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2214.073s">We're</a> talking about an addition of 210 to approximately 250 units on the overcrowded Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2221.395s">The</a> surrounding streets in this area are so overcrowded with cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2225.276s">They're</a> coming in and they're looking for residential parking permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2228.437s">Everett</a> Street has residential parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2229.858s">Parts</a> of Tainter have residential parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2232.119s">Court</a> Street has parking on one side. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2234.259s">Park</a> Street at that location has parking on one side. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2237.26s">There's</a> a school that's the largest in the entire city, elementary school. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2241.561s">It</a> doesn't have room for any more children. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2243.562s">So</a> at some point, we have to start considering that <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2246.923s">These</a> variants being granted are not for the good of the city they're only for the good of the developer. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2251.906s">The</a> developer who will cash his check and walk away and leave us hanging on trying to figure out how we're going to cover the extra infrastructure costs that have suddenly been thrust upon us as these people are welcome if they follow zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2266.413s">But</a> we can't just keep overbuilding and pretending that the infrastructure costs aren't real, that the cost to people's quality of life aren't real, because they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2274.278s">So</a> I hope people will come tomorrow to the community development meeting at 6.30, and most importantly, come to the zoning board meeting next Tuesday at 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2283.763s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=5183.755s">Hi,</a> just one quick point. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=5185.036s">Cheryl</a> Rodriguez, 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=5187.538s">Just</a> talking about lighting, I'm hoping that we're gonna have some softer LED lighting for the neighborhoods, that we're not gonna have the harsh lights of the square in people's residential areas, just something to consider, we don't wanna add noise pollution to the neighborhoods.<h2><a href="../2018-01-22_IxvjbChoNJk/2018-01-22_IxvjbChoNJk.html">Medford, MA School Committee - Jan. 22, 2017 [Livestream] (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1.292s">So</a> today I'm here to ask for support and help for the Roberts PTO's grant application to the Community Preservation Commission for the restoration of our school playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=10.679s">The</a> Roberts Elementary School is one of the most populous elementary schools in Medford and our playground, as are all the elementary school playgrounds, is in need of replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=19.426s">The</a> worst item in all our playgrounds seems to be the surfacing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=22.969s">So</a> I applied for this grant for a few reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=25.751s">One</a> was that I saw the mayor's capital improvement plan at a city council meeting and it included line items to replace one school playground per year, which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=35.056s">And</a> I thought if we coupled it with community preservation money, we could replace two playgrounds per year and everyone could have a new playground in two to three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=44.042s">So</a> that would be about 2,400 students in our elementary schools that would all have a shiny new playground to play in. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=50.615s">So</a> that benefit would radiate out through the neighborhood that each school is in because it will allow their family members of the students to enjoy the playgrounds as well as people that just live in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=61.318s">We've</a> gone through the eligibility phase and we now have to prepare a complete application. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=68.119s">So</a> we don't know exactly how much it's going to cost and we need help from the district in order to <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=74.981s">figure</a> out the parameters of what you'll require, companies that we have to go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=79.404s">This</a> is outside of my scope of expertise as well as my authority as a parent volunteer at the Roberts Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=86.789s">We</a> were able to apply with a supporting letter from the principal at our school. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=91.793s">But</a> in order to go forward, we need approval and help from the school committee and the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=98.238s">So</a> I'm hoping that we're going to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=101.1s">The</a> application needs to be submitted by March 2nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=104.762s">I'm</a> hoping that we'll make it through the first round because that will allow for completion to happen in the summer when the students are not in school so that they won't have any interrupted recess time and they'll be able to start September with a shiny new playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=117.927s">If</a> we do receive community preservation funds, there are other grants that we can apply for to help supplement, but we're not eligible to apply for those grants until we receive funding from the community preservation. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=134.047s">I'm</a> hoping that you guys can help me out. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=135.848s">That's</a> pretty much why I'm here.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3443.536s">Hi,</a> I'm Cheryl Rodriguez again, 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3446.597s">I</a> am an active member of my PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3449.359s">No</a> one personally approached me, but I can tell you that my PTO sends constant flyers. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3455.581s">They</a> have events almost monthly. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3457.822s">Every</a> PTO does this. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3459.243s">We</a> have Facebook pages. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3461.204s">Some</a> of us have Twitter accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3463.585s">We</a> make every effort to have people join. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3466.086s">I'm</a> not a board member on a PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3467.907s">I</a> went to a PTO meeting and I <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3470.708s">raised</a> my hand and volunteered, I've added programming to my PTO on a voluntary basis and people do the best that they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3479.518s">I've</a> gone to meetings where there's been three people and I know for a fact that a flyer's gone out, that a flyer's been on the window at the school, that we've posted it on our Facebook page and there's three people there. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3491.271s">And</a> that's not because we're not engaging our community, because we have signs up at every event that things are going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3497.014s">We</a> send out emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3498.795s">There's</a> only so much that you can do, but you have to be realistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3502.176s">When</a> I had my first child, I worked full time and I did not volunteer at the PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3506.218s">I</a> did not have the time or the bandwidth. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3508.279s">I'm</a> lucky now that I can and I do, and I appreciate that a lot of people are not able to do that, and I don't think that we should be disparaging people on either side. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3517.689s">People</a> that do have the time to volunteer, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3519.832s">People</a> that don't, you know, that's fine too. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3522.535s">We're</a> here for all of the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3524.136s">We</a> do fundraising for every child. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3527.079s">all</a> the schools and we're not singling out and go oh Johnny's mother didn't help so he doesn't get a t-shirt on field day. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3532.761s">So</a> I think we need to remember that and I hope that some of your recommendations will include ways to help some of our PTOs. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3539.383s">Especially</a> those of us that are in high needs districts, high needs areas where our parents do work two jobs or our parents don't speak English. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3548.086s">are</a> they have special needs children they have to attend to or they have three or four children and packing those kids up and coming to a PTO meeting is impossible. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3556.036s">We</a> even tried to do our meetings on Facebook live and it didn't it didn't increase our attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3562.243s">So</a> we're all doing the best that we can and I hope that <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3565.787s">The</a> district is able to help us because from year to year, some PTOs find that it's really hard for them to afford that $8,000 to $10,000 that we need for the buses or that field day event or that in-school enrichment and we do the best that we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3579.513s">Sometimes</a> you run a fundraiser and you think you're going to make $1,000 and you make $500 and you have to add another fundraiser on the fly because you're not going to cover those bills at the end of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3589.578s">Thanks.</a> <h2><a href="../2017-01-13_HLZVJwxP68w/2017-01-13_HLZVJwxP68w.html">Medford, MA City Council - Jan. 10, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2652.905s">Hi,</a> I'm Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2655.728s">I</a> just wanted to come up with, everyone has mentioned development. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2659.531s">Of</a> course, I'm gonna mention development as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2661.733s">But</a> the thing is that all the new developers that come into the city commission the traffic study. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2667.097s">For</a> their area, all the traffic studies come out the same, nobody has cars, and there's going to be no increase in traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2673.303s">But</a> what they don't tell us is that as a city, we are allowed to turn to that developer and ask them to pay for a traffic study, our own independent traffic study, to determine if that is actually true. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2685.034s">And</a> that's something that we should definitely be exercising. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2688.858s">I</a> believe Malden was planning to ask the Malden Hospital to pay for a traffic study for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2693.243s">I</a> know that in the meeting that you all had, the ad hoc committee meeting, you did say that that was a possibility of asking Malden Hospital to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2702.335s">for</a> traffic study for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2704.417s">And</a> MPAC right now is doing their grant and they're suggesting changing three of the streets in the square possibly to being two-way streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2713.605s">So</a> I imagine they must have gotten a traffic study. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2716.287s">So</a> there's a lot of things going on that perhaps we need to get involved in because the piecemeal approach isn't working. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2723.033s">I'd</a> hate to see Salem Street, Riverside, Clippership all of a sudden be two-way streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2727.338s">because</a> they think that's going to be better for the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2729.679s">And</a> then it trickles out into all the other areas and makes everything else worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2733.601s">So</a> that's just the big thing is that if things are going on, we should attach ourselves to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2738.923s">If</a> there is money available from developers, maybe we should be, if we're not immediately doing that study, should be asking for it to be put into a fund for the study. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2748.687s">That</a> will happen at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2750.207s">So</a> just going forward.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3326.169s">Hi,</a> Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3329.232s">I</a> submitted this petition because I find that finding information about what's going on at the Zoning Board of Appeals prior to the meeting is <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3337.328s">Fairly</a> difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3338.729s">I</a> originally found out about the local street project by accident. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3342.57s">I</a> happened to see an email that someone had sent saying that there was a hearing amongst. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3347.332s">It</a> was a 490 residential unit building as well as, you know, someone trying to add onto their driveway. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3356.076s">So</a> it was just thrown in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3357.456s">I've</a> been back and forth through city hall and trying to find different ways to find out what the agenda, when the agenda will be posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3365.245s">Is</a> there a way I can get it emailed to me? <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3368.307s">Is,</a> is there any way that people can really find out other than I heard it's in the paper, but that's not really working out for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3376.273s">But</a> so I think that the best thing to do is since the city council controls the zoning, it would be great if we do not control the zone while you control the zoning ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3387.37s">That</a> would be great if you could draw our attention to the ZBA hearings before they're happening, because a lot of people don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3394.733s">And</a> we're chasing these things after they're happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3397.614s">We</a> currently have four lawsuits for one development, because we're chasing it after it happened, as opposed to having, if we had had 200 or 300 people show up at that hearing, maybe we wouldn't be doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3411.2s">I</a> just think that if we want more people to get involved, <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3414.511s">to</a> make it easier for them to know what's actually happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3417.873s">A</a> lot of people do watch this meeting, people, and people want to know what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3423.656s">So</a> I think we also need to focus on the fact that variances are supposed to be rare, and they're supposed to be good and sufficient cause, according to the Massachusetts Chapter 40, Section 10 laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3436.629s">So,</a> we really need to work on making sure that we're not victimizing the public, as it says in the law, and conflicting with our local laws and ordinances when we're granting these. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3447.194s">So,</a> the next meeting that's coming up is January 25th. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3451.696s">It's</a> at 630. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3452.397s">It's</a> a community development meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3454.858s">It's</a> on the project on Salem Street at the Break Pro. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3457.459s">They've</a> also bought the abutters property to increase their chances of having this passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3462.942s">They've</a> also not shoveled their snow. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3464.522s">So,</a> they're very good neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3466.402s">The</a> following Tuesday will be the ZBA meeting on this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3469.763s">I</a> encourage anyone who's concerned about a project so close to the Roberts elementary school, which is, um, past capacity that this four level building could possibly eclipse their sunlight earlier than it currently is now at one o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3484.626s">The</a> school building obstructs the sunlight in the playground and makes it shaded and colder for the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3491.068s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3491.998s">We</a> need to try to make these people follow our zoning laws, and I hope the City Council will take the lead on keeping distances from buildings, on keeping height, because it's in the best interest of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3503.762s">We're</a> talking about traffic studies, additional cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3506.843s">We're</a> talking about parking issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3509.083s">The</a> streets in that area are permanent only because of traffic issues, car parking that is not available. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3516.906s">So</a> all these things are things that we can do to help ease these transitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3521.788s">uh,</a> butters know about these things ahead of time, not just the butters, but people that live in the neighborhood that will be affected by these projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3527.97s">Then</a> we can get ahead of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3529.011s">We'll</a> get a more active community. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3531.832s">We'll</a> get that open, transparent government that everyone campaigned on last year and we can all try to make Medford a better place to live. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3539.855s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2017-01-08_Yqa0Po2dZcA/2017-01-08_Yqa0Po2dZcA.html">Medford, MA City Council - Jan. 3, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6717.042s">Hi,</a> I'm shower Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6718.183s">I</a> live at 281 Park street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6720.204s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6721.44s">Variances</a> are a very interesting thing in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6724.222s">Anyone</a> who's tried to add a deck, a shed, or anything onto their house knows that it can be quite expensive to get a variance, quite timely, and oftentimes you're refused. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6732.788s">But</a> what I've noticed in the trend of attending meetings for the past seven months is that if you're a developer, <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6738.444s">and</a> you want to come in and change the entire shape of a property and build something completely different, tear down a supermarket and put 490 units, that project will glide through fairly easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6750.189s">And</a> that's not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6752.009s">Variances</a> are supposed to be very difficult to get. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6754.571s">There's</a> supposed to be a demonstrated hardship before variance is granted. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6758.672s">You're</a> not just supposed to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6760.833s">Well,</a> I'll make less money if I don't do it this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6763.335s">That's</a> not a hardship. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6764.636s">That's</a> not how a variance is supposed to be granted. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6767.638s">These</a> variances are flying out right now on Salem Street where we're looking at break pro is going to be turned and they want to build two floors over over what they're allowed to build and their reason for it is because they want to make more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6782.048s">There's</a> no reason that there's a problem with the property that they need to build higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6787.128s">They</a> just want variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6788.609s">It's</a> not just use variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6789.93s">It's</a> lots of variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6791.411s">If</a> you go to the planning meetings for the square, you'll hear, we want mixed use. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6795.915s">We</a> want lots of residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6797.336s">They</a> want to change the use of the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6799.418s">But</a> if you hear the people when they invite us and ask us what we want, we're not asking for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6805.302s">We're</a> not saying, well, what we really need is, you know, 2,000 more students in our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6810.226s">You</a> know, the second grade at the Roberts was closed this year because the class sizes reached 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6815.128s">The</a> third grade has five classes, and their classes are over 20, 22, 23 per class, because the balance of the building is happening on the east side of town. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6826.012s">So</a> any talk about zoning needs to include, is one side getting hammered? <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6830.794s">Yes,</a> we have the 200 going on Middle Six Avenue, not a small project, 200 condos. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6836.336s">We</a> have potentially, <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6839.25s">490</a> on Lucas Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6841.131s">We</a> have 324 opening up right near Wellington. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6845.532s">All</a> of those people will siphon into those streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6848.814s">They'll</a> siphon into the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6850.314s">They'll</a> siphon into the McGlynn, and those schools can't take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6853.242s">while</a> we look at the other side of town with class sizes of 16 and 17, and we add them together and say, oh, the average is under 20. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6860.625s">It's</a> not. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6861.145s">We</a> really need to look at what's happening here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6863.446s">We</a> also need to balance our commercial and our residential properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6867.008s">We</a> can't keep turning our commercial into residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6869.829s">The</a> cost of a residence is far more than the cost of commercial to our infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6874.871s">You'll</a> never, ever see Hallmark Health send a student to our elementary school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6880.262s">you</a> will definitely see that happen out of a residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6883.064s">So</a> we really need to look at not only our uses, but also why are we granting variances so easily? <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6890.969s">I</a> think the only thing I saw that failed in the past seven months was the project on Salem Street and Haynes Square where he was proposing building units on top of a storefront with zero parking and said that they could use the street or stop and shop and that was turned down. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6907.04s">But</a> other projects are pushing through. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6910.288s">without</a> concern for the neighbors around. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6912.929s">If</a> the Salem Street project pushes through, the Roberts Elementary School schoolyard will not see the sun in the winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6919.291s">Because</a> right now, their own building is four stories, and by one o'clock, there's no more sun. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6925.194s">That</a> building will be at least one floor higher, and it will cast us into shadow by probably about 11 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6930.836s">The</a> children will be out in recess, in shadow. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6936.138s">It's</a> not just about what the mayor wants. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6937.639s">I</a> think if you go out and talk to the people, you're going to find that the density is hurting some of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6944.741s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8028.515s">It's</a> been drafted in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8031.953s">OK,</a> and we're waiting on the commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8033.594s">And</a> this project shouldn't take a dollar out of our general money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8036.555s">It</a> should come right out of the CPA funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8038.775s">We've</a> already paid those funds in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8041.116s">And</a> if this is the project that we want to spend the money on, then that's where the money should come. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8045.838s">We</a> have to be leery of some of these grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8048.039s">I</a> do apply for grants as part of my PTO at my daughter's elementary school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8053.4s">And</a> I've seen grants that look great and say, we're going to give you $60,000, and you can put new playground equipment on your school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8061.163s">But</a> you have to provide $150,000 for surfacing and leveling. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8065.625s">And</a> then I say, whoa, we can't do that because we don't have that kind of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8069.287s">That's</a> something that we need to look at here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8070.888s">Grants</a> are great, but we can't afford all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8072.889s">And</a> we have to be choosy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8074.53s">And</a> if we have a fund that's sitting there ripe for projects like this, then that's something we should tap into. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8079.572s">Is</a> that something that we can retroactively tap into here? <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8082.694s">Or</a> is that just money that's going to come out of the general fund and it's just gone?

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1743.044s">Hi,</a> my name is Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1744.525s">I</a> live at 281 Park Street and I'm glad that this issue is coming out, but I think what's really important is we don't have the mass support community advisory committee person. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1753.789s">So</a> when they do meet, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1755.338s">They</a> ask everyone who's there, I would assume, are you suffering from noise? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1760.124s">And</a> if no one from Medford raises their hand, then when they give mitigation to others, they'll give punishment to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1767.013s">So</a> we need to be really on top of this because I've followed this since they changed the traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1773.626s">over</a> two years ago now, and Milton was the first one at the charge that complained. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1778.39s">Now,</a> they're very close to the airport, because I hear a lot of complaints from the city that, oh, it's OK, we're in the city, and that's the price of living in the city is airplane noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1787.036s">Milton</a> is closer than we are to the airport. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1789.018s">Their</a> lowest plane is 6,000 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1791.38s">Our</a> lowest plane is 2,500 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1794.362s">So</a> they have already gotten it raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1796.924s">When</a> the initial findings came out, their planes were supposed to be at 5,000 feet, and they complained. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1802.372s">and</a> they were elevated to 6,000 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1804.753s">So</a> the big question is, how come they can go to 6,000 feet there, but we can't even hit 5,000 here? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1810.714s">So</a> we really need to start complaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1812.774s">And</a> if nobody wants to go to that meeting on December 1st, I would love to attend that meeting, because my daughter is on daily medication from the plane noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1819.496s">Last</a> night as we laid in bed at 11.30 at night, we got a symphony of planes that lasted for approximately one hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1826.577s">We're</a> tired. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1827.498s">We</a> would like the planes to be quiet. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1829.34s">We're</a> tired of it being our turn. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1830.721s">We're</a> tired of the 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1831.843s">wake-up</a> calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1832.603s">We're</a> tired of the 60 to 90-second intervals of the low-flying planes. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1837.548s">And</a> we need somebody that's going to beat the drum for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1840.271s">And</a> they need to beat it loudly. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1842.553s">I</a> really encourage somebody to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1843.974s">As</a> many people as can go, let's send all those people there. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1846.875s">Let's</a> try and tell them that, you know, Medford isn't the dumping ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1850.277s">We</a> are the pivot point for these planes. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1851.838s">These</a> planes fly over Medford, they accelerate, and they turn onto other areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1856.32s">Where</a> do they turn? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1857.021s">They</a> turn to Belmont. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1857.961s">So</a> Belmont gets a fraction of the planes that fly over Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1861.223s">They</a> turn to Watertown. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1862.724s">They</a> turn to all these towns that are going in and complaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1865.826s">So</a> we're getting nine, ten times the amount of planes that they're getting and we're just saying that's all right because this is the price of living in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1873.269s">It's</a> not the price of living in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1874.89s">I'm</a> not willing to give you my quality of life because I live in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1878.592s">So</a> somebody needs to stand up for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1881.013s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2938.025s">Hi,</a> I'm Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2939.167s">I</a> live at 281 Park street. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2940.889s">My</a> daughter attends the Roberts elementary. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2942.632s">I</a> was part of the first parent group that helped to deal with the drop off patterns. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2949.261s">I</a> didn't get everything that I wanted, but I did get some of the things. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2952.025s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2952.592s">I'm</a> back because I think that some of the places that we went wrong, we should probably include parents in this as well, this meeting, because we're the ones that are dropping off the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2963.86s">I</a> know a lot of the parents that have to drop off on the street now are concerned that they're not able to go into the loop anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2970.745s">We</a> do have the sawhorses at either side of the parking lot, but it's big enough that people can go around and people are using it as a cut-through. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2980.702s">The</a> kindergartners have to be brought in hand into the school and so that's over 100 parents that are dropping off every morning and picking up every afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2989.53s">So</a> I'm hopeful that if we do do something we can notify the neighbors because like I said I do live on Park Street and I see my neighbors backing out of their driveways in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2998.179s">and</a> off until close to 840, the traffic is backed up to the Fellsway, and they're not aware that we had a meeting to discuss having the street be one way towards Salem, so they try to duck and play a little Tetris game to get down the street to get to the Fellsway because they were not made aware of that pattern. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3016.948s">So</a> it's really not useful if we're not notifying anyone around. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3020.87s">The</a> crossing guard will turn her back and someone will take a right down park. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3025.032s">I</a> do encourage anything that we do not only go to the parents but also to the neighbours. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3028.636s">So</a> thank you for putting that forward.<h2><a href="../2016-11-10_FmrA4M646Vo/2016-11-10_FmrA4M646Vo.html">Medford School Committee meeting November 7, 2016</a></h2>

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3904.047s">Hi,</a> I'm Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3905.107s">I</a> live at 281 Park Street, which is the street that the Roberts Elementary School is on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3909.849s">Our</a> principal is one of the principals who is out in the parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3913.369s">Our</a> traffic configuration was changed so that the drop-off loop is now parking because our teachers, our school has expanded to the point that we don't have enough parking for our teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3922.832s">They</a> double parked in the parking lot and that overflowed and now they're parked in the <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3927.657s">the</a> drop-off loop, so our kids are further away from the school when they get dropped off. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3931.94s">We</a> have a problem with parents and commuters who've decided that the drop-off loop is a great way to bypass all the cars that are backed up on Park Street down to the Fellsway, so they'll buzz through as the children are trying to cross. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3944.749s">So,</a> our principal has taken to standing at the end of the driveway with his arms crossed in an effort to stop people because my child has been one of the children that has almost been mowed down by someone just whipping through. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3957.647s">either</a> from Court Street all the way across through the loop and out Park Street or through the loop from Park Street to Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3965.236s">So</a> that's a dangerous situation and I'm sure that if you talk to people at the Columbus, if you talk to people at the Andrews, I had a daughter at the McGlynn, there were issues there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3975.473s">So</a> I just think we need to look at all the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3978.154s">I</a> know that the Brooks is having emergent problems right now and I'm happy that they're being addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3983.176s">I</a> just hope that the rest of the schools are involved in the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3986.358s">I</a> know that Mr. Johnson has asked the school committee they announced last night that he had asked for an additional crossing guard to help at the loop area. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3994.481s">I'm</a> not sure what the status of that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3996.502s">I</a> also spoke to Chief Sacco at the community meeting and asked him to look again at our traffic configuration. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4003.68s">And</a> he said he would get back to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4005.041s">I'm</a> not sure what the status is on that either. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4007.244s">So</a> I just want to inject that in the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4010.146s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4696.954s">Hi,</a> I'm Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4700.215s">Um,</a> I spoke at the podium last week about the issue that I, I started to speak about the issue that I had at the community meeting and I was interrupted and everyone that I ran into from Medford this week said, wow, I can't believe that that happened at the city council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4717.078s">So</a> I did some research and found out that in the Roberts Rules of Order, I shouldn't have been interrupted because I had the right to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4724.624s">I</a> wasn't speaking, saying anything inflammatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4727.506s">I</a> was sharing my experience from having gone to that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4731.389s">And</a> so I wanted to come up and say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4735.271s">And</a> I also wanted to share the information that I had from the meeting because I felt that I didn't really get to share it last time because of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4743.373s">One</a> other interesting thing I found out when I was researching the Roberts Rules of Order was that a point of information is when you have a question for the speaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4749.919s">It's</a> not actually to give information. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4752.081s">I</a> was pretty surprised about that, but when I spoke to my 20-year-old college student who is on the student government at her college, she said, of course, mom, everybody knows that, because she had to take a crash course in Roberts Rules of Law in order to be on student government. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4768.544s">I</a> was pretty thrown off when I was interrupted for several minutes, so I just wanted to go back. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4773.908s">When</a> I saw the Facebook post about the meeting being in the neighborhoods, I wanted to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4778.911s">I</a> came straight from the South Medford Economic Transition meeting to that meeting, so I missed the five-minute introduction. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4786.316s">I</a> was sitting in the back of the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4788.277s">The</a> Brooks parents had a very large showing, and I sat for the first hour and heard them discuss their issues on High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4797.632s">After</a> that point, I raised my hand so that I could have an opportunity to speak as everyone else in the room was doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4803.622s">I</a> had my hand up for several minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4805.786s">I</a> swapped my hands back and forth as my arms got tired from being held up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4809.958s">Someone</a> came up behind me and told me to stand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4812.539s">Perhaps</a> he couldn't see me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4813.719s">I</a> did stand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4815.059s">Someone</a> I knew across the room waved at me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4816.92s">I</a> waved my arm. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4817.82s">I</a> still wasn't called on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4820.321s">Three</a> people around me, I actually leaned over and said to Councilor Falco, I think that perhaps they don't want to call on me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4829.589s">And</a> I kept my hand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4831.631s">Three</a> people around me raised their hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4833.972s">They</a> were each called on fairly quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4836.234s">Each</a> said, I just raised my hand so that she could have a turn to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4840.617s">So</a> I did not feel welcome at that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4843.76s">It's</a> pretty known that I live in East Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4848.372s">Maybe</a> that was or was not the reason that I wasn't called on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4852.275s">The</a> only thing that I wished to say at that meeting was what I say when I come here, is that traffic is an issue everywhere in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4859.741s">There</a> are dangerous conditions in other parts of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4863.064s">What</a> they were stressing at that meeting was calling in the mass DOT to meet about High Street, and I wanted to interject that if we were going to have them come down, they would only come down once. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4874.113s">And</a> we should identify all the other mass DOT streets that we have within Medford that have issues and have them all tour those streets at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4884.157s">Because</a> if you go to any school and talk to the parents, they'll all tell you a horror story about a street nearby. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4889.959s">If</a> you go to the senior center, they'll tell you a similar story. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4893.92s">So</a> I wanted to make sure that we got the best that we could for all of Medford, and that was my point speaking then. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4901.382s">At</a> that meeting, we were instructed if we wanted to see accidents, I'm almost done, that we could go on the Mass Highway website and find traffic data. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4909.549s">So</a> the latest data that I could find was from 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4913.032s">I</a> didn't include any Wellington Circle 93 or the <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4917.3s">Rotary</a> that's right out here, I'm not sure the name of it, just because those are things we really can't fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4923.242s">But</a> the big winner, or maybe the loser, depending on how you want to look at it, was Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4928.023s">Main</a> Street had the most accidents, by far, of any other street in our city in 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4932.344s">They</a> had 87 accidents, which I thought was wow. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4936.525s">I</a> haven't heard anybody come in and complain about accidents on Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4940.146s">Salem</a> Street was at 62. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4942.007s">High</a> Street was at 50. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4942.907s">I</a> included the entirety of these streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4946.028s">The</a> Fellsway was at 34. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4947.589s">Riverside,</a> 32. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4949.09s">Boston</a> Ave, 27. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4950.752s">Middlesex</a> Ave, 24. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4952.773s">The</a> Winthrop Circle, the infamous Winthrop Circle, was at 17. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4957.357s">And</a> Locust Street, where we want to put 490 units as well as Wegman, had 14 accidents. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4962.981s">That's</a> a very short strip of street to have 14 accidents in one year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4968.755s">Central</a> lab at the intersection of spring also had 10 accidents that year So I just wanted to point out that there's a lot of issues in the city I know that the police are short-staffed and I know that we're looking to make changes to the infrastructure and that we want to hire someone but Sometimes if you just look at the data and you talk to everyone then you can find out I hope that a lot of people will come to the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4990.748s">I'm</a> not sure the date of the meeting I <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4996.722s">The</a> first Wednesday of the month, November 5th, according to Councilor Falco, and that will be at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=5000.703s">Francis.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=5003.464s">So</a> I encourage everyone to attend and make sure that the city knows everything that's going on because there are a lot of issues and we can't just be quiet and hope that someone will notice and fix them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=5013.267s">So</a> that's all that I can say. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=5014.908s">Thank</a> you for your time.<h2><a

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2795.185s">Hi,</a> my name is Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2796.665s">I</a> live at 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2798.726s">I</a> attended the meeting at the Brooks School. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2803.918s">This</a> is basically, this meeting started from a Facebook post, which seems to be our new way of doing things in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2810.861s">And</a> every parent in this city who's on Medford bombs knows that every September starts with, my child was trying to go to the school bus and almost got killed. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2820.245s">The</a> first one posted was on the Fellsway. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2823.106s">Didn't</a> get much traction. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2824.347s">The</a> parents said, yeah, that's happened to me a million times and nothing happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2828.608s">The</a> one that happened on High Street got more traction. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2831.672s">They</a> have a fabulous organization in West Medford that can really rally people to show up in a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2837.613s">And</a> boy, am I jealous. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2839.835s">I</a> wish I could have 70 people standing behind me today talking about the problems that we have on my side of the city, on other parts of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2847.342s">But</a> the one thing that I got out of that meeting was one of the officers suggested that I go on to the mass.gov website. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2854.569s">He</a> suggested that we all go on and that we could get a copy of all the accidents in the city of Medford for the past three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2861.695s">So</a> I went on this morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2862.956s">I</a> clicked it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2864.057s">Within</a> five minutes, I had an email that had three years of accident statistics from Medford by date, had the intersections and everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2873.704s">I</a> can tell you that the hottest spots are not surprising to anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2877.627s">The</a> Fellsway, Salem Street, Locust Street, I was a little bit surprised. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2882.331s">A</a> lot of accidents on Locust Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2883.852s">Spring</a> Street is a big hot issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2885.713s">Anyone</a> on Medford Moms knows that people are getting hit over there constantly. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2891.903s">What</a> else was it? <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2893.685s">Mystic</a> Ave wasn't too bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2895.406s">High</a> Street had a lot of accidents as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2897.528s">The</a> Winthrop Street Circle had accidents. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2899.609s">There's</a> a lot of hotspots in the city that are not just on High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2904.233s">I</a> mean, I applaud that we had a meeting specifically for High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2907.896s">I'm</a> not sure all the other neighborhoods should have to wait the several months for their meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2912.159s">What</a> if there were more issues on High Street? <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2914.081s">Are</a> they not allowed to go to the community meeting because it's supposed to be focused only on their neighborhood? <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2919.345s">Because</a> that's what's going around.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3095.517s">Thank</a> you for making that clear, because I did attend that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3098.118s">I</a> was late. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3098.558s">I</a> was at the South Medford Economic Development meeting, which I had to leave in the middle of the mayor's remarks to come to that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3105.6s">But</a> I did attend the meeting with that frame of mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3111.502s">I've</a> since been told by others that they thought it was inappropriate to speak of anywhere but their neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3117.804s">So</a> I hope that people heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3119.938s">that</a> this is supposed to be community-wide. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3122.379s">And</a> I hope that at the end of all these meetings that there'll be resolutions about all of these streets and all the neighborhoods, because I did speak about the Fellsway, which I'm sure you're familiar with the Fellsway. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3133.423s">We</a> don't have a crossing guard at all, but I see a resolution on here to add an additional crossing guard to another street. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3139.385s">So</a> I'm not sure how many months people are gonna have to wait before they're gonna see this kind of rapid action. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3145.967s">I</a> mean, 4 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3146.968s">street</a> lining. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3148.528s">and</a> lights being ordered and grant money coming in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3152.091s">I</a> think we need to look at all these streets and we need to look at them quickly and not wait four or six months to get to other neighborhood meetings because there's danger now in other areas of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3163.181s">And</a> I think we're hyper-focused on one street and I hope that that is not going to continue to be the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3169.987s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2016-10-07_3G6bVVGWEWQ/2016-10-07_3G6bVVGWEWQ.html">PART 1 Medford School Committee September 26, 2016 meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8288.999s">Hi,</a> I'm Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8290.159s">I</a> live at 281 Park Street, and I saw this item on the agenda, and in the past couple of months, I've posted a couple of graffiti incidents that happened at the Roberts School. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8302.124s">So</a> I posted for two months, someone had written on the side of the school, and the complaint wasn't acknowledged. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8307.546s">Finally,</a> this past week, a private citizen messaged me and told me that they had gone down to the school with a bucket and water and a scrub brush and cleaned the graffiti off the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8319.5s">which</a> thank you very much for cleaning the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8322.264s">I</a> don't think he should have had to but I appreciate that he did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8325.148s">There's</a> also a pedestrian crossing sign at the school that has had graffiti on it and the bottom rivet is not connected and that's been there for about two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8332.696s">I</a> know several parents have called and complained about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8335.759s">So</a> our DPW, I know, is short-staffed and they really are not able to handle this overflow. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8341.345s">So</a> I think the graffiti issue in the city is probably more of a symptom. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8345.569s">I</a> can also cite an example of businesses on Spring Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8348.653s">I</a> drove down Spring Street and there was someone had written their name about 40 or 50 times on one building on Spring Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8355.988s">And</a> I drove down less than a week later, and the owner had painted over all of it, but that person had graffitied over what he had already painted. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8364.232s">So</a> in the span of a week, he had already painted the entire building. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8369.434s">They</a> wrapped around the entire side of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8371.455s">It</a> was about a foot high, about 40 times. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8374.217s">He</a> signed his name, maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8377.513s">We</a> can find him. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8378.453s">His</a> name's on the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8380.754s">So</a> that's pretty upsetting that the owner was out there that quickly and repaired the damage and then it was done to him again. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8388.897s">Again,</a> this is probably a symptom of a larger issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8391.038s">I</a> know that the police force is down, density is up, and there's less patrol. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8395.959s">So</a> this is a symptom and something that we really need to think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8399.941s">Do</a> we need more DPW? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8401.281s">Do</a> we need more police? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8404.674s">is</a> just a small level crime, but it is something to think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8407.615s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10642.292s">I</a> live at 281 Park Street and I encourage a moratorium on building because sorry right now there are over 800 units that are approved and either under construction or or pending permits and <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10657.382s">And</a> they're all on the side of the city where the McGlynn and the Roberts are. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10662.044s">The</a> McGlynn and the Roberts are the most highly populated schools in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10665.785s">I</a> met with the principal at the Roberts on Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10668.246s">The</a> numbers that he had given to the school committee were 547. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10670.427s">He's</a> now, as of Friday, he was up to 555. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10676.149s">He</a> gets new students almost daily. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10679.07s">That</a> school is very full. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10681.317s">The</a> McGlynn School is at 495. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10683.699s">If</a> you go across town, you'll see the Columbus is at 401, the Brooks is at 449. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10688.643s">So</a> the school populations do need to be considered in approving building projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10694.107s">If</a> 10% of these new units have one child, that's 80 new children, that will go to the Roberts or the Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10703.294s">Schools</a> that, I mean the Roberts or the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10705.356s">Schools</a> that are already having a challenge <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10709.131s">That's</a> the last school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10710.192s">We</a> have you know a second grade class at the Roberts that has 24 students in it So that this these are things that are not considered when the zoning board approves things they don't contact the school department and I <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10724.518s">We're</a> all have hanging over our head Locust Street, which is 490 units being built on six and a half acres. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10731.582s">If</a> you look at every city that surrounds Medford that is opposing a building project right now, those projects are all on 12, 14, 18 acres of land and slightly over 300. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10742.507s">They</a> were all denied as too dense. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10745.509s">But</a> we approved 490 units on six and a half acres with residents standing up and screaming no. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10754.982s">They</a> just pulled the Salem Street development, which he wants 25 units on 18,000 square feet, which is, I think, 100 feet from the Roberts Elementary School, and he wants to put 27 parking spaces, but he's withdrawing because he's waiting because we all heard about the possibility of 40R. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10773.865s">I</a> just got the schedule for the Zoning Board of Appeals meeting next week, and someone on Main Street wants to tear down, it's either a one or a two-family house, and put up 12 units. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10784.498s">The</a> meeting that I attended in June, they had someone who wanted to tear down a single-family house and put up a seven-family. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10791.584s">So</a> even if you put a moratorium on 25, taking one family and turning it into seven or 10 or 12 is exploding our population. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10803.153s">I</a> went to the Traffic Commission meeting last week, and the people are in saying, you know, I live next door to a two-family house. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10808.838s">They</a> have 15 cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10810.479s">They</a> have no parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10811.776s">They're</a> all in the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10812.797s">I</a> think they're running a rooming house. <a

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=2947.365s">I</a> live at 2d1 Park Street and <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=2949.342s">You</a> guys were really fast. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=2950.762s">I</a> threw out my back, so it took me a little longer to get here. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=2954.044s">You</a> got through the rights pond thing already, which was what I had come in to speak on. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=2958.905s">I</a> know you don't want to hear it, but that's too bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=2961.446s">The</a> opening weekend was on June 25th, and I attended the pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=2964.807s">And</a> they had hourly safety checks after 3 p.m., where they kicked everyone out of the beach because all the lifeguards needed to have breaks at the exact same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=2973.623s">I</a> sent several, I made several calls and emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=2977.145s">They</a> were all returned from the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=2979.205s">I</a> had contacted the parks department because I've been going to the ponds for over 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=2982.827s">This</a> was a new rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=2986.068s">Jeanne</a> Camuso told me that these checks were a mandate from the Red Cross. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=2991.471s">So</a> I called the Red Cross. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=2992.671s">The</a> Red Cross says we don't make mandates. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=2994.232s">We</a> just do training. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=2997.91s">Not</a> sure why she would have said that. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=2999.091s">And</a> then I read the lifeguard manual. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3000.752s">I</a> was lifeguard trained in my youth and they recommended rotations of lifeguards at 20 to 30 minute intervals so that they don't, their eyes don't glaze over. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3008.916s">I</a> don't know what the exact language was, just to keep them moving around. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3012.818s">They</a> did not recommend hourly breaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3014.859s">No</a> job recommends hourly breaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3017.3s">On</a> the 4th of July weekend, <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3019.245s">I</a> tried to go to the pond again, and I was turned away. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3022.368s">I</a> was told that they were at capacity of 70. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3024.45s">My</a> mother and daughter were already in the pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3026.352s">I</a> texted them to say that I was not able to get in. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3029.234s">They</a> told me there were less than 30 people in the pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3031.756s">So</a> even when the crisis of having 70 people at the pond had passed, they did not allow more people into the pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3041.1s">On</a> Tuesday, July 7th, we had the first MFN concert. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3043.881s">If</a> we're only going to allow 70 people in the pond, perhaps we can't have these events because a lot of people do come on that night that don't wish to purchase a pass and swim. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3052.923s">And</a> if we're going to shut it off at 70 for people that have paid for a pass, we probably can't have more than 150 were there on the July 7th. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3062.201s">On</a> Saturday, July 16th, I again attempted to go to the pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3066.604s">At</a> 4.30, I went by. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3068.046s">I</a> was told it was closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3069.467s">At</a> 6 o'clock, I drove by again. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3071.068s">It</a> was still closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3072.489s">I</a> find it hard to believe that during that time, no one had left the pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3077.053s">So</a> I called and spoke to Linda this time at the mayor's office, and although she was very polite, she told me that it must have been for safety and told me that it was a DCR mandate. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3088.509s">So</a> I read up on the Massachusetts law on DCR, which is number 302 under section 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3095.331s">There's</a> no regulations for Cassidy at beaches. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3098.052s">I</a> also looked at every single beach controlled by the DCR. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3101.953s">None</a> of them had capacity limitations in any of their rules.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3113.676s">Which</a> is part of my point, because that's the answer that I was given by the City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3118.048s">that</a> they're pulling at straws, just attempting to give me an answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3123.538s">I</a> know when I used to call the mayor, the old mayor, I would speak to Rose, and if she didn't know the answer, she would say, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3129.562s">Let</a> me get back to you, which would have been a very acceptable answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3133.344s">It</a> would have been the preferred answer, because most citizens won't say, oh, it's a Red Cross mandate. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3138.247s">Well,</a> let me look up and see what the Red Cross mandate is. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3141.229s">I</a> did. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3142.05s">Called</a> back. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3142.63s">It's</a> not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3143.671s">Then</a> I get, it's a DCR mandate. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3145.932s">Again,</a> research. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3146.973s">Find</a> out. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3147.553s">It's</a> not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3148.454s">Most</a> people just say, oh, that must be the rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3150.835s">That</a> rule stinks, and I don't like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3153.765s">So</a> my biggest issue is that they seem to want to protect the new person. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3158.348s">Her</a> name is Helen. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3160.169s">I</a> was told by the Parks Department that she was hired by the mayor, which is fine, but she needs to learn how to do her job and do it properly.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3173.457s">No,</a> it isn't criticism.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3178.775s">I</a> think my manner is pretty appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3180.335s">I</a> said that I don't mind who hired her, but I do feel that she should learn to do her job. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3184.737s">If</a> she is saying that this is a Red Cross mandate and or a DCR mandate, then she does not know her job. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3189.638s">I</a> have researched these laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3190.718s">You</a> are welcome to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3192.139s">I</a> would be more than happy to provide you with links to read them. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3195.159s">I've</a> spent quite a bit of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3196.2s">I</a> read the Lifeguard. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3197.56s">I</a> read the management manual. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3198.7s">I</a> read the lifeguard training manual. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3200.041s">I've</a> gone through lifeguard training. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3201.441s">I</a> read the DCR regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3203.862s">So</a> now I've learned that the mayor has posted information that she has decided that the pond is now a pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3211.425s">The</a> reason why the pond is a pool is because there are ropes around the swimming area. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3215.706s">That's</a> not what a pool is. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3217.067s">A</a> pool is not a body of water that's on, I believe she said, 148 acres. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3226.537s">I'm</a> concerned that we have a mayor now that can make ponds into pools. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3232.882s">She</a> said it's 148 acres, according to her Facebook page, and they're going to be going by the regulations of CMR 105-435.23, which is about lifeguards in a swimming pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3247.347s">It</a> also states that if you go further down to the bathing capacity, section 27, the bathing capacity is anything under five feet is considered non-swimmable. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3256.149s">Anyone</a> who's been to Wright's Pond knows that the entire swimming area of Wright's Pond is a non-swimming area. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3261.749s">It's</a> under five feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3263.11s">So</a> the regulation would be that each person in the water would need a minimum of 10 square feet of swimming space, which is a capacity greater than 75. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3272.651s">So</a> I would welcome you to <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3277.398s">please</a> have the pond turned back into a pond and not a pool to... Point of information, Councilor Knight.

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5807.837s">Hi,</a> I'm Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5811.32s">I</a> live at 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5815.022s">I</a> was the subject of the meeting this morning for the complaint. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5818.978s">If</a> anyone doesn't know yet, I think everyone knows, but I attended that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5823.879s">There</a> were more than a dozen residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5825.92s">Every</a> seat in that room was full. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5828.461s">And</a> the abutters were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5830.161s">They're</a> here tonight again. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5831.241s">I</a> recognize them. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5832.322s">All</a> stood up and said what address they lived on on Cumming Street and that they were opposed to this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5838.303s">At</a> approximately 10.30, Chairman Arena said, we have over 1,000 pages of documentation to review. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5845.7s">and</a> we will be taking this matter under advisement. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5848.342s">At</a> that point, all the citizens and the attorneys, the entire Equity One Army, they brought almost as many people as we had, about 15 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5858.597s">Rose</a> exited the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5861.319s">No</a> words were spoken by anyone on this board until the room was cleared. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5866.202s">We</a> were in the hallway, and Dennis McDool, I guess their secretary, came, closed the door, and said, we have much to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5874.248s">We</a> were not invited into the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5875.809s">We</a> did not know what was happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5878.41s">I</a> am not an attorney, as Chairman Arena told me this morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5882.613s">I</a> knew, but he reminded me. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5884.555s">So</a> I don't know all the rules of open meeting laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5886.676s">When</a> someone closes a door and says we have much to discuss, a reasonable person would assume that you're not invited into this room. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5895.362s">At</a> that point, and every member of the board gave a different amount of time, either 20, 45, or 90 minutes later, 90 minutes would make it June 1st, because the meeting adjourned after 1030, they made the decision to unanimously <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5910.393s">passed</a> all the variances, 11 variances, unprecedented amount of variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5916.035s">And</a> in their haste to beat you all today, they sent out their certificate with an incorrect address on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5924.899s">So</a> they've actually granted a variance to build 490 units at 361 Locust Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5928.5s">I</a> don't know where that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5939.563s">I</a> think that may be in the middle of the Mystic, which I'm cool with if they want to build it there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5946.968s">But,</a> you know, the race was on. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5948.789s">They</a> were very gleeful this morning that, you know, we're done with this complaint and we'll be filing it right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5955.413s">And</a> when I said, well, there is a hearing, a meeting going on at City Council tonight, they'll be discussing this, and Chairman Noreen giggled. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5963.238s">Several</a> times during the meeting, he said, you know, it was a very informal discussion to vote to approve these variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5969.443s">And</a> he very proudly said, I believe I said, let's rock and roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5972.705s">People,</a> did I say let's rock and roll before we voted on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5976.128s">So</a> he clearly does not take this seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5979.75s">He</a> doesn't, he didn't take the consideration of any of the citizenry. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5983.953s">And</a> if you read this report, this decision, it reads 100% as if he works for the developer. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5993.132s">I</a> mean, let's start on page six. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5996.656s">The</a> land is contaminated since the 90s. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6000.219s">It's</a> not allowed to be used for residential housing with gardens or playgrounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6005.545s">It</a> continues on to page seven, but hey, it'd be really expensive if he had to clean the site, so we're just going to pave it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6013.293s">Didn't</a> we just fix the land on the DPW? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6015.655s">I</a> believe I sat in meetings where the estimates that the consultants exceeded $500,000 for the cleaning, but they're not going to clean it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6024.781s">Now</a> my kid can't play here, but somebody else's kid is going to live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6029.524s">So</a> in 10 years, will we be back that these children are developing cancer? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6035.397s">I'm</a> concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6036.158s">They're</a> not concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6038.441s">If</a> you turn over to page 8, the zoning ordinance says if we make them follow the law, it will be a substantial hardship, financial or otherwise, to the appellate. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6046.289s">I'm</a> sorry, this is a board that works for the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6050.957s">I</a> don't care how much money the developer makes. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6053.238s">How</a> much is this going to cost me in extra police? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6055.979s">Are</a> we going to have the extra police? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6057.199s">Are</a> we going to be short? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6057.96s">Are</a> we going to have enough firemen? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6059.48s">If</a> something's going on over there and then something happens on the other side of the city, are we going to be short? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6064.022s">Are</a> the schools going to be overrun? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6065.803s">These</a> are the things that I'm concerned about. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6067.423s">I'm</a> not concerned about the man living on Park Avenue in New York City and if he loses a zero off of his project. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6076.246s">The</a> literal enforcement of this would reduce the project's capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6080.95s">So</a> there would be a substantial loss of dwelling units. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6085.712s">Again,</a> I really, I'm not concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6088.753s">Why</a> is it that this project is approved and practically applauded when in West Medford 30 units was too much? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6098.397s">Way</a> too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6099.617s">Come</a> back with something smaller. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6100.958s">This</a> is 490 units and on page nine it says it's a vibrant mixed use <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6108.166s">project,</a> 7,000 square feet total retail. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6113.391s">3,000</a> will be the existing Eastern Bank, which they'll move to the other side of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6117.055s">So</a> we're talking 4,000 square feet of retail, convenience retail. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6121.699s">When</a> someone asked at that meeting, would this be a coffee shop possibly? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6125.803s">Oh,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6126.764s">We're</a> not going to have a coffee shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6128.385s">So</a> I think we're looking at a convenience store and a dry cleaner. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6131.108s">That's</a> a fabulous addition to the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6133.911s">This</a> is the stations landing type development that Burke promised us in the article in the transcript before the May 18th meeting of the Community Coalition. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6143.621s">A</a> dry cleaner in a convenience store? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6147.766s">I</a> don't know why anyone would want this or say this is anything like stations landing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6152.15s">These</a> are rental units. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6154.724s">Millennials,</a> I can tell you they own cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6157.149s">They're</a> going to park here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6158.832s">They</a> want us to pay to build paths to Hormel so they can park their extra cars there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6163.783s">They</a> want us to pay to build a path to Cumming Street so these residents can have them walking through as they go to park in the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6169.744s">They're</a> charging for the extra parking space for anyone that wants an extra parking space and units. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6175.085s">So</a> they'll be paying approximately $3,000 a month for a two-bedroom and an untold amount for a parking space. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6181.207s">Do</a> you think that they'll stay on their property or do you think that they'll explore the neighborhood and start parking there? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6191.168s">This</a> board did not consider the needs of the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6193.529s">They</a> did not consider the needs of the city, and the developers will come. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6197.511s">They'll</a> say, this is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6199.872s">May</a> 18th, they had a meeting, and the community development people said, oh, you're going to expand the water line? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6204.454s">We'll</a> give you a $950,000 credit. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6206.115s">Done</a> deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6208.016s">Can</a> we vote on it now? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6209.276s">I</a> was at that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6210.156s">That</a> is literally what was said. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6213.178s">May</a> 31st, all the residents said no, and apparently, <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6218.65s">This</a> board does not work for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6220.831s">They</a> work for the developer, because if you read this report, it reads like their attorney wrote it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6225.714s">Oh,</a> it's going to cost us money. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6227.275s">Oh,</a> we're going to make less money. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6229.197s">That's</a> not the concern of a Medford board. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6231.738s">These</a> boards need to work for Medford, or maybe it's time to step aside. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6235.961s">Chairman</a> Arena has been on this board for more than two decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6238.422s">Maybe</a> it's time to go.

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4261.375s">Hi,</a> I'm Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4262.575s">I</a> live at 281 Park Street, which may not sound like in a butter, but I am a perfect cut through from the Fellsway to Riverside will lead right to this development. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4270.878s">I</a> attended both meetings, the community development meeting and the zoning board meeting and Bill Brown, Park Avenue, New York represented equity one. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4280.081s">And</a> the statement that is ringing in my ears from that meeting at the end, he turned around and looked right at us. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4286.323s">All</a> the citizens who'd sat there for an hour and a half presentation, <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4290.388s">And</a> then he got a rebuttal after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4292.99s">And</a> he said, it's coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4295.651s">Just</a> deal with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4296.792s">It</a> may not be me, but it's coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4299.414s">You</a> live in Medford, you're close to Boston, and people are going to build and build and build. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4306.619s">My</a> response to that was, no, Medford's going to say no. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4310.561s">We're</a> not going to let anybody come in and build anything they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4314.524s">We're</a> going to have some common sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4317.175s">Unfortunately,</a> I was wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4319.156s">But</a> some of the things that he asked for and is granted, I did speak to Dennis McGonnell, I believe it is, and he said that this has passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4330.744s">They</a> just haven't had time to write it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4332.765s">He</a> is adding over 1,000 toilets to Locust Street, and the city engineer asked him to expand the water line. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4340.31s">He</a> said, sure, I'll expand the water line. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4341.971s">It'll</a> cost me about $950,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4342.851s">I'd</a> like that deducted directly from my linkage fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4347.729s">The</a> city said yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4349.55s">He</a> said, I'd also like to build a path to get to Freedom Way, probably because the people renting those units don't want to pay for the second parking space if they want, and he's going to charge rent for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4360.614s">They'll</a> park at Hormel. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4362.458s">He</a> also wants to, the city is going to pay for that pathway because it's cheaper for him to build it, but he shouldn't have to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4368.3s">He</a> also wants to build a path to Cummings. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4370.8s">Someone</a> from Spring Street said, is that so people can park on Spring Street? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4375.442s">He</a> asked the city to pay for that because it's on city property, so he shouldn't have to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4380.663s">He</a> wants to give the city nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4382.584s">He</a> wants to take everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4384.25s">He</a> thinks nobody drives, but he's building 781 parking spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4388.912s">He</a> said that the community will not be coming onto this property because he's going to build 7,000 square feet of retail, but it's just going to be convenience. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4397.876s">Someone</a> said, will that include a coffee shop? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4399.677s">He</a> said, no, that won't include a coffee shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4401.918s">So</a> we're talking convenience store dry cleaner, possibly, and an Eastern Bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4406.342s">So</a> we're going to have three new driveways that are going to feed traffic onto Locust. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4410.485s">His</a> traffic study only included Locust Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4413.747s">No</a> other streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4415.569s">This</a> is going to impact Riverside. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4417.05s">This</a> is going to impact 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4418.131s">This</a> is going to impact Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4419.632s">This</a> is going to impact the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4421.273s">This</a> is going to impact everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4423.435s">It's</a> too large. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4425.526s">More</a> of the room was full of residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4427.547s">It</a> was 85 degrees. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4428.547s">They</a> turned the lights out on us so they could show their PowerPoint presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4432.389s">We</a> all sat and we waited and we waited and we all said, we're not opposed to development here. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4438.292s">We</a> were told in the transcript article, it said the mayor was expecting a stations landing type development. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4443.854s">This</a> is not a stations landing type development. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4446.415s">It's</a> too big. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4447.556s">It</a> needs to be scaled back. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4448.856s">We</a> need to consider the needs of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4450.957s">The</a> schools are already crowded. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4453.485s">And</a> they're building a pathway to Freedom Way. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4455.205s">You</a> think that's not because they're going to have children in the schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4457.786s">It</a> is. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4458.366s">We</a> need to consider this. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4460.027s">Seriously,</a> we need to stop this, or everyone else will keep coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4464.368s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_6YHU7Hws2SA/2025-03-21_6YHU7Hws2SA.html">Medford, MA City Council - May 17, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8084.976s">This</a> is the side of the street where the houses are on.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8088.797s">Now</a> he wants the other sidewalk.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8091.857s">But</a> he's been parking on that sidewalk for five years.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8100.86s">Which</a> is a darn shame, because it broke the new street as they drive up onto the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8104.7s">I'm</a> just telling you what it is.
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8110.482s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8113.423s">Actually,</a> Mayor McGlynn said that he didn't agree to that to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8117.087s">The</a> person that worked for the DPW said, let's just put this in at an angle. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8120.311s">And</a> then they just claimed it because they had parked on that side of the street before and wished to continue to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8125.647s">There</a> was no ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8126.988s">I</a> don't remember an ordinance coming through and saying, hey, does everyone agree that we won't have a sidewalk? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8131.41s">Because</a> I spent five years of my life meeting with the mayor, meeting with the DPW, meeting with the chief of police to have a path built so that people could walk on that side of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8140.876s">They</a> paved in the path in street material. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8144.738s">I</a> don't know why. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8145.938s">And</a> the very next day, those cars were parked on the path and the sidewalk because they wanted both. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8151.6s">Then</a> I spent another year going back to have a fence put so we could have a path. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8156.081s">Now</a> when they plow their parking platform, they put the snow on the path. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8161.063s">So</a> someone, I don't think we need to wait for someone to get hit by a car. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8164.544s">I</a> think we need to get the cars off the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8166.125s">I</a> think it's basic. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8167.125s">The</a> kindergartners walk by and they say, Mommy, why are there people parked on the sidewalk? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8171.792s">The</a> mayor said, oh, this is terrible, and we'll take care of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8175.253s">The</a> guy's still on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8176.473s">They</a> told me they gave him an exception. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8178.814s">So</a> now he has both sides of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8181.355s">So</a> I'm going to park on the sidewalk in front of my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8183.756s">I</a> mean, that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8185.416s">Because</a> they said, because it's easier for his mom, that they can park on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8189.097s">I've</a> never seen this woman get in the car. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8190.778s">I've</a> always seen a younger person get in the car. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8194.319s">So</a> before someone gets hurt, maybe you should not worry about <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8199.35s">paving</a> or putting in paint on the ground if we can't get cars off the sidewalk.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_6eg7OrlpwNA/2025-03-21_6eg7OrlpwNA.html">Medford, MA City Council - Apr. 26, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=186.948s">We</a> do not. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=187.668s">All</a> students voted that the final theme is the many cultures of the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=192.69s">Last</a> week, in one day, our teacher asked everyone in their country of origin, and we had 41 countries from one day. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=199.713s">So</a> they're going to have to design something to try to incorporate all those cultures. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=203.575s">They'll</a> be a record of them coming out. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=205.856s">The</a> project is supposed to start in May. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=210.558s">They'll</a> all come together make one they'll be mounted on like separate bars So they'll be able to be removed if so it won't damage the wall But they'll be supported and we have talked to the buildings department to make sure it's safely installed. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=237.304s">They'll</a> be installed
 <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=388.523s">I</a> did go into Blick personally, and they said they had never heard of that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=392.444s">Someone</a> did make me aware that this program exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=395.024s">So</a> that is something I'm still exploring. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=397.865s">We</a> also have a membership to extras for creative reuse, which I recommend for all the art teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=403.506s">$80</a> for the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=404.006s">You</a> can go in 10 times and take as much as you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=406.407s">I've</a> gone in and gotten a lot of tile that we'll be incorporating into the mosaic. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=411.548s">We</a> also use that for the art show, and we're using that for our science night, so it really cuts our supply costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=416.31s">So</a> I'm doing as much as I can to mitigate the costs, but there will be some.
