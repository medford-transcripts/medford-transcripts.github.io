 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1IVQe-XX6k0&t=2433.492s">Hi,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1IVQe-XX6k0&t=2434.413s">I'm</a> Milva McDonald at 61 Monument Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/1IVQe-XX6k0&t=2438.499s">First,</a> I just want to thank everyone who's been working so hard on this for the last few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/1IVQe-XX6k0&t=2444.634s">Commissioner</a> McGivern, Director Hunt, the Solid Waste Task Force, Garbage to Garden, and our Solid Waste Consultant. <a href="https://youtu.be/1IVQe-XX6k0&t=2451.961s">I</a> think it's really impressive the way you've been able to come up with a plan that addresses our climate goals as well as the budget issues the city is going to be facing. <a href="https://youtu.be/1IVQe-XX6k0&t=2464.804s">I've</a> read a little bit about pay-as-you-throw programs, and I believe I read that it's over 160 communities in Massachusetts that have them. <a href="https://youtu.be/1IVQe-XX6k0&t=2473.012s">And</a> the statistic that I saw on the MassDEP website said that in pay-as-you-throw communities, households produce 32% less trash, and that's pretty considerable. <a href="https://youtu.be/1IVQe-XX6k0&t=2485.644s">So</a> I'm really excited that we're moving towards this. <a href="https://youtu.be/1IVQe-XX6k0&t=2490.109s">I</a> think that not all pay-as-you-throw communities are able to offer free composting, so that really, I think, gives Medford a chance to do maybe even better than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1IVQe-XX6k0&t=2501.997s">And</a> I am really proud to live in a city that's been a leader in terms of environmental issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/1IVQe-XX6k0&t=2509.121s">We</a> composted for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/1IVQe-XX6k0&t=2510.922s">I</a> had four children at home, and I know it's hard to reduce trash, but even with my four kids at home, we never filled up our bin. <a href="https://youtu.be/1IVQe-XX6k0&t=2518.867s">And</a> I'm excited that you're going to be giving programs that are going to help people <a href="https://youtu.be/1IVQe-XX6k0&t=2524.01s">sort</a> of address some of the challenges of making less trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/1IVQe-XX6k0&t=2528.713s">I</a> see this as very positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/1IVQe-XX6k0&t=2530.293s">I</a> don't see it as a reduction in services because the free composting to me is a huge increase in services. <a href="https://youtu.be/1IVQe-XX6k0&t=2536.357s">And</a> I think that we're going to see some issues, but it's clear that we can address problems as they arise. <a href="https://youtu.be/1IVQe-XX6k0&t=2543.92s">And</a> I'm glad to see Citi listening and taking people's concerns seriously and working to address them. <a href="https://youtu.be/1IVQe-XX6k0&t=2550.504s">So</a> thank you to everyone who's worked on this.<h2><a href="../2025-10-06_XXXXXX00140/2025-10-06_XXXXXX00140.html">Charter Ballot Question</a></h2>
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=81.324s">Yes,</a> thank you so much, Danielle. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=82.905s">It's</a> really great to be back on the podcast. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=85.848s">I'm</a> Milva McDonald, and my pronouns are she, her. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=90.532s">And</a> the restaurant question, I've been thinking about that, but you haven't asked it yet.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=126.637s">Yeah,</a> well, it's hard to pick one favorite, and I've said different things last time. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=131.178s">I</a> said the farmer's market, which is still a great choice. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=135.32s">I</a> do like the Thai restaurant in Medford Square, Tom Young Kun. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=141.181s">And</a> I like, I mean, I like the Pad Thai. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=144.642s">I</a> like curry. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=145.643s">I</a> like the massaman curry.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=196.249s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=196.949s">Um,</a> so where we are right now is we are at the final step, which is the voters. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=204.012s">Um,</a> and the, the charter was the mayor appointed a committee, which you and I were both on. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=209.754s">We</a> spent almost two years doing public engagement or review, reviewing the charter, going through an article by article, the mayor and the city council then, um, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=221.248s">had</a> a negotiation, they worked through it, they made some changes, they came to an agreement, and then it was sent to the State House as a home rule petition, which is basically a bill. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=231.575s">So</a> it has to go through the process of any bill. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=235.337s">And</a> so it went through the House, it went through the Senate. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=238.659s">The</a> Senate had a few very minor changes, nothing substantive, just details, but that meant it had to go back to the House. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=248.822s">And</a> then it went back to the Senate, and then the governor signed it in mid-September, and that means the next stop is the voters, the ballot. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=258.886s">And</a> the state reviews it just to ensure that it complies with state law, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=264.145s">You</a> know, it's in alignment with what should be in a charter in Massachusetts, et cetera. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=270.89s">And</a> now the voters get to decide. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=272.331s">And</a> the sample ballot is available on the website for the Charter's ballot question committee, which I know we're going to be talking about. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=284.521s">And</a> it's also on the city website. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=285.862s">So</a> people can actually see what their ballot looks like before they go vote, and they can read the question and the summary.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=306.243s">Okay,</a> that's a great question. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=309.285s">So</a> the city will be putting out some information on their webpage about the question, but we have a ballot question committee and there's a website and it's www.medfordcharternow.com. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=326.456s">It</a> has a link to the current charter, links to the proposed charter, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=332.568s">Link</a> to the ballot so you can see it and it and it has summaries of. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=337.51s">You</a> know, kind of what is a charter and what some of the proposed changes in the new charter are so, you know, I mean. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=346.014s">Reading</a> the chart, the propose the current our current charter is very short. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=349.856s">It's</a> about 2 pages. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=350.897s">Um,</a> but the proposed charter is much longer. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=354.739s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=355.739s">And</a> it's comprehensive, whereas our current charter isn't so are the proposed charter is. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=362.4s">40</a> something pages. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=363.261s">So</a> there are summaries for people if they don't want to read the whole thing.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=417.004s">Yeah,</a> absolutely. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=418.525s">But</a> to your point that you just made, I mean, you remember when the Collins Center for Public Management that we worked with on the committee, we were fortunate to have them advising us. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=428.552s">They</a> sort of, we have a memo from them about the complexity of Medford's Charter, which sounds strange because Medford's Charter is only two pages long, right? <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=437.896s">But</a> the reason it's difficult is because there's almost nothing in it. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=444.258s">So</a> any questions that arise, you have to sort of find your way through state law, as you just said, and it can make things confusing. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=456.178s">Yeah,</a> exactly. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=459.58s">So,</a> as far as the major as the changes in the charter, the charter sets out sort of establishes Medford as a city, and it lays out our form of government. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=470.167s">The</a> form of government, which is mayor council will remain, but the changes to the mayor's office are a 4 year term. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=478.372s">Which</a> is trending in Massachusetts and it makes sense for reasons, including, you know, executive tasks are more long term. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=487.862s">And</a> so. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=490.865s">Giving</a> the mayor 4 years means less time campaigning more time spent working on what the city needs. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=499.642s">The</a> other thing to them with the mayor is a term limit of four terms, so no mayor will be able to serve longer than 16 years. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=510.106s">And</a> as far as the city council. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=513.067s">Ward</a> representation, which is something that people have talked about. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=517.069s">I</a> mean, I've lived in the city for 32 years, and for most of that time, people have been talking about why don't we have ward representation? <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=524.872s">We're</a> one of the only cities left in the state that does not have it. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=531.435s">So</a> that's a pretty big change, and it means our current council of seven at-large members would change to a hybrid <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=541.94s">Council</a> of 8 ward representatives 1 from each ward and 3 at large Councilors, which is also the standard size for. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=551.431s">Cities</a> like ours, our council is the smallest. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=555.738s">um</a> and that number because we wanted to have you don't have to be able to break a tie but also not just a single at large exactly right we did you remember because we did say well we could do nine but that would mean one at large and the point of hybrid is that you sort of have a mix of both so yeah yeah that's why um <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=579.467s">you</a> know, like Malden has eight wards and they have eight ward Councilors, three at large. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=584.749s">Somerville,</a> I believe only has seven wards, but they still, they have 11, they have four at large. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=589.911s">So</a> they're still doing 11, but if we had had six wards, you know, then maybe we would have gone with nine, but it makes sense to do the 11 because of the hybrid. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=605.137s">The</a> school committee, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=607.58s">will</a> have localized representation, not ward, because that would have made the school committee much bigger. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=613.268s">And,</a> you know, we didn't really see a need to increase the size of the school committee. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=618.335s">So,</a> um, they'll still be 7 members. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=621.72s">4</a> of them will be from <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=624.398s">districts,</a> so two wards will be combined to make a district, and then two at large and the mayor will remain on the school committee, but the school committee will elect its own chair, whereas currently our charter says the mayor is the chair. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=640.191s">Under</a> the new charter, the school committee will elect its own chair.

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=730.57s">I</a> think that's the main reason, yeah.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=737.963s">Um,</a> well, you know, the budget processes are, are outlined in state law. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=743.845s">So</a> there's certain things that, you know, we have to do because of state law says so, but one thing that is new and we, and we've also had some improvements to our budget process with the recent budget ordinance passed by the city council. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=757.849s">So,</a> um, so there's that also, but in the charter, there's a requirement that there's an annual budget meeting with the mayor and the school committee <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=768.712s">and</a> the city council sort of very early in the process. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=772.233s">I</a> think, I think the date was no later than February 15th. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=775.454s">So</a> that, that the intention of that is for these sort of three bodies to just communicate, um, and talk about the financial state of the city and the needs of the city and, and sort of get some, some of that think tanking, um, before the budget process begins.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=805.682s">Okay,</a> so we see the council school committee. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=809.005s">Um,</a> there are citizen participation mechanisms that we don't have in our charter now. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=816.174s">So.</a>  <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=818.296s">It</a> there's, um. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=820.132s">A</a> group petition, it was sometimes called a free petition where, and in the current proposed charter, it would be 100 signatures that. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=830.503s">To</a> put a measure to get the city council to put something on their agenda and talk about it. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=836.07s">you</a> just need to get 100 signatures. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=839.091s">Obviously,</a> then people can do that now, they can contact city councilors, and then the city councilors will often bring those issues to the floor. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=848.896s">This</a> provision is meant to, if a resident doesn't get that response, then they have this option to get 100 people to sign a petition and get the city council to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=865.013s">talk</a> about their concern. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=867.515s">It</a> doesn't require that they do anything specific, but it means it has to be taken to the floor. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=873.84s">There's</a> also provisions to put a measure on the ballot. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=877.963s">So</a> if there's something that we want to pass in the city or that some resident or group of residents wants to pass and they do the work of collecting the number of signatures required, it can get put on the ballot. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=892.334s">Also,</a>  <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=894.017s">If</a> the city council passes an ordinance and people say, you know, we don't agree with this and they get the required number of signatures, which is, you know, a lot, then they can put that on the ballot to, um, to say no to this referent to, to this, uh, measure. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=911.57s">Uh,</a> there's also a provision to recall the mayor. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=914.512s">So</a> again, pretty big lift to recall the mayor. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=918.114s">It</a> can't be done frivolously, but if for some reason there's some, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=924.267s">you</a> know, big corruption happening or something that motivated a large enough group of residents to collect the signatures and vote the mayor out, that that is possible. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=935.413s">Whereas</a> it wasn't, it's not possible in our current charter.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=966.397s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=967.178s">I</a> mean, that was definitely the hope.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=988.464s">Yeah,</a> so that was something that people brought up as a question. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=992.405s">And</a> when we talked to the call center about it, they basically said, you know, that doesn't generally happen, but there are provisions in state law if it doesn't. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=1000.576s">I</a> mean, there's the option of writing it. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=1002.518s">People</a> can write in a candidate. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=1005.08s">But</a> and then, you know, if that doesn't, yeah, usually that fixes it. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/charter-ballot-question/id1591707053?i=1000730372640?t=1011.705s">But</a> I mean, when we asked them about it, they I believe they said they didn't even know of a single case where that happened.

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=263.49s">Yeah,</a> sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=263.91s">I'll</a> take that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=264.931s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=265.551s">Um,</a> so, uh, we currently have an all at large council of 7 members. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=272.556s">And</a> the proposed charter would switch that to hybrid ward representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=278.68s">Since</a> the city has 8 wards, that means we would have 8 ward Councilors, 1 from each ward. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=284.176s">and</a> three at-large Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=287.299s">Hybrid</a> ward representation is standard practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=290.482s">We're</a> actually one of the only cities in the state not to have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=296.448s">And</a> our council is also the smallest council in the state for a city of our size. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=302.143s">So</a> that switch to hybrid ward representation will bring the size and composition of our council in line with other councils in the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=311.866s">Also,</a> we looked at a lot of things when we had this discussion, but some wards of the city have been significantly underrepresented in recent decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=321.809s">In</a> fact, two wards, wards one and four, have had no Councilors come from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=327.323s">And</a> what's interesting is that voter turnout actually often correlates with the most highly represented wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=335.267s">So</a> ward representation will ensure that every ward has a representative, and hopefully open the door to more people running for office, because running for office at large is very difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=349.535s">And</a> it's more manageable to really focus on a ward and focus on that number of people.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=483.124s">Well,</a> I think the current city council voted for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=486.086s">I</a> mean, all the ones that are running for re-election voted yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=489.908s">So</a> I take that as a support.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=516.989s">Yes,</a> so the actual form of government, which is a mayor council form is not changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=524.054s">So,</a> but there are a couple of things that will shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=526.836s">For</a> example, right now, the mayor has sole authority to appoint members of Medford's boards and commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=535.322s">The</a> boards and commissions that are mostly volunteer bodies, but they're really important for the vibrancy and the operation of many aspects of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=545.506s">The</a> city council will have a chance to be involved in that process, and that will make that process a little more collaborative. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=553.748s">That's</a> one thing.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=895.847s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=896.327s">So,</a> you know, the way the budget, city budgets are created and decided upon is really outlined in state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=906.074s">We</a> can't really determine that in the charter, but <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=909.488s">There</a> are some timelines that we can determine, and one of the things that we added that we hope will improve the budgeting process is that every year on or before February 15th, so right at the beginning or before the budgeting season gets going, the mayor will call a joint meeting of the city council and the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=934.581s">Before</a> the process gets going, <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=937.462s">Those</a> three bodies, our elected bodies, will get together to review the financial condition of the city and share relevant information. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=946.369s">So</a> this hopefully is going to create a more collaborative budget process that will better reflect the needs of all areas of the city.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1110.375s">Well,</a> we have a, we don't have, we have a whole section of the new charter, a whole article, article eight that's titled citizen participation mechanisms. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1119.497s">And</a> that's something that our current charter does not have. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1122.297s">Um,</a> so, uh, and there are different levels, um, of, of, um, actions that people can take under the, this proposed charter if it passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1134.219s">Um,</a> the first is, <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1138.02s">what's</a> called in the charter a group petition, where if you want to put something on the agenda for the council, you can get signatures to have it put on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1149.405s">Obviously,</a> probably the first thing that people would try is to contact their Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1155.707s">But</a> if that doesn't work, it might not always work, citizens will be able to get 100 signatures. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1165.411s">And</a> then the city council has to take up discussion of the measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1170.733s">Yeah,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1174.995s">Other</a> things that people would be able to do is if if they get together and get the signatures, they can put a measure on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1184.799s">For</a> residents to vote on, that's definitely a lot more signatures, but it's possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1195.603s">Yeah,</a> also overturning a measure passed by the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1200.705s">If</a> there's enough opposition to it and residents can get the required signatures, they can put on the ballot and ask the voters whether they want to reject that. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1213.549s">And</a> the last one is a recall of the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1217.504s">So</a> again, it's not something that can be done frivolously. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1221.525s">It</a> takes a good bit of work to get the signatures. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1227.126s">And</a> then it would also go on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1230.047s">But</a> it's something that residents will be able to try or have the option of doing, which we don't have now.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1293.741s">Yeah,</a> I would do you want to go 1st round or should I go?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1297.643s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1298.624s">So,</a> um, I, the 1 thing 1 thing I do just want to point out sort of. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1303.366s">Generally</a> speaking, our current charter is. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1307.468s">It's</a> two pages. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1311.111s">There's</a> many things that are not in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1314.934s">When</a> we first started our committee process, one of the memos that the Collins Center wrote up for us, and that's the Collins Center for Public Management. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1325.022s">They</a> help a lot of cities and towns with charter review, and we were really lucky to have them. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1330.286s">They</a> wrote up a memo on the complexity of Medford's charter that basically, because it doesn't cover things, you'd have to go through state law, figure out, oh, what do we do about this? <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1343.142s">And</a> so it's also makes it inaccessible for residents to understand how our government works. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1349.945s">So,</a> for example, there are no vacancy provisions in our current charter for mayor or school committee, and there's a 1 for city council, but it's not it's incomplete. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1362.961s">So,</a> when we had a school committee member step down a couple of years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1367.506s">there</a> was some confusion and it was figured out, but, um, there was a period where it was like, what do we, what do we do about this? <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1376.034s">Um,</a> if we had that situation with the mayor where a mayor had to step down or a mayor couldn't serve, I feel, you know, that could be a crisis for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1384.161s">What</a> do we do? <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1385.602s">Um,</a> so we have vacancy provisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1387.484s">That's</a> just an example of one of the ways in which our current charter is lacking.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1519.164s">Can</a> I add one more thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1520.265s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1521.662s">So,</a> I just wanted to add, you know, we've talked about ward representation and it makes sense that we're talking about it a lot because it's really been kind of the major issue even before we got this charter review going. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1533.965s">I've</a> been hearing it for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1536.186s">I</a> meet people who just moved here from other cities and they say, what's what's going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1540.167s">Medford</a> doesn't have wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1541.207s">That's</a> weird. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1543.927s">But</a> I do know also that there's some concerns about, well, what are we going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1550.589s">That's</a> four more people. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1551.689s">How</a> are we going to pay for that? <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1554.07s">I</a> just wanted to say that you can't put a price tag on better government. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1563.073s">We're</a> going to if we have more Councilors, we have more people to do work for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1567.915s">So</a> we'll also get that back. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1569.876s">We'll</a> get it back with a better system of government. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1572.577s">We'll</a> get it back with more people actually working for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1576.805s">And</a> as far as the salaries, the charter itself doesn't say what salaries are. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1583.13s">There's</a> nothing that says the salaries have to be the same or more or less. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1589.535s">So</a> these are all things that can be worked out. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1593.418s">They're</a> really like small potatoes in the big picture.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1859.163s">Yeah,</a> I just wanted to, you know, just Ron, you made me, you reminded me of something that there's been a little bit of confusion about in terms of <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1866.847s">the</a> city council because the charter says that the city council can hire staff subject to appropriation and they might get necessary expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1875.192s">But</a> the key phrase there is by appropriation and the reality is that it's exactly the same as the system we have now. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1882.676s">They</a> can't hire a staff member or get expenses unless it's appropriated in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1888.179s">That's</a> really not a change at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1891.001s">It's</a> just laid out there.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1901.153s">It's</a> really not changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1903.014s">They</a> do have the clerk, which is already an employee of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1908.875s">And</a> there is an assistant, which the city council has always had a city messenger. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1914.376s">So</a> they just changed the title of that, that's all. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1917.696s">So</a> it's really pretty much, it's exactly the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1921.137s">It's</a> just, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1923.053s">And</a> I also just want to say we have lawn signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1925.615s">If</a> you want to support the charter with a lawn sign, you can go to the website or email us at info at medfordcharternow.com. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1934.223s">And</a> to get those lawn signs, and we have literature, we'll be dropping all over the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1939.327s">If</a> you want to get involved in doing some lit drops, you can contact us. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGGRj9qmUY4&t=1944.031s">And</a> we have donation buttons on the website if you want to, you know, support us that way, because it all costs money.<h2><a href="../2025-08-28_og30Vvr2J5c/2025-08-28_og30Vvr2J5c.html">Medford City Council Candidate Forum 2025</a></h2>
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3160.944s">Thank</a> you to the Medford Democratic City Committee, the Library, my fellow candidates, and everyone for coming and tuning in. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3168.807s">I'm</a> Milva McDonald, and the story of why I'm running for City Council starts a long time ago, as a kid growing up with an immigrant working-class mom who came to America from Italy in the 1950s. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3181.813s">She</a> was the hardest worker I've ever known and she passed her work ethic on to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3186.518s">Whether</a> working at the Boston Globe while raising my four kids, sitting on the board of non-profits, or helping launch the Mystic LGBTQ plus youth support network, I have always put in the hard work required to get things done. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3200.17s">A</a> few years ago, I decided charter review needed to get done in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3204.715s">In</a> 2021, I convened a group of residents to pursue options, and in late 2022, at our request, Mayor Breanna Lungo-Koehn formed the Medford Charter Study Committee and appointed me as chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3218.568s">For</a> two years, I led our 11-member committee in a comprehensive review of our city's foundational document. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3225.432s">As</a> a result, for the first time in 40 years, a new charter is projected to be on your municipal ballot this November. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3234.396s">My</a> experience chairing the committee inspired me to run for office. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3238.799s">I</a> want to bring the same level of research, outreach, and deep listening to the work of being your city councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3247.485s">My</a> priorities include growing the city's tax base through zoning, reviewing fee structures, and fighting for a better pilot agreement with Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3256.287s">Addressing</a> the affordable housing crisis is a necessity. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3259.508s">We</a> must support the Affordable Housing Trust and the Community Land Trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3264.109s">To</a> ease the burden on taxpayers and renters, we should explore a residential exemption for owner-occupied homes and look further at the good landlord tax credit. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3274.211s">We</a> need to ensure that we are meeting the goals in the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan, which continues to safeguard Medford for the future while improving life now. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3285.279s">Medford</a> has great cultural organizations, but I believe the arts need an anchor at City Hall, so I support the installation of a City Arts Coordinator. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3295.567s">As</a> councillor, I would also work to create a commission to promote visibility, equality, and empowerment of our LGBTQ plus community. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3305.275s">I</a> think it's also the job of municipal officials to support our dedicated city staff and those in need, like seniors on fixed incomes and immigrant communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3314.983s">I</a> love people, hearing their concerns and stories, and doing my best to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3319.767s">As</a> a second-generation Italian-American with working-class roots, I will always put in the time, effort, and research needed to get the job done, and I will make responsiveness and respect priorities in all my interactions. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3335.18s">I'm</a> excited to get to work to make our beloved city an even better place to live, and I ask for your vote in September and November. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3343.768s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-08-25_XXXXXX00135/2025-08-25_XXXXXX00135.html">Milva McDonald (City Council)</a></h2>

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=271.677s">You</a> know, sort of been a person, always been a hard worker. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=278.663s">I</a> kind of got my work ethic from my mom, who is an Italian immigrant. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=283.467s">She</a> came to the United States in the 1950s at the age of 27. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=286.63s">And</a> it was kind of a culture shock for her, because the first time she had experienced running water, electricity, and heat. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=295.817s">So</a> being raised by her and my Italian heritage and my experience as the daughter of a working class immigrant contributes to sort of who I am today and who I've sort of become and my views on the importance of tolerance and listening and empathy and kindness. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=316.33s">I</a> also like to get things done. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=319.712s">And</a> a few years ago, I decided that I'd been hearing about charter review in Medford for too long. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=325.307s">And</a> that it was time to get it done. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=328.389s">So.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=328.769s">In</a> 2021, I sort of tried to rally people together, and we started this group, or we sort of continue to group. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=337.954s">I</a> mean, I was connecting with Jim Silva at that point. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=341.456s">He</a> had been very involved with charter review. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=344.323s">Um,</a> in previous iterations, or the attempts to get charter review to happen. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=349.604s">Um,</a> so we sort of revived the Medford charter review coalition, and we were pursuing different ways to get a charter review. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=357.246s">And</a> 1 of those was. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=358.947s">To</a> ask the mayor to form a committee, because what we learned was that most communities. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=365.168s">Review</a> their charters that way using. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=369.57s">a</a> special act, which is what Medford ended up doing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=373.032s">So</a> the mayor said, yes, I will form a committee. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=375.213s">And</a> I was honored to be appointed as a co-chair initially. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=379.675s">And</a> then Laurel Siegel, the other co-chair, left and I became the sole chair. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=385.998s">And</a> we went from about 2022 to 2024, which you know, because you were on the committee. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=391.561s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=394.291s">And</a> we, yeah, so we dove into all things charter. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=397.813s">So,</a> um, and I know we'll be talking probably about that more. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=402.255s">But</a> it was basically my experience on the committee learning about local government, listening and talking to residents. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=410.698s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=411.899s">All</a> of it just was, you know, it was inspirational and inspired me to stay involved with the city council run. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=419.643s">I'd</a> like to just sort of continue that work and bring that level of research and depth and listening to work on the city council.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=470.006s">Well,</a> in the charter is the sort of foundational document for the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=476.431s">And</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=478.49s">It</a> involves sort of how people are represented. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=481.613s">And</a> what sort of, because it's a structure of the government and so representation was 1 of the big things that we talked about and Medford being 1 of the only cities left in the state. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=498.167s">For</a> a long time, it's been one of the only cities that doesn't have board representation for particularly city council. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=506.071s">I</a> feel like that addresses some of what you just talked about. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=511.413s">Not</a> only because it allows people a more localized representative, it also creates more accessibility for running for office. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=525.798s">So,</a> you know, the, the hope is that when this charter passes, which I'm very much hoping that it doesn't November by 2027, we will have that new structure in place. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=538.767s">And</a> that could open doors for a lot, a lot more people to run for office that maybe couldn't do it or wouldn't have considered it before. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=547.673s">And</a> we heard some of that, you know, we heard that from some people in the listening sessions we did around the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=553.617s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=555.177s">You</a> know, some people said, oh, well, maybe if there was ward representation, I'd run for office.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=566.706s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=567.006s">And</a> covering, I mean, there's about 60,000 people in the city, and the wards are about 7,000 to 8,000 people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=579.281s">That's</a> a huge difference in terms of mailings, in terms of canvassing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=586.123s">I</a> mean, all that sort of work of campaigning, and it's a pretty big difference. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=593.364s">So</a> that's one thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=595.905s">Also,</a> the other thing, when we looked at Article 8, the citizen participation mechanisms, would hopefully give people more opportunity to be involved <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=608.897s">in</a> government respond to issues, um, maybe, um, have the opportunity to be able to get something on the ballot if they sort of tried to go through, um, the local government and they didn't and they couldn't do it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=624.648s">They</a> have a mechanism to use where they can make that happen. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=628.21s">Um,</a> so those things, I think also, um, I mean, if you're talking specifically about sort of equity and representation and things like that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=663.47s">So,</a> I mean, you know, there's definitely people talked a lot about. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=669.468s">how</a> long the council meetings are, and I know that the council is aware of that, and I know it's something that they're already thinking about. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=679.917s">But</a> that's one thing in terms of just operations. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=687.143s">There's</a> so many issues. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=690.125s">Zoning</a> is what people are talking about right now quite a lot, and that's definitely something that we need to change. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=699.006s">We</a> need to redo the zoning for because we need more housing we need and we need to increase our tax base. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=706.812s">So,</a> I think that is definitely a change that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=711.415s">I</a> think it's, I think it's going to happen so much work on it has already been done. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=715.478s">And</a> at this point, the good news is, I think that that people are really aware of it now more than they have been in the past. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=725.525s">So</a> it gives people an opportunity to. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=728.435s">uh,</a> offer really constructive, specific feedback and so that we can move forward with that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=734.238s">Um,</a> cause I think that's important. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=736.539s">Um,</a> there's also a lot of really important work to be done, um, like with, uh, uh, funding the affordable housing trust. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=744.504s">Um,</a> the board just recently released a really great action plan. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=748.286s">Um,</a> and part of that is a community land trust, which is also something that I really support. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=754.269s">And,</a> um, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=756.528s">hope</a> that that can evolve. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=758.97s">That's</a> where this community land trust sort of becomes a non-profit that holds land to benefit the public basically. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=768.235s">And</a> so it's affordable housing units that aren't going to go away. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=774.787s">I</a> think traffic calming is kind of something that I would like to see change. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=780.191s">Um,</a> and that's important, um, especially with the, um, you know, this eventual change in rezoning and things like that traffic is increasing anyway. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=791.278s">Um,</a> so I think, um, and I know that that's been worked on, like the street where I near where I live, they just put speed tables on and it's making a huge difference, but, um, bump outs, things like that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=805.484s">I</a> think we need to look at all those things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=808.745s">Um,</a> I think climate resiliency is really important and our city's done a really good job at that so far, but we need to just like, keep on that and make sure that the benchmarks in the climate action adaptation plan are being met. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=821.889s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=823.369s">But,</a> you know, some of them I'd like to even see increase, like, I'd like to see even more people use the curbside composting program. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=830.772s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=832.412s">The</a> community increase in the tree canopy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=835.898s">Um,</a> and and there's a lot of really great ideas. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=839.699s">I</a> loved some of the ideas I've heard from fellow candidates. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=842.92s">Like,</a> when I listened to Miranda on your show, she was talking about more benches and shelters at teas. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=849.542s">And</a> I just, yeah, I think that's great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=851.702s">I</a> love that idea. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=852.503s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=854.478s">Another</a> thing that I would really like to see happen is I'd like to see an arts coordinator at City Hall. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=862.801s">I've</a> talked to people in the arts community and we have so many great arts organizations in the city, but we don't have, we have the Arts Council, but there's not really a central kind of unifying anchor at City Hall. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=879.306s">And</a> I think that would, I think that could be really good for the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=885.174s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=885.574s">So</a> those are just some of the things.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=922.998s">I</a> mean, you know, 1 of the 1 of the reasons was because I, I entered the race on the way side. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=929.723s">So,</a> you know, that was a practical reason. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=934.007s">But</a> I also, I tend, I feel like I just tend to be sort of an independent minded person. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=939.911s">I</a> do happen to align with a lot of the. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=945.215s">Policy</a> ideas, but I also. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=948.999s">I,</a> you know, I, yeah, I just, I consider myself independent. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=953.931s">So,</a> I mean, it wasn't like... <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=956.971s">Like</a> I said, it wasn't so much of a tough decision because of the point at which I entered the race kind of made the decision for me anyway. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=964.677s">So,</a> yeah.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1000.556s">Well,</a> one of the other things that I would really like to work on, um, if elected is the creation of an LGBTQ plus commission for the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1010.923s">Um,</a> I know that the council's working to overhaul the human rights commission, and I think that's great, but, um, you know, other cities have LGBTQ plus commissions, um, in Arlington it's called the rainbow commission and I'm a little partial to that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1027.935s">And</a> I like that name, but, um, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1031.362s">I</a> think that that that would be an important step. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1036.686s">In</a> the city towards sort of promoting equality visibility for our LGBT plus community and empowerment. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1046.492s">And</a> I, I see that work as maybe separate from what. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1050.615s">You</a> know, or separate or enhancing and what might be done on the human rights commission. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1056.819s">So</a> I think. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1058.792s">You</a> know, there's different commissions in other cities. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1063.835s">They</a> do cool programming, obviously pride, but, you know, I think we don't have to limit things to just June. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1072.92s">I</a> think an LGBTQ plus commission would be a year round endeavor and. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1080.6s">whatever</a> the commission worked on, but the sort of, it would be focused around the mission statement, obviously, but they could look at policies, programs, advocacy, um, community conversations, community buildings, crosswalk painting. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1097.567s">I</a> mean, there's just so many, um, you know, so many options. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1100.688s">So</a> I, I would like to see that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1102.768s">I</a> think that would be, um, a pretty great thing for the city.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1125.599s">Yeah,</a> absolutely. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1127.888s">I</a> am having a couple of events with music, because I love music. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1134.455s">I</a> love to sing, but I love music, and I have musicians in my family. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1139.544s">make</a> sense for me to bring music into my campaign. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1142.306s">So</a> on, and they're both going to be at Mrs. Murphy's, which is an Irish pub on Salem Street. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1149.669s">It's</a> I believe 25 Salem Street. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1152.751s">On</a> August 29th, which is a Friday from six to eight, we're going to have Celtic music with Alistair White, who's a great fiddler and Eric McDonald on guitar. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1165.018s">Alistair</a> used to play in the Battlefield Band, which if anybody out there knows Celtic music knows that that's a pretty big name in Celtic music. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1173.026s">And</a> he's a, you know, he's a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1176.153s">Scottish</a> guy and he really knows the tradition. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1179.734s">So</a> that's going to be a really fun night of music and networking and etc. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1186.156s">And</a> on September 7th from 3 to 5 p.m. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1191.057s">we'll</a> have the Shereen Klezmer duo. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1193.498s">And</a> for people who aren't familiar with Klezmer music, it's really fun music. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1198.779s">It's</a> basically Eastern European Jewish folk music. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1202.541s">Um,</a> it's very, it's very fun. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1205.944s">So,</a> um, and both of those, uh, events, I will be there to meet people, talk to people about my platform, et cetera. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1213.75s">Um,</a> people will be able to order off the menu, um, and just have a great evening and afternoon and, uh, learn about the campaign. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1222.317s">So</a> those are the two events. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1225.299s">Um,</a> there's probably going to be other house parties too in the works, but those are the main things right now.

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=101.044s">Thank</a> you, and thanks for inviting me. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=103.105s">I'm</a> excited to be here.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=118.677s">Well,</a> I'm Milva McDonald, and I've lived in Medford for about 32 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=124.482s">I've</a> been in my current home in West Medford for about 25 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=130.407s">I</a> had several, three decades, I worked in journalism at the Boston Globe in the calendar section, if anybody remembers that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=140.555s">That</a> was a great section. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=141.476s">LS.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=141.596s">It</a> was. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=142.097s">It</a> was great. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=143.959s">I</a> also worked in the Globe West and Northwest and then eventually Boston.com. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=151.166s">Now</a> I work for a publicist, a very niche publicist. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=154.51s">We</a> promote exclusively jazz musicians. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=158.013s">I</a> also do some teaching and tutoring. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=161.477s">I</a> have some students. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=163.159s">I</a> homeschooled all four of my kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=165.343s">So,</a> and during that time, I co-founded a secular nonprofit called Advocates for Home Education in Massachusetts, which is still thriving. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=177.86s">And</a> I'm also a writer. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=179.021s">I've</a> written a couple of books about homeschooling. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=181.483s">I've</a> written short stories that I've had published in various journals. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=186.027s">I</a> also love music. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=187.529s">I</a> sing in three choruses, one called the Holla Lisa Singers. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=191.693s">And</a> the director of that chorus lives right here in Medford also. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=196.017s">And</a> I just sang in the Harvard Summer Chorus. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=198.079s">That</a> was great fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=199.48s">And</a> another chorus called Mutamonia. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=202.442s">I</a> also am a potter. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=204.363s">I</a> took up pottery a couple of years ago, and I absolutely love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=209.744s">So</a> you can see me at craft fairs around Medford this fall.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=214.086s">And</a> I also have a few things at the gift shop at Arts Collaborative Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=217.547s">Oh,</a> okay, that's wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=219.147s">That's</a> a great background. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=220.468s">A</a> lot of experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=221.988s">Yeah,</a> and I said I have four kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=223.609s">I</a> also have three grandkids.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=246.096s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=248.118s">Well,</a> giving back to the community has always been important to me and I've always been a hard worker. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=252.761s">I</a> kind of got my work ethic from my mom. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=256.544s">She</a> was an Italian immigrant who came to the United States in the 1950s. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=261.467s">at</a> the age of 27. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=262.087s">It</a> was quite the culture shock for her. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=266.909s">She</a> had really never been 10 miles out of her village until that point and now she's in this country experiencing running water, electricity, heat for the very first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=280.595s">So</a> my Italian heritage and my experience as the daughter of a working class immigrant sort of contribute to who I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=289.684s">And</a> my views on the importance of listening, tolerance, empathy, things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=297.172s">So</a> that's sort of a background. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=299.314s">But</a> I also really like to get things done. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=302.669s">And</a> a few years ago, I decided that I'd been hearing about charter review in the city for a very long time, and I thought, I really would like to see this get done. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=315.6s">So</a> in 2021, I kind of just rallied people and said, <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=320.965s">hey,</a> I'm going to invite everybody over, talk about charter review. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=324.969s">And</a> some people that had been involved in the past, like Jim Silva and a couple of other people, we got together, we sort of brought, we created a group called the Medford Charter Review Coalition. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=339.099s">And</a> we were pursuing different ways to get charter review done. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=342.803s">We</a> said we're just going to try everything and we were collecting signatures. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=347.288s">But</a> we also learned that one of the ways and which is actually the most common way for charter review to get done in Massachusetts is for a city committee to be appointed. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=360.303s">And</a> then that committee would do the work of the review and then it would go through the city government and then to the state house and back to the voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=369.315s">So</a> we approached the mayor and said, would you please form a committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=374.422s">And</a> she did. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=376.282s">And</a> to my honor, I was appointed chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=379.304s">Initially,</a> I was co-chair with Laurel Siegel, but then she left to work in the city's planning department. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=387.81s">And</a> we spent, we started in about, I think it was like November or December of 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=394.434s">We</a> finished up in late 2024, and I chaired the 11-member committee, and we dove into all things charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=402.339s">We</a> talked about <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=404.22s">Charters</a> from around the state, we prioritize public engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=409.163s">So</a> my experience chairing that committee, learning about local government and listening and talking to residents just really inspired me to stay involved with the city council run. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=419.51s">I'd</a> like to bring that same level of research and depth and listening to the city council.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=472.803s">It</a> was, you know, before the committee was formed, you know, I was focused on we got to get this charter review done and then it was really a big shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=484.115s">It</a> was like, oh, okay, we got the review because there was just so, it was so long in Medford just to get the review to happen before anybody could really start talking about, okay, now what, you know, what about the actual charter? <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=496.747s">So</a> it was a shift, but we did have help. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=500.913s">We</a> had the Collins Center for Public Management, which is a nonprofit out of UMass Boston that helps a lot of municipalities with this kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=510.525s">So</a> that was very important to have that help. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=516.131s">And,</a> you know, with their guidance we started looking at charters from around the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=522.033s">We</a> had a template, a modern charter template that the Collins Center provided for us so we could sort of see, you know, what are the elements that are in a modern charter, which of course our current charter very much lacks. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=539.579s">And</a> it was very important to us to do a lot of public engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=544.701s">So</a> we held three public information sessions at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=549.263s">We</a> created a survey that we distributed in five languages. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=554.145s">And</a> we held over a dozen listening sessions around the city, which were great. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=561.55s">We</a> worked with different organizations like Housing Medford, the Chamber of Commerce, Medford Family Network. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=568.534s">We</a> went to the West Medford Community Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=570.735s">We</a> just tried to cover as much ground as we could. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=574.643s">And</a> we sort of collected all this feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=578.725s">And</a> that was one of my favorite parts of the process was, you know, the listening sessions and talking to people and sort of listening to their thoughts and what they wanted to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=589.65s">And</a> once we had this gathered, we sort of dug in. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=594.452s">And</a> then we went through the charter article by article. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=598.614s">It's</a> a lot of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=599.835s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=600.795s">We</a> did create subcommittees. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=603.956s">So</a> that was pretty helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=606.797s">So</a> the subcommittee would like go in depth on a particular article and then bring it back to the whole committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=613.36s">The</a> Collins Center helped a lot with the drafting, but I think our committee was actually pretty ambitious and we did draft several of the sections on our own. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=624.344s">And</a> one of the important goals was getting it on the ballot this fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=630.186s">So</a> in order to make that, <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=632.167s">timeline</a> we were working really hard at the end.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=636.052s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=638.034s">And</a> then once we finished our final report, yeah, once we sort of hashed everything out, incorporated the feedback, we looked at studies and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=650.648s">Then</a> we put it all together in a final report, submitted it to the mayor, and then she reviewed it and sent it to the council, and then it did get to the statehouse. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=662.019s">And</a> it is projected to be on the ballot, which I'm very excited about.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=666.423s">That</a> was going to be my... Everything I hear is that it is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=670.327s">It</a> just had its... <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=673.73s">third</a> reading with the House. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=675.17s">It's</a> gone through the, it's almost through the Senate, so it should be at the Governor's desk very, very soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=680.771s">That's</a> what I hear.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=684.492s">And</a> I just want to, again, thank every member of the Charter Committee, because it was a lot of work, and people really donated their time, and we had a lot of fun, too.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=747.117s">Well,</a> they proposed an alternate scheme of district representation which would have resulted in a majority at large council. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=758.885s">I</a> knew that they would look at it and there was an expectation that there would be changes made. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=764.128s">That</a> particular change, I was a bit surprised at because we didn't really have indication from many of the council members that that would be their view. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=774.575s">Um,</a> and the other thing that I was mostly concerned because if there was one thing that we heard over and over again in our public engagement piece, um, it was ward representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=789.562s">please</a> give the city ward representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=791.503s">So</a> it was very clear that that was what people wanted. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=796.266s">And,</a> you know, knowing through the process, we learned about charter reviews in other cities and, you know, charter review isn't always guaranteed to succeed. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=805.852s">And</a> often charter review will hinge on kind of like one major issue for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=811.476s">For</a> instance, in Medford, there actually was a charter commission in 1978. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=817.605s">that</a> created a charter that got voted down. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=821.247s">And</a> the big issue then was mayor versus city manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=825.829s">And</a> that particular charter commission didn't recommend that and the voters said no thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=831.151s">And</a> then in 1986 the voters did get the switch to the plan A mayor and replacing the city manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=841.176s">So</a> to my mind the big issue that I heard from most people in the city, <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=847.033s">was</a> word representation and it didn't surprise me because before the committee even, it was something that I had been hearing about. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=854.024s">So,</a> you know, I felt like, <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=860.028s">Just</a> look, I tried to speak to the council about our findings. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=867.478s">Statistically,</a> we are one of the only cities in Massachusetts to not have ward representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=873.805s">Our</a> council is the smallest in the state for a city of our size. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=881.433s">It's</a> 9 or 11 is the standard size. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=884.355s">And</a> with the new charter we would have 11, 8 ward and 3 at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=889.357s">And</a> I was also, in my mind was also the ultimate goal of success at the ballot box. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=894.76s">And</a> I felt like that was an important piece for that to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=898.902s">I</a> think it resulted in a good public discussion where the merits and the challenges of ward representation were discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=907.326s">It</a> was good to see people coming out to share their views communicate with the council and the mayor and I was just very glad that in the end that the council reached a compromise with the mayor that kept ward representation for council and I just want to reiterate that what you were actually doing was This is what the people want
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=936.752s">I</a> mean, you know, and there was sort of, some people countered that with, well, we don't know what the people want. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=942.417s">There's</a> 60,000 people in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=944.018s">And</a> that is true, but we have to base it on what we were hearing from people.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=953.406s">And</a> that's what we did.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=957.169s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=989.935s">Yeah,</a> it was great. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=991.917s">I</a> mean, there were some, like some people say, well, you didn't listen to the people on everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=997.662s">For</a> instance, the mayor being on school committee, which became, I mean, that in the end, that was part of the compromise made between the mayor and the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1007.509s">And,</a> you know, what we did as a committee was we did take that public engagement very seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1013.111s">But</a> we also talked to, I mean, we talked to almost every sitting elected. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1019.394s">We</a> talked to prior electeds. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1021.075s">We</a> talked to prior mayors. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1022.675s">We</a> talked to city staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1026.096s">And</a> we looked at a lot of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1028.257s">And</a> the school committee subcommittee, which was chaired by Paulette Van der Kloot, looked very carefully <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1035.3s">chair,</a> mayor being the chair, and you know, there were various reasons that the committee decided to recommend that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1043.729s">It</a> was changed, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1046.913s">You</a> know, term limits was another one, because term limits are very popular, but when we dug into the data, <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1056.52s">It</a> just, it didn't make sense for various reasons to recommend it for council and school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1062.963s">We</a> did recommend it for mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1065.384s">But</a> I never heard the council complain about the fact that we didn't, well, there was one time actually, once they complained. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1074.529s">But,</a> you know, I mean, we did our best. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1078.39s">We</a> took the public engagement seriously, but we also had other information that we incorporated.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1097.969s">Well,</a> I hope everyone votes yes.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1104.695s">And</a> I just want to say one of the really important things in the new charter, if everybody votes yes and it gets voted through, is that we will have regular charter review. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1113.602s">So</a> we will not go for decades with our charter languishing again.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1138.474s">We</a> did our best.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1171.61s">So</a> my position is that the city does need a zoning overhaul. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1176.491s">There's</a> not really a question and I don't think there's disagreement about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1181.152s">I</a> think that there's been a lot of work done and we have these sort of visionary documents that have been guiding the process like the comprehensive plan and the housing production plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1193.895s">And</a> we've had 18 months with an outside consultant. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1196.456s">So</a> a lot has been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1199.076s">But</a> based on my conversation with residents and watching the community development board meetings, I think that slowing things down, especially with the residential zoning, was the right call. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1211.099s">The</a> good news is that people are learning about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1214.88s">They</a> know about it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1216.72s">For</a> whatever reason that didn't happen, I prefer to look forward and look at the sort of the upside of that, which is that now we actually are hearing from people. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1228.487s">And</a> they will have a chance to share specifics about their neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1233.169s">And</a> I think that's important because, you know, the consultants have done their best, but they don't know every neighborhood in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1239.773s">So,</a> now that we have residents aware and on board, they can share specifics about their neighborhood with the community development board and the council, and that can help guide the process to a good final outcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1256.533s">I</a> think that... <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1259.646s">That</a> kind of detailed attention is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1261.668s">We</a> also have to give that detailed attention to the squares and corridors. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1266.053s">I</a> know the Community Development Board is working really hard on everything that's been sent over to them, which is a lot.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1272.46s">Yeah,</a> it's a tremendous amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1277.685s">And</a> I think it's probably prudent <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1280.563s">to</a> take the time that it needs and look at details. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1284.605s">Like</a> right now, I know one of the things they talked about at their last meeting was the boundaries of the squares, for instance. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1290.787s">I</a> mean, that was a question that I asked a month or two ago, because I noticed that in my neighborhood, <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1299.546s">the</a> boundaries of the squares had been stretched so that some really beautiful old residential houses were potentially going to be zoned to mixed use. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1309.873s">And</a> so they're looking at those kinds of properties and those kinds of things and those details. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1316.638s">And</a> I think that that's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1319.479s">So</a> I'm glad that that's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1322.221s">One</a> of the things that residents that I've talked to have been concerned about, several, is <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1327.785s">Teardowns</a> in their neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1329.486s">Yes,</a> and we have already seen yes, you know a house in South Medford That's slated to be torn down That's a beautiful perfectly wonderful house. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1342.433s">So</a> and and people are worried about things like that so those those are some of the concerns I've heard and and <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1351.543s">What</a> I don't see disagreement on is I don't see disagreement on the need for new zoning and the need for new housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1358.932s">We</a> particularly need commercial zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1362.736s">So</a> I think that the good news is that I think most everybody in the city agrees that this is important.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1371.526s">And</a> that it needs to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1373.727s">I</a> don't think that anybody's trying to stop rezoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1378.111s">I</a> think it's just let's make sure that we're listening to people and figuring out what's really the best for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1388.538s">What</a> is the right zoning for Medford?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1473.772s">Yeah,</a> no, that's a that's an excellent question. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1476.233s">And</a> it's a very important question. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1478.874s">It's</a> also a tough question because we have limited options, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1482.415s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1483.536s">I</a> think what we were just talking about zoning, particularly in the commercial sectors, is is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1491.399s">I</a> mean, that's maybe one of the biggest things we can do is to make Medford business friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1501.182s">with</a> the zoning process, looking at permitting processes, incentives, things like that, so that we can grow our commercial tax base. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1510.167s">We</a> have a lot of potential for that, and it just needs to be realized. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1517.911s">State</a> aid and grants, identifying opportunities, I think the planning department works hard at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1524.695s">But</a> that's something that, you know, the council could conceivably work with them on, is identifying those kinds of opportunities and making them happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1539.525s">We</a> should be doing regular reviews of our fee schedules. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1544.028s">Like,</a> we just, parking fees were just looked at, and I know some people might not like that, but our parking fees are very low. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1552.894s">You</a> know, I personally will, you know, look and say, okay, well, will I get the same number of permits this year? <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1561.638s">You</a> know, I don't know if I will. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1563.759s">But</a> I might. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1564.96s">But,</a> I mean, everybody will have to weigh that decision, but things like, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1572.924s">Permitting</a> fees just every and also looking at our contracts like I mean even the shovel year, which is amazing It's also Been a great business opportunity and it's proven to be highly successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1588.348s">So</a> maybe renegotiating some of these contracts where we have now a proven track record and <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1595.309s">And</a> also, I know that this is something that's being looked at, but linkage fees, developer fees, so basically looking at fees, looking at opportunities for state grants, beefing up our commercial sectors, and renegotiating the pilot program with Tufts, looking at, you know, where we can, so those are some of the ways I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1620.738s">They're</a> all good ones.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1660.09s">I</a> am a proponent of affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1662.512s">Um,</a> and I, I think that it's great that this, that we have an affordable housing trust now. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1668.395s">Um,</a> then we need to figure out how to fund it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1670.976s">And</a> we have, uh, the affordable housing trust has a board that put out recently a great comprehensive report with ideas for that, including a community land trust, which I think would also be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1681.662s">That</a> would be, um, like sort of a city owned property that would be available to, <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1689.485s">Build</a> affordable housing on so and that would stay affordable, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1693.446s">No,</a> it'd be nice a city-owned. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1695.446s">Yeah,</a> I mean that's So I think that's those are important. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1699.367s">So</a> and and also in the affordability issue I think looking at a residential exemption for taxpayers for homeowners would be a good thing to investigate Other cities have that Malden has it.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1715.051s">And</a> that is basically where if you live in your property, then you are eligible to apply for an exemption to your tax bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1725.517s">I</a> think that climate resiliency is important, and we have a great climate action and adaptation plan, so I think keeping an eye on that and making sure we're meeting the benchmarks is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1736.503s">I</a> think a lot of great things have already happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1739.545s">Expanding</a> the tree canopy, and these things are great for climate resiliency, but they also improve people's quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1746.669s">So</a> the tree canopy is going to make a nicer city. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1750.251s">The</a> bike share program, I think, has been great for people. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1756.575s">And</a> I think safe streets are important, so infrastructure improvements, things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1765.042s">And</a> I also am a big supporter of the arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1770.367s">I</a> would like to, as a Councilor, advocate for the installation of a city arts coordinator. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1777.032s">One</a> of the things that I hear from people is we have so many great arts organizations, and we do.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1784.158s">I</a> agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1784.738s">Yeah,</a> we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1786.119s">But</a> part of sort of what happens is we don't, you know, the people are picking up the slack, kind of. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1793.082s">So</a> a city arts coordinator could be kind of a unifying, an anchor, basically. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1797.484s">Right,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1799.165s">And</a> support the arts council and sort of unify arts in the city So I and that's what I've heard from the arts community that that's something that they would like nice Um, and I also would like to advocate for an lgbtq plus commission Okay, which would be um, just a you know, one of another one of the city's volunteer commissions, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1820.286s">um</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1820.806s">to</a> sort of advocate for that community. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1823.388s">So</a> those are some of the things.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1847.249s">Okay,</a> I have a couple of really fun ones coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1849.97s">I</a> love music, I said that, and I have musicians in my family, and so there's a couple of events coming up at Mrs. Murphy's, which is the Irish pub on Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1862.353s">on</a> August 29th, which is a Friday, from 6 to 8. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1867.055s">We</a> will be there with Celtic music, a great fiddler named Alistair White, and guitarist Eric McDonald. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1875.998s">Alistair</a> is Scottish, and he used to be in the Battlefield Band, which if anybody knows Celtic music, that's a very big name. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1884.081s">So</a> that's going to be really fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1886.403s">We'll</a> be there from 6 to 8. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1888.364s">Come</a> on over. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1890.146s">Order</a> off the menu. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1891.967s">Chat</a> with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1893.208s">You</a> know, talk to me about my platform. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1895.63s">Get</a> to know me. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1896.21s">I</a> would love to see you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1898.131s">There's</a> another one at Mrs. Murphy's on September 7th, which is a Sunday from 3 to 5 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1903.735s">with</a> the Shereem Klezmer duo. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1906.618s">And</a> Klezmer music is Eastern European Jewish folk music, and it's really fun.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1913.062s">That</a> will be a clarinet player and an accordion player, both who live in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1917.907s">Yeah,</a> so I'm excited about those. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1919.228s">Very</a> nice, very nice.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1960.493s">Yeah,</a> that's hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1961.534s">Thinking</a> of the least favorite thing is hard, because I'm like, oh, there's nothing I really don't like to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1965.196s">But</a> then I thought, oh, OK, driving. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1967.737s">That's</a> probably my least favorite, because the traffic, so many people use Medford as a cut through, which is something I would like to sit down and think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1978.843s">Is</a> there some way to discourage that? <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1983.025s">But</a> anyway, so I would say that's probably my least favorite, driving. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1987.748s">My</a> most favorite? <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1989.829s">That's</a> much easier, although hard to pick one. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1992.571s">So</a> I probably picked a few. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1994.092s">You</a> could pick a few, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1996.634s">The</a> library is one of my favorite things, go to the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=2000.437s">Our</a> second poet laureate Vijaya Sundaram runs a poetry club there and I love going to her poetry club. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=2008.023s">She</a> also runs a poetry open mic at the Arts Collaborative Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=2013.727s">So</a> I love those things and I love the Arts Collaborative Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=2017.01s">I</a> also love the farmer's market. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=2020.049s">And</a> the other thing I love to do in Medford is my husband and I have a tandem bike, which is like a bicycle built for two. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=2027.471s">So</a> we like to ride that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=2029.071s">Yeah,</a> we ride it over to the Mystic Lakes and look for the eagles and the herons. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=2036.633s">And</a> yeah, so that's definitely one of my favorite things.

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6321.44s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6322.141s">Mildred</a> McDonald, 61 Monument Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6324.224s">I</a> just have three quick questions and I'll be brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6327.108s">One</a> is about the interactive map. <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6329.23s">Thank</a> you for making it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6330.272s">It's</a> really awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6332.354s">My</a> question about it is... <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6335.621s">dived</a> in too heavily, but the nuances that were referred to earlier, will those be, will those show in the interactive map? <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6343.385s">If</a> you're looking at the interactive map at a particular property, will you be able to tell some of the nuances that were mentioned earlier about, or will you just see, oh, they can go seven stories, but the nuances that might prevent that, will those show in the interactive map? <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6359.593s">That's</a> one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6360.833s">My</a> other question is for the squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6365.473s">Does</a> this process at all look at some of the traffic issues or particular hairy intersections? <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6370.816s">I'm</a> thinking in particular of the Route 60 and Playstead and Harvard Ave where the commuter rail crosses, where the train crosses, and it's pretty precarious right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6381.681s">So</a> I think there's some concern of residents that increased density could create safety issues and difficulties. <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6389.265s">And</a> so how does this process incorporate that? <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6392.407s">And</a> I know you don't know what's going to happen exactly as a result of the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6396.07s">So</a> I know that's part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6397.271s">But</a> just wondering where along the line, maybe does that come in? <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6400.953s">And</a> my third question is a little unrelated to the squares, but since private ways have come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6408.078s">I</a> could be wrong about this, but my understanding is that there's a process to change private ways to public ways, and that could potentially be initiated by the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6417.425s">And</a> since we have so many, and based on the map I looked at, sometimes they cover a whole neighborhood, like Lawrence Estates, for instance. <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6424.971s">Has</a> the City Council ever considered trying to make some of those roads that really do function as public ways, public ways? <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6432.636s">So</a> those are my questions.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6748.906s">Yeah,</a> like what Zach earlier was saying how, you know, if you look and see, oh, nine stories can go up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6756.717s">with</a> the incentive and you live near it and you're freaked out about that, it might not necessarily be true because there's other factors that would prevent that from going up.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6856.016s">No,</a> I think the map is awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6857.297s">Thank</a> you so much.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6927.113s">So</a> basically the map is great and it gives you good general information, but don't make assumptions about individual parcels based on the general information.<h2><a href="../2025-04-15_j2zlMvp6B6U/2025-04-15_j2zlMvp6B6U.html">Special Meeting of the Medford City Council 04-15-25</a></h2>

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6903.248s">Milva</a> McDonald, 61 Monument Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6905.451s">I'm</a> going to try to talk fast. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6907.674s">There</a> was a lot of things said about the committee, so I just want to address a few of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6911.499s">I</a> may have misunderstood, but I thought I heard someone say that the Charter Study Committee left information out of the survey that we didn't want <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6921.952s">to</a> include. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6923.013s">So</a> if I misunderstood that, I would like, please correct me. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6926.994s">But</a> I would just want to say, if you have that impression, please come and talk to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6932.537s">Because</a> as far as I know, it is absolutely not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6936.258s">I</a> also just wanted to say, and this has been said before, district representation was not asked about because it does not happen in Massachusetts on city councils. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6946.563s">And</a> there have been references by Councilors to communities that have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6949.924s">And</a> I would love to hear the names of them other than Boston and Worcester. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6954.225s">Boston</a> is essentially not comparable. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6957.106s">State</a> law even separates it out from other municipalities. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6962.207s">And</a> Worcester is the second largest city in the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6964.748s">So</a> I am truly interested in hearing about the other communities that have it on city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6971.01s">Ward</a> representation has a definition that is understood. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6975.831s">People</a> know what it means. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6977.632s">So</a> when all of you ran on it, that's what they understood. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6981.115s">When</a> all of you have said for five years, 100% in favor of ward representation, when you said to us in interviews that you were in favor of ward representation, everybody knew what you meant. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6995.867s">So</a> the reason it wasn't asked was because it wasn't on our radar, because it's not really done. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7000.93s">When</a> the school committee subcommittee started digging in, they found that it is, there are a few school committees that have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7008.594s">And</a> I won't go into the, I've said it before, it's in the final report, why it was considered to school committee, but not city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7017.34s">I</a> also wanna say, this is not like the Senate. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7021.142s">The</a> problem with the Senate of our country is that you have senators who represent very small numbers of people and others who represent massive numbers of people who have the same power. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7036.027s">each</a> ward representative would represent the same number of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7040.99s">So</a> you may have a problem with the fact that some wards have low voter turnout and ward three that has high voter turnout has had a disproportionate number of representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7052.117s">And</a> I personally don't think that's an accident, but please don't say it's like the Senate because it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7060.807s">The</a> demographic research that has been done is great, but the demographics will change. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7067.072s">And</a> this charter is going to be in place for, if it passes, for at least 12 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7072.577s">If</a> you're confident that the demographics are going to be exactly the same and the district method will serve, will fix whatever you think ward representation won't, <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7083.386s">That</a> makes sense, but I don't think, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7086.909s">I</a> don't think any of us think that demographics are gonna stay the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7089.991s">The</a> housing studies that have been mentioned, we also addressed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7094.654s">If</a> there are more, I want to see them. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7096.916s">Please</a> show them to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7098.497s">There's</a> one study that we were able to find. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7101.139s">I've</a> asked repeatedly, several people, no one has been able to produce anything but that one study, which is not very conclusive. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7109.745s">So,</a> and just one more thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7113.399s">It</a> has been said, no system is perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7117.14s">This</a> isn't a moral issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7118.921s">This</a> isn't something, there's no perfect system. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7123.483s">So</a> a district system is not gonna be perfect either, but you're willing to ignore your constituents because on the idea that this is some moral issue, that it's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7139.407s">And</a> I don't understand that, because charter review is not easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7144.109s">There</a> are a lot more stops that this charter has to go to after you. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7148.872s">The</a> last one is the voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7152.534s">And</a> people have talked about word representation in the city for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7156.816s">It</a> was the biggest issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7158.657s">When</a> we talked to people, that is what they talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7163.019s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7165.59s">I</a> don't understand why you would abandon that when you have all supported it in the past and your constituents are asking you for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7174.914s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=10633.604s">That's</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=10634.525s">And</a> it looks to me like Amesbury is the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=10636.687s">So</a> the only two that I could find outside of Worcester and Boston were those two, and also Worcester is also a home rule charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=10644.713s">So</a> those are all home rule charters. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=10646.194s">So</a> we really don't know if the state has seen a charter that does this for city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=10654.421s">I</a> just wanted to make that point.

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15005.037s">When</a> the committee discussed Milton McDonald 61 Monument Street, when we discussed referendum, when we were discussing the timelines, we did see them as initiative and referendum as inherently different. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15016.323s">And</a> one of the things that we discussed was that a referendum pauses a measure that was passed by a duly elected body and that it didn't <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15025.901s">that</a> that time frame, we didn't want it to be extended any more than it had to. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15031.464s">So</a> we wanted to give the citizens the right to do it while also making sure that the elected body that passed it wasn't, that the measure wasn't put, held at bay for too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15047.072s">I</a> just wanted to point that out.

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9843.576s">You</a> mean the process of creating the survey?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9854.054s">The</a> feedback we got was that we wanted the survey to be accessible, so not too complicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9862.42s">We</a> asked about major questions that voters are most concerned about, which is the composition, term limits, things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9873.408s">The</a> results are all in the final report. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9875.589s">So,</a> I mean, I can get them, but you all have them, right?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9895.175s">Whether,</a> for council, you're talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9898.115s">Yes,</a> for city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9901.516s">Whether</a> to remain all at large? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9906.81s">to</a> be ward-based, hybrid-based. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9910.654s">I</a> mean, we can't be all ward-based, because we only have eight exclusively ward-based, because we only have eight wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9917.161s">So</a> that's not really an option on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9919.604s">Anyway.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9928.153s">The</a> combining of the wards? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9929.809s">Oh</a> yeah, combining of words or... No, that was something that came up in the discussions about the school committee to address the challenges of making school committee, applying word representation to the school committee, because that would have increased the body size. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9947.567s">I</a> see. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9948.468s">And</a> so that's how that came up.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9991.111s">Well,</a> it's. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9992.854s">very</a> common cities all over the state have a different composition for city council and school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9999.518s">So</a> I think voters can figure it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10003.74s">I</a> mean, they do in most other cities or many other cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10009.624s">You</a> know, I think this is laid out in the final report, but I don't think we saw a call to increase the size of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10019.075s">But</a> we also recognize that the community still wanted board representation for the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10027.858s">I</a> actually was not on the school committee subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10031.68s">And</a> I think when you have that discussion, maybe Paulette Van der Kloot would participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10036.762s">She</a> chaired that subcommittee and they had extensive discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10039.883s">So</a> I would actually prefer to let her speak more about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10042.544s">I</a> can tell you in general, because obviously they came back to the full committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10046.979s">And</a> we then discussed it, so I can tell you more in general, but if you want more specifics of how they reached that, she did give you a more detailed answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10057.829s">But</a> that was the gist of it, was trying to incorporate ward representation without necessarily increasing it to a body of 11, which we felt was appropriate for council, but not for school committee.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10232.927s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10235.667s">they</a> don't collect that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10239.089s">I</a> do just want to say that the discussion about competitiveness, we didn't look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10246.434s">That's</a> not, but what we did look at was representation of the wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10251.778s">And</a> we looked back to 2005 and found that two wards in the city had no Councilor from those wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10262.528s">So</a> they had zero representation and that two wards that those were words one and four and two words two and three had disproportionate representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10270.996s">And</a> in terms of the competitiveness, you know, like I said, we didn't look at that we didn't research it, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10279.364s">I</a> can say anecdotally that in my approximately 30 years living in Medford, I've never seen an incumbent city councilor lose an election, and I wouldn't call that competitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10290.329s">So</a> I just wanted to say that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10318.583s">Yes,</a> we did some of those, and they should be in the final report. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10322.726s">Some</a> of the graphics didn't transition well, and so there's actually a new version on the website, I think, with better graphics that you can check. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10330.631s">But</a> Jean Zotter worked on that a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10333.894s">So</a> if you wanted more details on that, you could speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10337.716s">I</a> don't know if she's on Zoom, but she collected a lot of that information and presented it.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10445.612s">Jean,</a> if you don't mind, if I could just add that one of the reasons, as she mentioned, not everybody gave demographic information, but one of the reasons we chose to collect it was so that we could try to do outreach to populations that we didn't get as many responses from. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10461.538s">And</a> Jean was an amazing organizer of listening sessions around the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10467.7s">And</a> we tried to go and we, I mean, it's all in the final report. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10471.902s">So</a> you can sort of see, but I just wanted to add that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10583.456s">We</a> wanted the charter to succeed with the voters and at the state house. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10590.397s">So</a> we didn't necessarily look at alternatives that aren't used. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10596.339s">Ranked</a> choice voting did come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10601.3s">That</a> is something that we believed would see a hurdle at the state house, especially because Medford during the state question <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10613.69s">voted</a> for ranked choice voting only with a small majority. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10617.014s">So</a> I think, you know, the success of the charter, the ultimate success of the charter was a consideration for us.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10666.193s">Could</a> you just repeat? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10667.053s">I'm</a> not sure I cut that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10690.401s">Yes,</a> we had a spreadsheet of cities in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10695.064s">We</a> didn't look at other states. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10697.306s">We</a> don't know what the interaction of municipal governments with state government is in those states. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10703.89s">There's</a> just so many other factors that could come into play. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10706.571s">So</a> we stuck to Massachusetts.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10765.07s">I</a> believe not. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10768.127s">You</a> know, I don't have it in front of me, so I can't say 100%, but I don't think we did.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10776.891s">To</a> be honest, I mean, just there is a graph in the final report that represents the number of Councilors who ran from each ward and then who won. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10789.596s">So</a> there is information about that in the final report.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10823.713s">I</a> don't think that would be my decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10825.935s">So,</a> I mean, I think that would have to be between you and the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10831.199s">I</a> don't, I mean, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10836.963s">We've</a> officially finished our work, so I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10842.585s">I</a> just don't feel like I can answer that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10851.629s">Possibly.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10883.543s">Well,</a> are you referring to multi—I mean, the— <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10891.068s">Sorry,</a> it's getting late. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10892.349s">The</a> options you talked about before.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10897.353s">So</a> what are you talking about exactly?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10903.757s">Just</a> simply district versus.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10908.14s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10937.329s">But</a> we explained why.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10952.053s">I</a> mean, we wouldn't be the only city that has this configuration with a different configuration for school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10958.695s">Lowell,</a> for instance, has an exact, you know, they have eight wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10963.296s">They</a> have 11 ward Councilors, one from each ward, three at large, and then their school committee is broke down with districts at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10972.482s">And</a> they have a seven-member school committee as well.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10978.846s">I'm</a> just saying it's not unheard of.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11018.226s">I</a> mean, there are timelines also. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11021.328s">So</a> that's something to consider as well.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11207.294s">I'm</a> sorry, of what?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11238.116s">It's</a> the census data.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11275.665s">I</a> feel like that's a question for the Pollen Center, because they have more knowledge about that in general.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11570.842s">We</a> did look at that and we asked, we looked for the research and we asked the Collins Center and we only found <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11577.98s">one</a> study. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11580.121s">If</a> there are more, we didn't find them and we couldn't, the Collins Center didn't know of any either. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11585.905s">And</a> we also mentioned that in the final report that that was the finding that you quoted, but there were also caveats, which included that it was a, it was mostly looked at towns and that more study would be warranted for the kind of <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11608.206s">area,</a> areas like Medford cities, and also that he didn't, the author didn't consider potential benefits of ward representation, including increased diversity. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11620.874s">So</a> it just didn't, it was one study, looked at one thing, and it wasn't a really broad, there wasn't much broad agreement on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11632.443s">and</a> the issues of representation and the potentiality for increased diversity, more accessibility to running for office were just more compelling to us.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14566.52s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14567.061s">Melvin</a> McDonald, 61 Monument Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14570.484s">I</a> want to thank Anthony for speaking and sharing his thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14574.987s">I</a> do just want to say that we all on the committee have different perceptions and different experiences, but we did consider other numbers besides 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14587.317s">I</a> could bore you with the details of that, but I don't feel like I have to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14592.281s">I</a> think it shows up in the minutes of our meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14595.806s">We</a> did not simply only consider 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14602.315s">Other</a> than that, I think we did take a comprehensive look and I think our final report shows that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14608.278s">So</a> I feel like it speaks for itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14612.761s">The</a> one thing that I did wanna point out because there's been talk about voter turnout and numbers were given about voter turnout in particular wards and the wards with low voter turnout correlate directly with the underrepresented wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14628.53s">When</a> candidates run for office, they naturally go where the voters are, so it becomes a, a cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14639.601s">And</a> one of the hopes is that with representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14643.965s">voter</a> turnout could increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14647.587s">So</a> I just wanted to point that out, that the low voter turnout correlates with the underrepresented or zero represented in the last couple of decades' wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14658.973s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-10-04_MCM00001563/2024-10-04_MCM00001563.html">Medford Charter Study Committee 10-03-24</a></h2>

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=15.558s">I</a> think she just came in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=16.719s">I</a> think she's just come in.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=23.302s">That's</a> Phyllis, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=25.863s">Phyllis</a> Fong? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=26.383s">I</a> think that's Phyllis. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=29.426s">All</a> right, so the first order of business is the minutes from our last meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=34.83s">Did</a> everyone have a chance to look at them? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=38.013s">Are</a> we good? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=38.533s">Do</a> we need any changes? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=42.356s">Second?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=46.58s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=48.181s">All</a> in favor? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=48.782s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=52.024s">Any</a> opposed? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=53.706s">All</a> right, so I will get those minutes posted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=58.629s">Frances,</a> thanks for the message. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=61.131s">We'll</a> keep an eye on the chat in case you have any comments. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=67.255s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=68.396s">Thank</a> you for the congratulations. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=70.197s">So</a> this is scheduled to be our final meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=74.601s">I</a> want to thank everybody. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=76.903s">It's</a> been long, but it's been really positive and productive, and I really can't thank you all enough. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=87.66s">I</a> also want to thank the Collins Center, who is with us tonight, Anthony Wilson, and I believe Marilyn is also here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=94.722s">So</a> the work we have to do tonight is we just have to vote on the final draft of the <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=103.838s">charter</a> and the final report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=105.919s">So</a> I guess the first thing I want to say, let's do the charter document first. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=111.422s">And</a> I just want to make an announcement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=114.824s">There</a> was like a little clerical issue and section 919, because we had discussed putting the compensation committee in the charter, but then we voted to just recommend it as an ordinance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=129.911s">just</a> based on some of the discussions, it ended up in the draft charter, so that's being removed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=135.016s">Just</a> in case anybody noticed that, I'm just letting everybody know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=140.841s">Section</a> 919 will be removed as we voted and it was mentioned in the final report as a recommendation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=151.491s">Now,</a> I'll open the floor to see if anybody has any <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=154.956s">to</a> bring up about the charter document. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=158.439s">And</a> then we'll do the final report after that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=180.428s">Okay,</a> that's great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=182.809s">I</a> just want to hear what Eunice's comment was and then we'll do that motion.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=303.076s">So,</a> Anthony or Marilyn, can you answer that?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=385.691s">Well,</a> I guess I think, Eunice, your question is, under this provision, if the mayor dismisses a city officer or department head, do they stay in the job for 30 days?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=404.223s">So,</a> Anthony and Marilyn, does this mean that the person has to stay or gets to stay on the job for another month?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=455.914s">Ron,</a> did you have a comment about this?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=494.616s">And</a> this applies to a city officer or head of a city department appointed by the mayor, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=501.641s">So</a> I don't think it applies to anybody else.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=516.03s">Maury?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=637.446s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=639.688s">Anthony</a> Wilson, did you have something to add?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=695.243s">That</a> sounds like what we discussed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=700.771s">So,</a> Eunice, do you feel like your question has been answered or is there anything? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=706.559s">I</a> think I get it now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=707.82s">So,</a> thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=709.943s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=711.045s">Ron?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=796.983s">Okay,</a> Phyllis has a question, but I'm... Ron, if I hear your question correctly... I have a question for Ron.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=815.413s">I</a> mean, it has to go through the Mayor, the City Council and the State House first, but providing when it gets to the ballot, that's your question.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=826.398s">Will</a> people be able to vote on... I was in and out, so thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=830.719s">Okay,</a> so Anthony or Marilyn, when these questions get on the ballot, what's usually the structure?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=993.456s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=995.296s">Ron,</a> does that answer your question?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1090.461s">Thanks,</a> Ron. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1093.339s">I</a> think, I mean, I don't know if Anthony or Marilyn wants to speak to this, but I'm not sure that we have the, that's in our power. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1101.343s">I</a> mean, you know, our task was to review the charter and create a report and that's what we've done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1107.406s">But</a> Anthony or Marilyn, is there any way we can look at some of what Ron is talking about?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1201.817s">We</a> have to get back to Maury's motion and officially adopt a vote on this.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1345.123s">All</a> right, thanks, Maury.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1410.319s">So</a> what I sent out about a week ago was the final report, which so when we submit, we will submit the draft charter will be part of that final report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1423.671s">So</a> whatever was in the final report currently is what we would submit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1428.355s">So</a> if you had something that you thought we should add, I mean, did you have a chance to look at it?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1482.783s">Jean,</a> did you want to say something about this?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1499.542s">I</a> think maybe, Anthony, are you talking about certain things that our committee voted to include that the Collins Center said, well, this isn't in like, for instance, the ethics commission and the financial reporting or the school committee clerk. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1514.633s">If</a> you're talking about things like that, I guess I would ask Anthony or Marilyn, when committees write their final reports, is that the kind of information that they generally include?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1567.384s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1567.865s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1568.245s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1570.326s">Um,</a> okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1571.728s">So</a> Anthony, do you, do you have anything else you want to say?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1595.338s">So</a> that would be, so what I would like to do is yes, the answer to that is yes for the charter, the draft charter portion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1604.585s">And</a> then once we get that done, we'll look at the final report part and see if anybody has anything that they feel should be changed or added to that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1614.154s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1615.074s">So</a> Maury and Eunice, did you have anything to say before we go ahead with that vote?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1841.731s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1843.692s">All</a> right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1844.133s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1844.813s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1845.274s">Now</a> we are going to go ahead with. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1848.196s">Well,</a> his motion, which anybody want to officially 2nd that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1853.182s">that</a> we're gonna vote on the charter document. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1857.364s">I</a> second. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1858.665s">Okay,</a> so the question is, do we accept this draft charter as written to be put into our final report? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1872.533s">Okay,</a> Eunice.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1877.155s">Ron.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1879.117s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1881.038s">Phyllis.</a>

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1928.575s">Well,</a> first, I just want to ask if anybody has any changes or additions they want to make. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1933.237s">Who's</a> that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1934.798s">Eunice.</a>

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2194.457s">We</a> associate a total. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2197.299s">So,</a> I guess we did. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2198.359s">So,</a> when you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2201.962s">Yeah,</a> you're suggesting including, even though those were just our meetings, they were all open to the public. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2206.949s">So</a> you're suggesting adding these to the public engagement section, making the point that this was part of the public outreach of the committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2216.703s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2217.083s">I</a> mean, the fact that all our meetings were open to the public and we have the public attending.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2259.844s">Okay,</a> so you want to basically. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2264.526s">suggest</a> that we add this to the charter? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2268.727s">Does</a> anybody have any thoughts about this? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2270.347s">Does</a> anybody have any? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2271.368s">I</a> make a motion to do so. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2273.088s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2273.868s">Does</a> anybody want to have any?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2331.584s">Okay,</a> I didn't see who raised their hand first, so I'm just gonna go to the first person on my screen, Ron.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2349.718s">Okay,</a> go ahead, Ron.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2527.85s">Just</a> for a minute, Anthony, go ahead.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2589.748s">Okay,</a> thanks for that, Anthony. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2591.729s">Danielle,</a> I think Maury was next, and then Danielle.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2617.927s">Yeah,</a> let's just focus on the proposal.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2667.545s">OK,</a> thanks, Maury.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2670.369s">I</a> just want to let Danielle make her comment.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2729.987s">That's</a> a, that's a good point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2731.791s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2732.352s">I</a> do want to vote on it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2735.136s">But</a> can I put my editor hat on for a minute, Eunice? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2738.057s">Are</a> you okay with that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2739.537s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2739.917s">I</a> mean, this was a draft. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2741.718s">I</a> mean, you can, you know, tweak it as needed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2744.959s">I'm</a> just in the streamlined mindset, and I would like to go from various components of a charter to we held 30 subcommittee meetings, just because that other information is in other parts of the <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2761.643s">Well,</a> the Collins Center is in other parts of the final report, and I don't necessarily think we need to say that they were the first Thursday of the month. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2770.652s">That's</a> just, and then it just tightens it up.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2777.679s">So,</a> well, Jean just did it, so. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2781.422s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2795.501s">It</a> just tightens it up a little bit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2797.483s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2798.003s">Yeah,</a> I'm good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2799.384s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2800.085s">So</a> we're going to vote on whether to add this to this community engagement section of the final report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2808.852s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2812.002s">Eunice?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2812.902s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2815.703s">Well,</a> this is where I can't see everybody, so I'm going to try to remember everybody's name. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2819.805s">Phyllis?</a>

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3057.212s">Yeah,</a> did that not get in there? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3058.832s">I</a> don't think so.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3083.017s">I</a> agree with that, but just because the superintendent is yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3089.29s">Current</a> and former superintendents? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3091.852s">I</a> think Belson was interviewed too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3093.794s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3094.915s">The</a> school committee subcommittee did that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3097.538s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3097.798s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3101.982s">If</a> they were included in the sixth, we should change that number, right?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3113.31s">Jean,</a> when you wrote this section, did you include them in the six? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3116.413s">I</a> don't remember, so I'll double check. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3118.475s">Okay,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3134.463s">Yes,</a> Adam Hurtubise, Alicia Hunt, also Nina Nazarian.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3142.006s">Yeah,</a> we sort of interviewed her. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3144.087s">We</a> had an email exchange.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3156.685s">Oh,</a> yeah, that's right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3157.726s">Is</a> that the right spelling? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3160.81s">Yes,</a> that's right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3164.234s">Thank</a> you, Eunice, for paying attention to this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3172.646s">I</a> don't know how you spell that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3174.547s">You'll</a> check that later, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3176.067s">I'll</a> check it, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3177.568s">I</a> think it's H-U-R-T-I-B-U. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3181.229s">You're</a> his neighbor, don't you? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3182.99s">I</a> know, he is my neighbor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3184.01s">Yeah,</a> but that's okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3185.691s">We</a> can double check that later. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3187.252s">We'll</a> make sure that's right.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3196.955s">We</a> didn't know that, but that's a good, I think that would be a worthwhile addition.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3253.613s">Proposed</a> charter or something, so you're talking about under the sort of major recommendation sections. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3259.936s">Yeah,</a> I mean, we have articles.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3270.161s">Well,</a> I mean, the reason they're not there is because we didn't, there weren't, you know, that section just sort of pulls out the major recommendations that we're making in the charter, but in those sections are, didn't have any really sort of recommendations of note. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3284.65s">That's</a> why we didn't do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3286.852s">But</a> the major recommendation is to add that section. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3290.955s">To</a> have a new modernized charter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3292.576s">Yeah,</a> that's in that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3296.788s">Yeah,</a> I'm just trying to think of how we would do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3306.561s">So</a> Eunice, can you just explain where are you suggesting we?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3323.953s">You</a> know, so we would say you skipped over article 1, so we would say article 1 incorporation short title definitions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3333.523s">And</a> just leave it blank. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3335.86s">after</a> that?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3376.401s">What</a> do people think about that idea?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3406.373s">Okay,</a> Maury, do you have?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3414.177s">Well,</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3416.19s">You</a> mean, well, we did, we were the final report subcommittee put this together.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3425.555s">Well,</a> I know, but Eunice wasn't on that committee, so.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3442.925s">Well,</a> I think what we have here is we just pulled out, highlighted some of our main major recommendations in the final report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3452.452s">And</a> there's this thought that since we didn't pull out articles, we didn't mention articles 1, 5, or 10, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3460.838s">Do</a> we do 9? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3461.698s">We</a> might not have 9 in there either.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3469.853s">No,</a> we have nine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3470.574s">Okay,</a> good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3472.494s">So</a> 1, 5, and 10, do we add them here just to sort of illustrate that they exist in this body, in this part of the final report to illustrate that they exist and indicate what they are? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3486.217s">And</a> they're all new to the, they would all be new to Medford because Medford hasn't had any of them in the past, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3492.898s">So,</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3495.497s">So</a> to my mind, there's two ways of doing it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3498.679s">We</a> could, at the very beginning, say articles 1, 5, and 10, and then sort of list what they are and say, you know, to include just a sentence about these or these are included in the chart, or we could put them in order.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3516.91s">Put</a> them in order.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3527.92s">The</a> proposal is in the recommendation section to at least make reference in order to Articles 1, 5, and 10, name what they are, and come up with a sentence. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3542.7s">That</a> explains their existence in the charter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3545.282s">Does</a> that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3546.803s">Does</a> that sound right units?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3579.142s">That</a> could go to every article, not just those.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3585.971s">I</a> mean, good point.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3590.614s">So,</a> yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3592.075s">So,</a> I guess we'll vote on whether to do that, but I guess what I want to say is if we vote on it and say that language will be crafted as discussed, is that okay?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3620.361s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3621.602s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3621.982s">So</a> does everyone understand what the addition we're talking about is? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3626.006s">That</a> we would put Article 1 before this legislative branch recommendations and then we would do the same for 5 and 10.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3637.812s">Okay,</a> so right now, we have a summary of the major recommendations, and then we go into more detail, and we start with Article 2, because we didn't highlight anything from Article 1. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3652.681s">But</a> the concern is that when you look at that, you say to yourself, well, where's Article 1, and where's Article 5, and where's Article 10? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3662.868s">Where's</a> the concern from? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3665.743s">Some</a> of the people that have read it have read the report.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3673.751s">Well,</a> we're going to, you know, the proposal on the table is that we add.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3687.485s">We're</a> going to vote on it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3688.386s">We'll</a> find out if there's more.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3702.762s">It's</a> not going to change or add any information. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3708.127s">It's</a> just adding in those articles in this sort of outline of the charter and our recommendations to sort of show that they will exist in the charter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3719.199s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3758.259s">OK,</a> thanks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3760.101s">OK,</a> so let's vote on whether we wanted to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3763.503s">Does</a> everyone understand what the proposal is? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3766.885s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3767.886s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3770.128s">All</a> right, let's vote on whether to add it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3772.65s">Danielle?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3774.111s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3775.592s">Jean?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3778.657s">Yes,</a> Eunice? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3780.217s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3782.098s">Phyllis?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3783.698s">Maury?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3786.018s">Anthony</a> Andreadola?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3792.06s">Ron?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3794.78s">I</a> think it's just me, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3797.681s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3799.101s">I'm</a> okay with it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3800.181s">I'll</a> say yes, even though I don't really think we have to, but I'm okay with doing it, so I'll say yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3805.082s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3809.398s">Any</a> other proposals for changes or additions?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3848.145s">So</a> thanks, Anthony. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3849.345s">And</a> I appreciate you bringing that up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3850.806s">I</a> mean, you know, these votes are about a report that that was read by the committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3857.007s">And</a> I so I mean, that's why I didn't ask for public input on it, because, you know, they didn't really read the report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3866.409s">And</a> so it's not really decision making around the charter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3873.471s">But</a> I definitely wanted to make. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3877.073s">Yeah,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3880.095s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3880.635s">I</a> mean, we always ask for it at the end for sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3885.438s">So</a> and Bill, Bill Giglio would like to speak. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3889.781s">So</a> go ahead, Bill. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3896.464s">You're</a> muted, I think.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3919.422s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3919.882s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3925.562s">And</a> I do want to open the floor for any comments from anybody. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3930.028s">But</a> is there anybody on the committee that has any changes or additions to the final report?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3942.861s">Oh,</a> Frances gave us the spelling of, that was from before, Danielle, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3950.507s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3951.548s">And</a> Jean, can you see that Frances put the spelling of Adam's name? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3954.95s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3956.691s">Thank</a> you, Frances. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3958.173s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3959.874s">Okay,</a> so in that case, we're going to vote to accept this final report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3966.107s">And</a> everybody looked at the appendix, you saw, you know, okay with everything that we included, anything else you think we should include? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3973.211s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3974.112s">All</a> right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3975.393s">Final</a> report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3977.294s">So</a> this is, you're going to vote either yes or no to accept this final report with the additions that we made tonight and the changes we made tonight to be submitted to the mayor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3990.582s">Ron.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3995.553s">Okay,</a> sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3997.495s">I</a> made the motion.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4001.199s">Alright,</a> awesome. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4002.881s">Eunice?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4003.561s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4005.684s">Phyllis?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4007.826s">Jean?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4008.887s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4010.609s">Danielle?</a>

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4145.727s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4146.488s">Thanks,</a> Maureen.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4170.488s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4171.408s">This</a> has been in the works for years, you guys. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4173.67s">And</a> I do want to just speak briefly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4177.514s">Francis</a> is putting a note, appreciation note as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4181.457s">Nice</a> job. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4181.937s">I</a> appreciate all the diverse thought perspectives that have led to the completion of this group. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4186.041s">Thank</a> you, Francis. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4188.362s">I</a> want to just talk, before we wrap up, I want to talk briefly about what happens next. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4192.623s">But</a> I also just, like I said, it's been a long time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4196.204s">People</a> have been talking about charter review in the city for so many years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4199.044s">And</a> regardless of what happens next, we, a citizen-led committee, did this work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4206.586s">We</a> did a review. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4207.766s">And</a> that final report will exist. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4211.127s">And</a> no matter what happens, it's there and the work has been done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4215.168s">And</a> I really thank all of you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4217.238s">And</a> I also thank the Collins Center, whose help has been invaluable. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4223.685s">And</a> all the members of the public who came to our meetings and participated. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4227.349s">Because</a> we did have a good amount of public participation when you add up the listening sessions, surveys, and all our meetings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4234.437s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4237.052s">So</a> Jean and I will just coordinate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4239.614s">We</a> will get this to the mayor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4241.895s">And</a> after that, it's basically in the mayor's hands. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4248.9s">And</a> eventually, the city council will be involved. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4253.142s">And</a> we'll see what, I know Eunice did tell everyone about a city council meeting next week. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4261.868s">Next</a> Wednesday night, 7 p.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4265.473s">And</a> if people want to go to that, you know, it's not any, there's no official capacity for us to go to that meeting, but. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4275.296s">Phyllis</a> is laughing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4277.637s">Go</a> to another meeting? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4279.698s">No,</a> no, no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4280.898s">You</a> can read what's in the chat, Melva. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4282.459s">Oh,</a> I'm placing a barbecue for all of you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4287.201s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4291.342s">Maury,</a> I don't know Maury, there's a rumor going around. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4294.734s">Do</a> kind of you Maury, we appreciate it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4298.397s">Oh,</a> really? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4299.919s">What's</a> the rumor? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4301.78s">That</a> you're going to host a barbecue for all of us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4303.922s">Oh,</a> I'll do that any day of the week. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4306.965s">You</a> know that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4314.652s">No,</a> so I can bring that in, whatever you like. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4317.995s">All</a> right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4320.558s">Wait,</a> somebody else had their hand up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4321.859s">Oh,</a> I did. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4322.94s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4355.583s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4361.826s">Well,</a> their meeting is scheduled. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4363.527s">Their</a> first meeting on this is scheduled for Wednesday. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4366.129s">And</a> I don't know that they'll have I don't know what material they'll have seen of ours before that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4372.833s">But</a> Ron and then you know, show up.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4467.169s">That's</a> a good question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4468.269s">I</a> mean, I don't think that there's anything official about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4472.231s">I</a> can tell you that this will be our last meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4475.992s">We</a> don't have any other meetings scheduled and we will be submitting our final report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4482.794s">The</a> mayor might ask us to participate in some meetings in the future. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4488.536s">That's</a> going to be up to her. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4491.348s">I</a> don't know, like, if there's an official dissolution, but we are, you know, we just voted to submit our final report, and that'll be, you know, our work is done.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4553.716s">I</a> hear you, but we are still living with the reality that the council's governance committee is having a meeting on charter review on Wednesday. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4563.761s">It's</a> been publicized. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4564.782s">So</a> I hear you.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4574.95s">I</a> know, or maybe not until the end of the week. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4577.632s">Well,</a> it depends on the timeline.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4604.6s">I</a> don't know if you're correct or incorrect, Anthony. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4607.842s">Let's</a> ask Anthony or Marilyn, I mean, yeah, about that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4651.197s">You</a> mean charter review? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4652.298s">Taken</a> charter review on themselves? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4654.52s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4867.1s">Okay,</a> thanks, Eunice. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4868.24s">Maury,</a> did you wanna say something?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4962.881s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4963.842s">Phyllis?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4991.0s">There</a> was one meeting where those comments were made. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4994.181s">Exactly,</a> yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4995.181s">I</a> do think that they will look at our report and take it seriously. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4999.142s">Well,</a> we hope they will. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5000.922s">I</a> think they will. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5002.263s">We'll</a> see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5003.203s">So</a> do I. Anthony Wilson, can I ask you a question?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5053.892s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5054.412s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5055.033s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5056.093s">Jean.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5110.675s">Yeah,</a> so what I've heard from the mayor is that if committee members want to go to these meetings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5118.06s">It's.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5119.356s">Since</a> we are invested, we're so invested in it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5123.578s">So</a> I guess what I would say is it's up to you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5126.98s">I</a> mean, I hear Ron's point and I do think that it's legitimate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5134.552s">Because</a> we do have this body of work and there is a process that's going to take place where it's going to go to the mayor and then the mayor presents it to the city council. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5144.018s">And</a> it's a little unclear to me what the council is doing at the next two meetings that they've scheduled. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5149.802s">So</a> I think it's okay if people want to attend. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5155.186s">But,</a> you know, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5158.737s">The</a> process that we were appointed for was to create this report for the mayor, which we have done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5165.922s">And</a> then there will be a process that will be up to the mayor, what she does with what we've submitted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5174.908s">So</a> if we do go to the council meetings, I don't think it would be in, I don't know if I would use the word official, but I think it's fine for people to go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5184.015s">And</a> it's unclear, you know, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5189.078s">what</a> we would, I mean, even just to listen, it's fine for people to go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5193.16s">So</a> I think it's up to people whether they want to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5197.463s">Ron?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5259.947s">No,</a> I don't think anybody's pulling out a document but but uh, danielle your question, I mean <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5266.413s">All</a> our meetings have been public. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5268.134s">All</a> our votes have been public. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5269.835s">So</a> I think it's fine if somebody says, well, what's going to happen with ward representation? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5278.34s">I</a> think it's fine to say, well, the committee voted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5281.282s">We</a> can say what we voted on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5283.703s">That's</a> all public.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5295.679s">And</a> you mean if we, if, if some of us, but we wouldn't be meeting as the metric charter study committee.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5306.703s">So</a> we're not calling any of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5308.244s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5308.444s">We're</a> not calling any official meetings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5310.965s">Um,</a> I mean, I mean, when we go to more barbecue, for instance, I don't think we'll violate open meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5316.627s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5351.444s">I</a> think it's fine to let people know when the meetings are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5353.906s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5356.707s">I</a> think that a lot of this is going to become clearer as the process unfolds, it will become clearer.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5383.693s">I'll</a> be in touch about the timeline.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5446.078s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5447.999s">Yeah,</a> like I said, it's unclear exactly and it will become clear as it unfolds. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5454.021s">I</a> think this is all I can really say. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5456.222s">Exactly.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5465.985s">Did</a> you have something else you wanted to say, Ron?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5469.906s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5470.767s">So,</a> um, does anybody, does anybody else on the committee have anything that they want to address or.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5524.964s">Okay,</a> does anybody, any members of the public want to speak?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5578.046s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5603.37s">You</a> guys are all great.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5625.831s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5626.611s">Well,</a> again, I want to just thank you all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5632.233s">It's</a> been a great experience. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5635.874s">Once</a> we get the final report, just make those few changes, clean it up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5639.935s">I</a> will let you-all know when it's submitted so you know that it's been submitted to the mayor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5646.337s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5647.258s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5652.919s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5653.099s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5653.439s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5658.789s">We</a> could not have done it without the call and center. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5660.95s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5661.55s">So</a> okay.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5684.208s">I</a> thank you again everyone around the city.<h2><a href="../2024-09-16_MCM00001426/2024-09-16_MCM00001426.html">Medford Charter Study Committee - Subcommittee 09-12-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1.626s">Welcome</a> everyone to the meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=4.427s">The</a> other two members of our subcommittee are going to try to come late. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=11.03s">So,</a> but first of all, did you all look over the minutes from our July 29th, I think it was? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=21.035s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=22.255s">Are</a> we good? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=23.896s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=25.497s">All</a> in favor?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=28.298s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=29.335s">So</a> they were brief, and we're really coming to the end here, which is exciting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=38.297s">So</a> I thought the minutes might be useful. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=41.698s">We</a> could sort of look at them and see if we completed our tasks from the last meeting, and then we can see what else we need to do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=49.18s">So</a> the first thing was to include survey demographics. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=53.101s">I</a> checked with Danielle. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=57.128s">David</a> is putting together the pie charts, which hopefully he's going to actually also create pie charts for the demographics. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=67.63s">Because</a> last meeting we said we wanted to do that, right?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=74.012s">He</a> did, yeah.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=81.579s">Oh,</a> that's good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=83.319s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=84.36s">Do</a> we care if we have pie charts?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=103.566s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=104.127s">So</a> do you think we should just put the pie charts in the appendix? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=108.375s">I</a> think so. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=108.976s">The</a> survey report as part of the appendix?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=114.02s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=116.942s">I</a> said I was going to add public comments to the issue sheets, which I did. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=120.305s">You</a> did?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=134.102s">Yeah,</a> I definitely added, so what I did was I went through all the survey, well I added whatever public comments that we hadn't added in, which there were a few, and then there were a bunch of comments on the survey. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=146.886s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=147.266s">Because</a> remember, in addition to completing the survey, people were invited to comment.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=153.749s">So,</a> and I think that I, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=160.417s">Where</a> is that document? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=161.638s">I</a> think I reflected in the, I'm trying to find it so I can make sure that I did, but in the actual document that they were comments that were gotten from the survey. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=177.587s">Here</a> we go.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=206.01s">So</a> on the issue sheet, I thought I had all the code. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=210.733s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=211.174s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=211.554s">I</a> don't know what I did, because it looks weird to me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=215.377s">But</a> you look at it and see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=218.638s">Article</a> two, yeah, I put the, okay, yeah, there we go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=222.502s">It's</a> just the preamble that didn't look right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=225.864s">So</a> if you look at it, you can see that there's, like on the left where it's got emails, June 8th public hearing emails, form, so the comments we got from the email form. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=239.336s">Yeah,</a> circle to square, right spawn, and then at the end there's survey, and there's quite a lot of comments there.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=252.009s">Oh,</a> you don't have to change it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=253.31s">But</a> I don't think I'll change that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=255.051s">But</a> we're going to include that in our final report, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=258.752s">The</a> issue sheets? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=261.033s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=269.476s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=270.016s">To</a> the issue sheets.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=275.073s">Okay,</a> so that piece was done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=277.174s">What</a> else did we do? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=280.894s">Oh,</a> you were going to revise Article 8 recommendations to separate out recall? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=286.155s">I</a> did that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=286.735s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=289.316s">I'm</a> pretty sure I did. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=290.596s">Let</a> me double check. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=295.277s">I</a> don't think I have finalized all the footnotes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=298.357s">So</a> that, I was just, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=302.747s">I</a> have to get the footnotes for the award representation, diversity. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=308.271s">Yeah,</a> I have to get a few more footnotes.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=313.674s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=314.415s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=314.615s">So</a> that we need. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=315.635s">So</a> we still need to get footnotes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=323.861s">And</a> I sent you that Mass General Law on the budget, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=328.624s">You</a> did.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=352.939s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=353.419s">And</a> there's a bunch of stuff in the appendix. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=356.622s">Maybe</a> we'll add more to it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=357.863s">Maybe</a> ultimately we'll decide not to include some of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=360.444s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=360.845s">But</a> there's a bunch of stuff in the appendix folder. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=365.562s">We</a> need to just put it together. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=368.444s">So</a> we also, the other thing I didn't do was ask, we were going to ask if anybody has photos. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=375.129s">What</a> do you think? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=375.71s">Do</a> we want to try to do? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=377.551s">I</a> mean, it might make a report look nice if we had pictures, but yeah.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=388.079s">Well,</a> we definitely don't have a lot of pictures.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=400.698s">Do</a> we care?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=402.858s">Then</a> let's not worry about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=405.619s">Because</a> even if we did get pictures from events, we don't necessarily have permission from all the people in the pictures to use them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=413.342s">One</a> thing we could do is, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=417.1s">We</a> do have a banner that we used at events. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=420.102s">If</a> I could somehow put that into a photo and make it a JPEG, we could maybe put that on the cover of the report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=427.808s">I</a> mean, I don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=428.849s">It's</a> just an idea. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=430.75s">I'll</a> try to see if I can capture the banner. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=433.032s">So</a> it would be sort of like using it as a logo.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=454.683s">OK,</a> well, I don't know if that's going to work, but we'll see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=461.227s">So</a> Gene, do you have any other thoughts on what else we need to do in terms of actual content?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=482.518s">I</a> don't know if David is going to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=488.019s">He</a> said he was going to do a survey report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=491.04s">He's</a> making pie charts. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=493.001s">I</a> don't know if that there's going to be any text in it.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=501.418s">I</a> mean, I was thinking about that, but in your community engagement, there is information about the survey. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=509.67s">So</a> I think that's probably sufficient. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=513.315s">And</a> that if we just put the graphics in, what do you think?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=530.429s">For</a> the survey?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=534.53s">I</a> have to get that from Danielle, see if I can pull that off. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=541.212s">If</a> they would just pull that off the Google survey. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=546.474s">OK,</a> we'll get that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=550.303s">I</a> think what you put in the community engagement report about the survey is good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=557.586s">So</a> probably enough in terms of just writing a little text about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=562.568s">I</a> mean, if Javid wants to write some sort of analysis, that's fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=568.39s">But</a> I don't know that he will. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=570.831s">But</a> I don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=571.831s">We'll</a> see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=574.28s">And</a> then, you know, I mean, the recommendations have been read through, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=580.443s">I</a> added the, I added one to the major recommendations. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=587.787s">I</a> added, because we, I put Institute of Financial Reporting Requirement for elected and other officials. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=593.809s">And</a> I need to see if I need to add to Article 9 too.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=624.336s">Yeah,</a> I felt like the only one that was big enough to put in the major recommendations was the financial disclosures. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=630.439s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=631.199s">What</a> do you think?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=641.996s">I</a> thought that was really the only one that we should have, like, sort of pulled out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=647.799s">The</a> other ones are more sort of like, you know, I'm not saying they're minor, but, you know, um, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=657.785s">They're</a> more sort of standard business, you know, standard practice kind of things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=663.087s">Okay,</a> so that I added. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=666.029s">I</a> don't think there's anything else we need to add since the main thing was the financial disclosures.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=680.264s">Yeah,</a> I mean, it's very short. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=681.725s">It</a> just says requirement for annual financial disclosures. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=685.526s">The</a> committee recommends that elected officials and some city officials be required to submit an annual financial disclosure form to be generated and overseen by an ethics commission.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=698.391s">And</a> then, you know, they can read the details in the draft chart. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=704.964s">Okay,</a> so adding the footnotes, other than adding the footnotes, I think we're good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=714.071s">I</a> mean, I'll probably read it over. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=715.892s">I</a> was just reading over the introductory letter and making a little few changes, you know, changing some wording and stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=723.478s">I'm</a> probably going to do that until the end. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=725.579s">Did</a> the full committee weigh it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=728.842s">Oh,</a> no, we're going to send it to them once we put it all together. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=732.509s">I</a> mean, I sent them the draft versions, but nobody had anything to say. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=737.812s">I</a> don't think anybody read it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=738.912s">I</a> think they were too busy working on their draft charter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=742.274s">So</a> the idea is that the Collins Center is going to get the revised draft charter with the typos fixed and the things that we added since they sent us the draft charter and the changes that we made. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=762.887s">I've</a> asked them to get that to me within the next week to two weeks so that I'm going to proofread it one more time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=771.695s">Then</a> if we can get this final report part together, we would just put it all in one package and send it to the committee and then we can <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=784.788s">at</a> our meeting in October, which would be, which is our final meeting, we will just see if anybody has any, I mean, the same thing we did for the draft charter, I don't expect there to be any big, but you know, any big things that we're gonna, but maybe somebody will say, why didn't we say this in the recommendations or, you know, so we'll see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=807.865s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=812.528s">But</a> I don't think it'll take more than one week.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=815.69s">As</a> long as they're not trying to re-vote on the charter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=819.313s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=822.916s">That</a> part is done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=825.378s">It's</a> just a question of whether anybody thinks that they don't like the wording in the final report or mostly I think it will be if somebody thinks there should be something else added to the recommendations or we should pull this out and emphasize it.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=845.597s">So</a> that's what I was going to ask. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=849.098s">And</a> you have whatever your software you're going to use? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=852.06s">I</a> was just going to do Microsoft Word. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=854.661s">Yeah,</a> as long as it looks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=856.222s">I</a> don't care as long as it looks decent.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=868.75s">So</a> do you need any help? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=873.231s">What</a> do you need for that?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=880.812s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=884.113s">Let</a> me give myself a deadline. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=887.573s">Let's</a> see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=888.053s">Today's</a> the 12th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=889.654s">Monday</a> is the 17th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=895.595s">Let</a> me do it by the 18th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=898.123s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=899.784s">And</a> then possibly you could start putting some things together like the, you know, the, the beginning, if, if I can manage to get an image of the banner, otherwise you can probably do something graphic like with Microsoft word. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=917.433s">Um,</a> but there's, um, the members, you know, that little, well, we're going to put all the members at the beginning.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=933.685s">Well,</a> I put it in there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=935.667s">What</a> I'm wondering is, yeah, no, I think it's better to put it at the front as opposed to at the end of the introductory letter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=944.533s">I</a> think that makes more sense.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=956.69s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=957.95s">And</a> then I think major recommendations.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=963.392s">What</a> about the appendix is until the end. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=968.914s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=969.154s">So</a> then introductory major recommend, wait a minute. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=971.895s">Introductory</a> letter comes before major recommendations, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=975.436s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=977.097s">And</a> then do you think the community engagement summary? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=980.738s">No,</a> maybe the community engagement summary should come before major recommendations.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=986.883s">What</a> do you think? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=987.463s">Does</a> that make sense?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=990.426s">Because</a> then after major recommendations, you want to go into the- Then you go into each article, which we don't have any for Article 1, which hopefully, you know, no one's going to be like, what's going on? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1002.737s">But</a> Article 1 is just definitions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1005.84s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1006.58s">I</a> mean, the only major recommendation we have for Article 1 is to include an article <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1013.151s">Because</a> we don't have one in our current charter, but I don't think it's worth, yeah, we'll just leave that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1023.298s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1024.879s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1026.32s">I</a> think, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1028.421s">And</a> I think the appendix goes at the very end. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1031.744s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1034.425s">So</a> that's the table of contents materials, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1039.773s">When</a> we get to the appendix, you know, you can make, you can use your judgment in terms of how to arrange what's in the appendix. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1049.503s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1050.343s">The</a> thing, for footnotes, we are, we're just going to <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1058.687s">Footnote</a> within the text that we're footnoting right those don't go at the end. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1063.669s">No,</a> I don't.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1069.371s">Yeah,</a> I agree. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1074.142s">Let's</a> see if I can remember. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1075.563s">Oh,</a> like in the introductory letter, there was reference to, like, we're including a couple of the, we're including the generic modern charter in the appendix that we used as a guide, and we're including the, some memos from the Collins Center, and they're, like, I can change it and take them out, but I made reference to them in the introductory letter, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1103.718s">I</a> put in parentheses appendix number x. But we could take out that if you think it's- No, I can even put a hyperlink so if people want to- Yeah, if you wanted to do that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1119.611s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1121.032s">All</a> right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1121.492s">So</a> that's all you need, just the actual content.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1137.574s">And</a> if it would be helpful, I mean, maybe it's just easier for you to do it on your own. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1143.938s">But</a> if it would be helpful for us for me to do anything, or for me to be there and help you just let me know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1151.904s">Yeah,</a> it's kind of a one person. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1153.705s">Yeah,</a> that's what I figured.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1161.527s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1162.208s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1164.149s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1165.71s">So</a> I don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1167.631s">Can</a> you think of anything else? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1168.792s">I</a> mean, I want to go at least another 15 minutes in case David jumps up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1176.517s">But</a> I knew this would be quick. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1177.798s">I</a> mean, basically, we have most of it done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1180.94s">We've</a> just got to wrap up the details and then put it together.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1195.163s">No,</a> I that's right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1196.364s">It's</a> planning at this point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1197.745s">We're</a> not making any. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1199.286s">So</a> we're not making any decisions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1203.609s">Any</a> decisions that are made about the final report that we put together will be made at the final public meeting of our committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1211.534s">So</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1225.555s">Easy.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1235.825s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1236.086s">Well,</a> we've gone through our list. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1237.306s">We've</a> done our work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1238.887s">The</a> work that needs to be done now is just work sitting at our desks, right?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1250.774s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1251.354s">How</a> long do you think you'll need?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1258.348s">Our</a> next meeting, our committee meeting is, I think, October 3rd. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1263.491s">So</a> ideally, you know, if I could get it to the committee two weeks in advance, that would be nice because I can use them, but I don't even know when I'm going to get the charter from the call-in centers. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1277.079s">I</a> mean, I've tried to emphasize to them that I wanted it soon. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1282.608s">So</a> that's the 19th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1286.729s">Oh</a> my gosh, that's really soon. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1288.51s">Yeah,</a> I'll try to do the footnotes this weekend. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1292.011s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1299.053s">Yeah,</a> we made a deadline at our last meeting, deadline for edited final report August 12th, but I guess, you know, it's summer.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1312.282s">That's</a> right, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1313.323s">And</a> this we are because our final meeting is October 3rd. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1316.849s">Okay,</a> awesome. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1320.916s">Maureen,</a> made a motion to adjourn? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1323.079s">I</a> second. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1325.243s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1325.864s">See</a> you all soon. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-subcommittee-09-12-24&start=1327.206s">Thanks,</a> everybody.<h2><a href="../2024-09-06_MCM00001363/2024-09-06_MCM00001363.html">Medford Charter Study Committee 09-05-24</a></h2>

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=24.224s">Any</a> opposed? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=26.145s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=27.806s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=28.961s">All</a> right, so our work for tonight is to, we got last time, we got through the first three articles of the draft charter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=44.191s">So</a> our work tonight is to get through the rest of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=49.774s">So</a> I'm just going to open the floor and ask if anybody has any amendments that they want to propose. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=58.465s">starting</a> with Article 4. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=64.967s">Anything</a> in Article 4?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=147.172s">Anthony</a> or someone from the Collins Center, can you speak to that?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=196.45s">Okay,</a> so Eunice, do you want, are you making a proposal that we add that language so that the term of office for the school committee is consistent with the city council and the mayor?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=226.335s">Well,</a> the city council is also the first Monday in January.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=241.042s">Yeah,</a> and the school committee just says the first business day of January, not necessarily the first Monday, right?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=253.509s">So,</a> Ron.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=419.063s">Yeah,</a> so I think that that's consistent with the language we have now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=423.806s">So</a> I'm going to throw out and say, Eunice, tell me if this sounds like what you intend, that a motion to make the language in Article 4.1 under term of office consistent with the mayor and the city council, to make the eligibility language, I mean, the term of office language consistent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=445.422s">with</a> all three elected bodies. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=447.523s">Is</a> that what you're going for? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=449.724s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=450.345s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=450.545s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=451.385s">All</a> right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=451.746s">Seconded.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=453.046s">OK,</a> great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=454.467s">Everybody</a> understands what we're voting on?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=463.412s">OK,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=472.833s">So,</a> and yeah, we can send that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=474.854s">I</a> mean, I was thinking maybe the call-in center would just standardize it for us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=478.976s">Does</a> that sound right, Anthony Wilson? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=481.657s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=483.498s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=484.198s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=484.698s">So</a> all in favor, well, let's do a roll call. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=487.94s">Anthony</a> Andriado. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=490.001s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=492.121s">Eunice.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=492.962s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=495.343s">Ron.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=504.884s">Well,</a> the motion is that we'll just make the language consistent and leave it to the Collins Center to standardize for us.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=522.371s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=523.865s">But</a> this motion is that we're just standardizing it and the call-in center will use the best language. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=533.029s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=533.31s">Phyllis?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=542.414s">Gene?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=543.675s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=545.896s">Maury?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=548.857s">David?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=551.431s">And</a> I'm also yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=552.571s">OK,</a> great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=553.412s">So</a> that passes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=555.713s">Does</a> anybody have any other amendments or changes to Article 4?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=585.189s">There</a> it is.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=632.872s">Okay,</a> so we should standardize that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=635.734s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=636.835s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=642.995s">Okay,</a> while we're, can I broaden this section? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=647.559s">This</a> district eligibility, because I noticed another issue that doesn't match up or that's not consistent where about <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=665.681s">the</a> about moving, whether if the school committee member moves from Medford, then the office shall be immediately deemed vacant. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=674.866s">Um,</a> and in the city council, I believe we had if the if the if a ward Councilor moved from the ward and stayed in Medford, that Councilor could finish out their term. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=688.154s">So</a> I'm wondering if we want to add that in.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=695.355s">Uh,</a> OK.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=704.801s">Right,</a> that's right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=707.363s">I</a> guess I guess I'm just wondering whether the fact that it's not specified might raise questions for people. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=717.397s">And</a> it is specified in the city council section.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=745.588s">Okay,</a> so <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=750.069s">Maybe</a> we'll do them separately just to avoid confusion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=753.692s">So</a> the first thing that we're going to vote on is whether the person has to reside in the district from one year prior to nomination papers or one year prior to inauguration. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=769.802s">Can</a> I ask the call-in center whether you have any comments on whether one of these is preferable?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=785.572s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=787.534s">Okay,</a> so. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=790.01s">Do</a> you want to, David, since you are bringing that up and saying you preferred inauguration, do you want to make that motion?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=861.567s">Anthony</a> Wilson, did you have a comment?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=910.688s">That</a> issue is <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=916.653s">different</a> than the one we were about to vote on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=921.736s">So</a> let's stick with our motion and then we'll go and discuss the voter issue. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=928.359s">Ron?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=983.571s">Anthony</a> Wilson.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1070.208s">You</a> mean the signatures?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1200.284s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1201.265s">So</a> I guess that we can't prevent everything in the world, but we can put language in to make it <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1210.19s">more</a> streamlined and easier if such a thing does occur.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1232.397s">Okay,</a> so next month is the final report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1234.699s">So</a> we'll make note of that and we can talk about adding that next month if it didn't get in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1242.165s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1245.233s">Okay,</a> so the motion is that under district eligibility in all, not just school committee, not just 401, but we make that consistent with city council and we use one year prior to inauguration.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1268.395s">We</a> don't have the residency requirement with mayor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1271.667s">Oh,</a> we don't? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1272.507s">It's</a> just with ward Councilors and school committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1278.288s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1280.909s">I'll</a> second it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1281.869s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1282.909s">All</a> right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1284.429s">I'm</a> going to do that thing again where I can't see everybody because I'm sharing screen, so I'm going to try to do it by memory. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1290.97s">Eunice.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1291.83s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1293.331s">David.</a>

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1311.467s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1314.569s">I'm</a> yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1316.17s">Did</a> I get everybody? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1321.754s">Okay,</a> so the next issue that we had in section 4.1 <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1329.806s">was</a> to standardize if someone moves out of, in this case, for the school committee, it's the district.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1347.959s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1348.66s">So</a> let's be clear about what the motion is, that we're standardizing language.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1360.135s">Yes,</a> okay, so we don't have, yeah, and that's what the city council says. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1364.557s">So</a> the motion is that if a district school committee member moves out of the district during their term and stays within Medford, they're allowed to finish out their term. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1378.525s">I'll</a> second it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1381.647s">Okay,</a> Daveed.

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1465.328s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1466.169s">Then</a> there's no proposal to change that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1468.609s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1468.81s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1470.35s">All</a> right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1470.79s">Anybody</a> have any other changes in article four?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1481.793s">Nobody</a> does, so go ahead.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1567.005s">Well,</a> I think the language was deleted, so I don't think it may be. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1571.708s">I</a> don't think it would. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1574.31s">Yeah,</a> well, Paulette didn't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1577.434s">contact</a> me with any amendments, first of all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1580.336s">But</a> I don't think we say anything about the handling of the bills or anything. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1586.919s">I</a> think that was deleted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1589.401s">I</a> don't think it means that that system can't continue just because we took it out.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1602.488s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1619.908s">That's</a> right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1621.849s">So</a> does that change what you, do you still want to look at adding it back in, Eunice?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1662.638s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1663.198s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1664.239s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1796.153s">Anthony</a> Wilson, do you remember? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1799.014s">Let's</a> see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1802.875s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1804.318s">Go</a> ahead, Anthony.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1816.068s">Yeah,</a> but we're talking, we're talking about, um, that in the memo from the call-in center, they recommended mirroring the city council vacancy provision, which I think we're, we're, we agree is a good idea. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1829.037s">And</a> but the other part of it was suggesting that the committee consider allowing the school committee and city council to fill the vacancy joint. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1837.12s">So</a> that's, can you, Anthony Wilson, talk about maybe the reasoning behind that recommendation?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1963.709s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1980.786s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1983.549s">Yeah,</a> I mean, the typos and things will get to those. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1988.814s">I,</a> you know, we've actually already addressed.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=1998.95s">Ah,</a> I see.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2006.114s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2010.217s">So</a> we've heard the reasons for potentially having the city council involved. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2023.464s">I</a> mean, I think the first level is that it's the next highest vote ever, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2038.114s">The</a> only time appointment is going to happen is if there's nobody to do that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2097.486s">I</a> mean, no, I think along the lines of the Collins Center argument, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2104.273s">the</a> threshold of, you know, those people didn't get a very high threshold of votes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2109.402s">And</a> then the city council who did get the votes and represents the whole city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2114.47s">I</a> mean, you could look at it that way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2116.153s">That's</a> all I'm saying.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2146.223s">OK,</a> so now we have another idea on the table, which is to lower the threshold to 20%, not less than 20% of the total vote cast gene.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2167.272s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2183.489s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2183.809s">So</a> we've had a discussion about this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2185.79s">Does</a> anybody want to make a proposal on any of the issues we've been discussing? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2191.572s">I</a> want to, I would, uh, Jean.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2213.551s">I</a> second that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2215.373s">Okay,</a> Daveed?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2220.637s">Okay,</a> so we are voting on <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2227.554s">that</a> a person after the 30% threshold and after, if the position still needs to be filled, that the school committee would fill the position.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2268.085s">So,</a> basically, it's to leave the language the way it is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2271.667s">And</a> 2, we're just reiterating that because.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2279.313s">We're</a> going to vote on that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2280.213s">We're</a> going to see.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2310.653s">Yeah,</a> no, we're not talking about that right now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2312.514s">We're</a> just talking about when a opening needs to be filled that can't be filled by someone who has run and met that 30% threshold currently, as it is, then the motion on the table is that we leave this as is and say that the city council will fill the vacancy, which is contrary to the recommendation of the policy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2338.773s">You</a> mean the school committee? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2341.955s">Did</a> I misspeak? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2343.015s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2345.717s">The</a> school committee fills the vacancies. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2349.019s">If</a> you vote yes, you're voting for the school committee to fill the vacancy and not the city council. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2355.982s">Is</a> that clear to everyone? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2360.064s">David?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2361.705s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2363.967s">Ron?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2368.169s">Maury?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2370.309s">Eunice.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2371.389s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2372.55s">Jean.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2374.93s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2376.47s">Anthony</a> Andreadov.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2380.351s">Phyllis.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2381.552s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2383.812s">I'm</a> a no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2385.912s">Unfortunately,</a> we have a tie because we only have eight people here tonight. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2396.335s">I</a> think then that means the yes gets it.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2418.409s">Well,</a> we're split on that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2421.489s">The</a> eight people that are here now are split on that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2454.909s">I</a> mean to me this isn't the affairs of the school committee It's who's on the school committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2459.79s">So</a> that's not <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2461.625s">The</a> affairs of the school committee are the job of the school committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2466.906s">That's</a> how I see it.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2512.6s">You're</a> also talking about the mayor, because the mayor's on the school committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2518.263s">So.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2520.364s">Ron.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2546.061s">Okay,</a> Maury.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2590.693s">Yeah,</a> and actually, yeah, Danielle actually told me she would be here late, so. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2598.511s">We're</a> missing Danielle, we're missing Paulette, and we're missing- I know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2601.613s">We</a> might get Danielle tonight, but okay.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2624.051s">Well,</a> the motion was that the language would stay the same, and it was tied. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2630.215s">And</a> if the motion falls, that means the language wouldn't stay the same. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2633.397s">But</a> we didn't vote on what to change the language to, although I think it's already. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2636.74s">Everybody</a> knows what the choices are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2638.941s">Just</a> so far, I'm clear.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2649.628s">No,</a> I don't.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2700.952s">I</a> think <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2702.17s">Ron,</a> what we're going to do is we're going to take this vote again when Danielle shows up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2708.114s">Because</a> you're right, it's possible that at our next meeting we won't have the other three of us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2714.498s">So</a> let's take the vote again.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2723.443s">Yes,</a> we can.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2725.705s">So</a> we're going to revisit it when Danielle gets here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2728.566s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2729.627s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2731.068s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2734.562s">There</a> was some, does anybody, do we have anything else? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2737.224s">It</a> was discussion about lowering the threshold and then Jean pointed out that it's 30% with city council. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2742.627s">So</a> does somebody want to make a proposal to make a change?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2751.953s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2753.794s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2754.935s">Anything</a> else in article four? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2757.597s">I'm</a> good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2759.855s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2760.815s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2761.795s">Article</a> 5. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2764.556s">Article</a> 5, which is short. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2768.777s">And</a> it was pretty much boilerplate language, but does anybody have anything they want to change for that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2773.898s">Administrative</a> procedures? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2775.618s">Administrative</a> organization? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2777.638s">All</a> right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2777.918s">What</a> about Article 6 is financial procedures?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2842.722s">So</a> your proposal is that whenever there's an incidence in the charter that says that something needs to be publicized in a local newspaper, that that language is changed to?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2872.17s">Meanwhile,</a> Maury, did you want to say something?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2949.102s">Collin</a> Center, can you speak to this? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=2953.284s">Because</a> this is obviously not, other communities deal with this decline of newspapers as well.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3053.378s">Maury,</a> did you want to say something?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3102.277s">I</a> mean, I guess my interpretation of newspaper is that it doesn't have to be a paper newspaper. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3108.799s">It</a> can be an electronic newspaper or some sort of newsletter or something. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3113.68s">But</a> anyway, that's just my interpretation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3115.781s">Ron?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3152.063s">So</a> you're saying we should change newspaper, Ron? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3154.926s">I</a> just want to be clear on what you're saying.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3173.77s">Yeah,</a> I just want to circle back for one second to Anthony's. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3178.213s">I</a> just want to, Anthony, can you address again that this language is a reflection of state law because this is state law still says newspaper?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3203.743s">But</a> do you feel that because of that, that the charter should say that as well, or do you think it's fine to change it?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3238.513s">OK,</a> Marilyn, did you want to add to that?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3364.285s">So,</a> Marilyn, would you think that leaving newspaper and adding something else would be specific? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3371.926s">Is</a> that what you're? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3373.787s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3374.247s">Yes,</a> that's where I'm going. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3377.168s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3378.448s">Jean.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3469.008s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3470.689s">Maury</a> and Ron, did you want to say something? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3473.171s">Maury,</a> did you want to say something?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3498.248s">Okay,</a> Ron, did you have another point?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3511.956s">Okay,</a> so I just want to check in with David and see in light of this discussion, because you did have a proposal on the table. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3520.702s">So</a> I just want to check in with David about that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3598.681s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3599.221s">So</a> I'm, um, I'm going to throw out a proposal and say that <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3606.153s">First</a> of all, I'm going to propose that we leave newspaper and add city website. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3611.394s">So</a> we say newspaper and city website. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3615.455s">And</a> also just want to say in conjunction with that, that it doesn't mean that the city can't publicize things in other places. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3622.636s">It's</a> just the charter says this is what they have to do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3627.437s">It</a> doesn't stop them from doing other things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3631.818s">So,</a> and I guess, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3635.633s">As</a> I said before, to me, newspaper includes digital media.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3681.395s">Well,</a> we could, but I think that falls under Marilyn's comment about being vague. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3690.38s">Because</a> it's not defined. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3691.841s">It's</a> not defined. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3693.901s">That's</a> true. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3694.462s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3695.722s">If</a> we say newspaper and city website, that's defined. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3699.784s">It</a> doesn't prevent the city from putting it out in other places, but it defines the minimum that they have to do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3706.606s">Would</a> you agree with that, Anthony Wilson?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3714.295s">Okay,</a> so that's my proposal that, you know, we keep newspaper in all the places where it says things have to be disseminated by newspaper, but we add that newspaper and city website.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3727.86s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3748.49s">It</a> could be, I mean.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3756.174s">You're</a> saying is there a requirement in the charter?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3763.779s">I</a> don't think there is in our current charter.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3808.403s">But</a> we're talking about more than just city meetings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3811.125s">We're</a> talking about other things because the charter references all kinds of stuff that has to be shared with the public, not just meetings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3820.593s">Danielle,</a> welcome. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3822.254s">Right</a> now, there's a motion on the table that wherever the charter directs that something has to be publicized to the public in a newspaper, we're going to add city website so that there would be required by the charter <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3838.495s">to</a> put it in a newspaper and on the city website. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3843.437s">Daveed?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3850.339s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3851.279s">I</a> thought you had... Okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3855.041s">Let's</a> go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3855.421s">I</a> thought you had sort of let it go, but I'm sorry if I misunderstood.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3863.844s">All</a> good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3864.744s">Then</a> can you just state what you want your motion to be?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3881.211s">OK,</a> and that language is in the chat.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3885.134s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3885.995s">All</a> right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3886.555s">So.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3893.121s">Phyllis.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3902.429s">No,</a> we're doing Daveed's first. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3903.949s">We're</a> doing Daveed's.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3909.691s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3911.452s">So</a> we're doing Daveed's first. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3914.013s">Um,</a> Eunice? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3915.213s">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3917.314s">Uh,</a> Anthony Andreottola?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3921.075s">Uh,</a> Ron Giovino?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3925.417s">Uh,</a> Daveed?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3929.879s">Jean.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3937.885s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3940.067s">Did</a> I get you, Rory?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3944.15s">I'm</a> also a no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3945.531s">So</a> that doesn't pass. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3948.093s">And</a> now we'll vote on my motion, which is to <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3953.178s">where</a> it to keep the word newspaper wherever the charter specifies it and add city website.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3967.068s">Okay,</a> so Phyllis, go ahead.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3971.931s">Maury.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3974.313s">Ron.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3976.754s">Daveed.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3980.537s">Gene.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3981.778s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3984.299s">Eunice.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3985.22s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3989.302s">Danielle.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3991.883s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3994.404s">Who</a> did I miss?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3998.366s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3998.786s">Thank</a> you, Anthony. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=3999.926s">And</a> I'm also a yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4000.887s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4001.647s">So</a> that's good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4003.228s">We</a> got that passed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4005.912s">All</a> right, so before we start Article VI, I want to go back to the tie vote that we had so that we can retake that vote. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4015.255s">Danielle,</a> the pressure is on you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4017.135s">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4020.456s">Danielle,</a> we had a tie vote, so we would like to revisit it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4025.258s">And</a> it was under filling vacancies on the school committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4029.519s">The</a> current draft says that <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4033.397s">If</a> there's nobody, if there's a vacancy and a candidate and the next candidate who didn't get elected and who meets at least 30% of the vote isn't available, then the school committee chooses the replacement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4050.72s">That's</a> what we currently have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4053.1s">And</a> the Collins Center made a recommendation that the city council do it rather than the school committee because the city council <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4062.545s">The</a> school committee's job is narrow and focused on running the school department, and the city council represents the whole city and the workings of the city, so that they recommend that the city council do it and that that's common practice in other cities. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4078.374s">And</a> I'm going to let Anthony Wilson.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4096.212s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4097.112s">Did</a> everybody understand that the first time around? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4102.594s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4103.694s">So</a> let's retake that vote. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4105.114s">So</a> basically what we're going to vote on is that currently we have just the school committee doing it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4111.096s">Now</a> we have the school committee and the city council doing it together. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4114.957s">That's</a> what we would be voting on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4116.717s">So</a> if you vote yes, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4120.865s">you</a> want, this isn't exactly how we did the vote last time, but we'll do it this way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4125.308s">We'll</a> simplify it this way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4127.05s">If</a> you vote yes, you're saying yes, it should be the city council and the school committee together, and if you vote no, you're saying no, it should just be the school committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4136.236s">Does</a> that make sense? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4138.078s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4139.078s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4168.498s">Well,</a> let's see where the vote falls. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4171.539s">So</a> this is a vote to have the city council and the school committee involved in replacing a <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4181.773s">vacancy</a> on the school committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4187.215s">Ron?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4190.816s">Jean?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4195.458s">Eunice?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4196.678s">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4199.379s">Phyllis?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4202.46s">Anthony</a> Andreottola?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4207.342s">Danielle?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4208.883s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4211.54s">Maury,</a> did I get you?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4215.242s">Daveed?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4219.063s">And</a> I'm a yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4220.084s">So</a> that motion carries. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4222.645s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4223.345s">So</a> the call-in center will change that language. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4228.147s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4228.767s">So</a> now we're on Article 6. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4230.548s">Did</a> anybody have any amendments that they wanted to propose to Article 6? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4234.45s">I</a> did. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4235.53s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4383.058s">I</a> mean, you both have good points, but Gene makes a good point about the budget ordinance that specifies March 1st as a date for the city council to, can you say again, the city council is submitting their budget recommendations to the mayor on March 1st?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4423.605s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4424.766s">It</a> says on or before March 1st now.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4445.862s">All</a> right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4446.803s">Let's</a> see what other people. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4448.164s">Eunice,</a> did you have a comment about this?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4478.915s">Oh,</a> I can tell you they were concerned about being able to fulfill this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4486.219s">But</a> that was one of the reasons that we generalized the language. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4491.903s">Because</a> people still wanted to keep it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4494.187s">committee</a> members still wanted to keep it, but there was a concern.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4500.188s">David?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4575.049s">Well,</a> currently it just says to review the financial condition of the city and share relevant information.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4601.011s">And</a> one of the things that people expressed on this committee and in the public was that they wanted more collaboration and they wanted more interaction between the branches of government. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4610.679s">And</a> that was one of the other reasons for this.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4692.911s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4693.771s">Ron.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4735.78s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4737.261s">So</a> I think, Jean, your original proposal, you said February 1st, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4742.464s">I</a> did. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4743.325s">On</a> or before February 1st, changing March 1st to February 1st. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4746.266s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4747.507s">Thank</a> you, Ron. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4748.347s">Maury,</a> did you want to speak? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4753.171s">Maury,</a> maybe he stepped up.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4832.5s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4833.42s">All</a> right, we're gonna, oh, Eunice, you have one more point?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4842.604s">Jean,</a> how do you feel about that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4844.464s">That's</a> fine with me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4846.265s">Okay,</a> so we'll vote on that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4847.866s">But</a> before we do, I just want to ask if the Collins Center has anything to add to this discussion about an annual budget meeting and <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4860.021s">Yeah,</a> there were a lot of dates as I understand it in the budget ordinance, and that was a concern, was conflicting with the ordinance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4869.374s">So</a> I'm glad you brought that up, but I would like to know if Anthony Wilson or Marilyn have any thoughts about this.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4910.601s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4911.681s">I</a> mean, I guess I'm slightly concerned about February 15th because the people who would be doing this express concern about being able to get information together. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4926.344s">But</a> we also, I guess, conflicting with the budget ordinance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4932.365s">I</a> mean, the charter would supersede the ordinance, although they're two different things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4940.258s">I</a> think they would both exist, right, Anthony? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4943.3s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4980.038s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4980.518s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4981.039s">I</a> mean, based on what we've heard and what I understand, I don't know how much information they're going to get in February anyway. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4988.644s">But</a> yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4993.666s">If</a> we're doing this, people feel strongly about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=4997.587s">And</a> so February 15th, we'll change it to February 15th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5003.189s">That's</a> the proposal on the table. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5005.61s">OK?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5007.471s">I'll</a> second it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5008.311s">So</a> does everyone understand what they're voting on? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5013.053s">A</a> yes is we're changing from March 1st to February 15th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5018.194s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5019.795s">Maury?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5024.386s">Jean.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5026.507s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5027.607s">David.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5030.728s">Danielle.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5033.349s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5034.969s">Phyllis.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5036.11s">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5039.09s">Ron,</a> did you vote?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5045.572s">Anthony</a> Andriodala.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5049.982s">I</a> missed one person. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5050.843s">I</a> met with Eunice. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5053.925s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5055.046s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5055.866s">I'm</a> going to vote no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5056.947s">So,</a> all right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5058.028s">So</a> that carries. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5059.049s">So</a> we'll change that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5060.63s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5061.591s">Anybody</a> else have anything in an article six?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5100.863s">Maury,</a> do you want to speak to that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5103.983s">Want</a> to repeat?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5187.527s">Thanks,</a> Maury. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5188.767s">I</a> mean, my recollection was that there was concern about doing it annually, but... Yeah, they had concerns about, you know, what works best for them, you know, and... I agree, right.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5202.953s">It's</a> also was, you know, we're reporting as a communication secondhand and... <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5211.421s">I</a> feel that since the Collins Center has strongly told us that this is standard practice and it's important, is that correct? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5222.406s">Then</a> I feel comfortable with it.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5241.776s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5243.717s">Elections,</a> Article 7. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5245.577s">Anybody</a> want to make any amendments there?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5295.842s">You</a> don't remember what section it is? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5297.363s">I'm</a> just skimming.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5396.687s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5399.669s">Anything</a> else in article 7? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5400.69s">Okay,</a> article 8. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5406.656s">Anybody</a> have any? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5412.562s">Everybody</a> okay? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5415.524s">Article</a> 8, anybody? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5421.367s">I</a> have one change to Article 8.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5444.209s">Yeah,</a> my proposal is very simple. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5448.152s">It's</a> not complicated. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5449.013s">8-5,</a> which is about recall. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5457.8s">Let</a> me find where the party. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5474.115s">A</a> recall petition may be initiated. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5476.196s">I'm</a> not going to find the language. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5485.8s">Let</a> me see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5486.24s">I'm</a> looking for... Oh, here it is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5490.682s">It's</a> down here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5492.859s">And</a> there it is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5494.519s">It</a> happens to be highlighted right now, where it says, from which removal is sought in the grounds of recall, as stated in the affidavit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5503.862s">So</a> since the recalls that we're proposing are not for cause, I'm suggesting that we remove grounds of recall.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5522.307s">I</a> thought that you that recall, you could just get the signatures to recall someone and you didn't have to say why.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5540.357s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5541.517s">That's</a> not what my understanding was about recalls. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5544.979s">Jean,</a> do you remember when we discussed this?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5628.116s">Well,</a> what I remember is that we read some materials that indicated that <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5635.146s">in</a> Massachusetts, and maybe what Marilyn is referring to is the fact that it's not in state law and it's just by charter, but that you could do recalls just with signatures for no particular cause, and said causes are not defined. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5651.977s">But</a> I think maybe what Marilyn is saying, and you can correct me, Marilyn, if I'm misunderstanding, is that it's going to come up at some point anyway. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5663.238s">So</a> it's best to include it.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5685.488s">That's</a> what it says now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5686.708s">Daveed?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5710.694s">No,</a> well, in light of this discussion, I'm withdrawing because I think, you know, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5717.077s">I</a> understand now the distinction and the reason that it's there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5724.24s">If</a> anybody else wants to bring it up, they can, but I'm good with it the way it is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5735.084s">Nobody</a> else has anything in Article 8?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5777.089s">Is</a> it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5777.83s">Oh,</a> are you looking at the recommendation sheet, not the active?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5792.661s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5793.262s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5796.844s">I'll</a> second that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5798.226s">So</a> what we're voting on is adding that every member of <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5807.392s">the</a> committee received a copy of the solicitor's decision, and this is in reference to recalls, right?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5880.968s">I'm</a> having trouble finding it right now, but let's just look at it on the screen and then we can. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5887.775s">So,</a> we believe that it is there.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5912.183s">So,</a> we're good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5912.663s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5912.823s">All</a> right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5913.703s">I'm</a> going to draw. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5915.124s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5915.624s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5916.807s">All</a> right, we're good on that one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5920.13s">Okay,</a> so we're good with article eight? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5925.995s">Now</a> nine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5930.558s">Anybody</a> have anything? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=5931.639s">I</a> mean, we had a new section added to article nine about the financial statements.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6019.347s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6021.472s">Anthony,</a> do you want to address that?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6145.98s">You're</a> saying you wanted similar requirements to apply to other sections?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6180.133s">The</a> ordinance, it says that copies of any recommendation shall be made available to the public at a cost not to exceed the actual cost of the reproduction. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6188.335s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6193.637s">My</a> apologies. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6195.517s">Anybody</a> have anything else in article 9?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6214.739s">I</a> feel like we did talk about it and we voted on it and we didn't vote.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6257.497s">I</a> think that would have been in, what's that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6262.639s">Multi-member</a> bodies are addressed in another article. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6265.16s">Is</a> that right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6266.04s">Am</a> I imagining things?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6298.869s">I'm</a> not finding it right now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6306.273s">So</a> that language, Eunice, can you read it again, please?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6366.269s">What</a> I want to ask is what section would that go under? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6369.231s">Would</a> that go under the appointment section or would it go under the article 9?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6380.659s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6383.16s">So</a> I need to just make sure that that gets in there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6387.003s">First,</a> I'm going to look back and <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6389.343s">just</a> refresh myself on what meeting we discussed that and when we voted.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6432.378s">I'm</a> going to look. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6433.82s">Yeah,</a> go ahead, Ron.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6440.685s">No,</a> we didn't last meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6444.798s">Well,</a> it wasn't last meeting, but we finished it up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6448.621s">That's</a> why we got the draft charter with everything in it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6451.823s">But</a> we did have something added to it, which was the financial statements.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6459.769s">I</a> don't know what we... Well, we may not... If nobody brought it up, we didn't discuss it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6467.335s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6481.953s">Okay,</a> so I will pull up that language and make sure it gets added to the appropriate section.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6575.519s">So</a> you wanna question that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6648.481s">Marilyn</a> and Anthony, can you just speak a little bit about sort of how this kind of thing works in practice? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6656.846s">Is</a> the city council involved generally or?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6840.422s">You</a> asked about section 917, which I think to me, what I read is that it just says that the municipal employees have to comply with the state conflict of interest laws.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6869.402s">So,</a> Ron, are you looking to propose that we just delete the waiver or that it be maybe have,
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6892.352s">That</a> to me is checks and balances. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6896.115s">You</a> wanted to say that this section may be waived by the mayor with approval of the city council?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6917.749s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6918.389s">And</a> I just wanted to hear from Marilyn and Anthony whether, you know, I'm just only interested in standard practice and whether that's typical or whether there's a reason not to do that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6965.017s">Okay,</a> so I guess my thing is I always think if something is standard language, maybe sometimes there's no reason, but maybe sometimes there is a reason. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6973.101s">So</a> I was just trying to sort of discern whether there's a reason to keep this way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6978.944s">And</a> I'm just thinking about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=6980.765s">I</a> don't know, maybe there's a scenario where it makes sense to fill this position of employment, fill with two positions with the same person and
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=7051.997s">Okay,</a> thank you, Jean.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=7182.86s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=7183.961s">So</a> we start by, you want to propose that we add city council approval to the mayor's-
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=7204.39s">Uh,</a> okay, um, would you be willing just to.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=7259.357s">Again,</a> I feel like if we vote yes on this, I think the Common Center will craft language that would cover those bases. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=7267.14s">Anthony,</a> is that okay? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=7270.461s">Okay,</a> so we're voting on adding city council approval to the mayor's waiver on no person being able to hold more than one city office or position. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=7286.367s">And</a> the city council approval would be a simple majority.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=7313.015s">30</a> days. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=7314.336s">Within</a> 30 days. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=7315.876s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=7333.193s">We</a> got it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=7333.874s">We</a> want to say with the same process that they would approve a multi-member board person. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=7339.617s">Is</a> that what you're saying?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=7342.999s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=7344.179s">Ron.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=7351.146s">Anthony</a> Andreottola.

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=7521.296s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=7522.297s">Thank</a> you for that, Eunice. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=7523.818s">So</a> that's all I got. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=7525.519s">The</a> leading city clerk from 9-11. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=7529.348s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=7531.789s">Anybody</a> else have anything else for Article 9? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=7537.893s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=7539.214s">Paulette,</a> welcome. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=7540.875s">Thanks</a> for joining us.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=7556.347s">We've</a> just finished up basically. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=7557.507s">Then</a> we'll go back and ask you if you have any amendments to any section. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=7567.89s">But</a> before we do that, I just want to check in and make sure everybody saw the language that was added about the financial statements and that the message that I sent you from the call center and see if anybody had any comments or.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=7586.583s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=7633.614s">Okay,</a> everybody else good with that section.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=7969.13s">No,</a> not officially. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=7973.892s">Maury</a> talked to some former elected officials. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=7978.154s">Correct,</a> Maury?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8013.093s">It's</a> just coming up because we just got the language. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8016.676s">We</a> haven't met since, so we wanted to make sure everybody was okay with the language and with the language came this note that I shared. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8024.963s">I</a> just wanted to check in and see if people had any thoughts or comments about that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8033.036s">Okay,</a> so we're good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8036.077s">Okay,</a> so now Paulette, is there something you wanted to revisit?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8056.643s">We</a> don't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8059.604s">I</a> don't think we have to vote on it unless
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8066.595s">We</a> voted to include it and the call and center created wrote it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8073.06s">We</a> voted to include it, and then the Collins Center created the language. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8077.363s">Just</a> as the whole charter has partially been created by us and partially by the Collins Center, so the process tonight is to go through all that language and see if anybody has any proposals for changes.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8096.036s">Okay,</a> so you're proposing removing the- The language <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8101.694s">for</a> the financial reporting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8104.416s">You</a> want to remove that whole thing from the charter.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8108.939s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8109.339s">I</a> don't have the section number in front of me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8111.261s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8112.502s">What</a> is it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8114.763s">Off</a> the top of their head. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8116.304s">It's</a> okay.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8118.226s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8121.288s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8121.908s">So</a> Anthony wants to vote on removing section 918 from the charter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8126.672s">Does</a> everybody understand what that would be?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8176.671s">Well,</a> he's proposing an amendment to the charter, which is to remove Section 9, which, you know, is so. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8187.858s">OK,</a> so does everyone understand what they'll be voting on?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8194.423s">Did</a> someone say no?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8197.325s">Okay,</a> Paulette, section 918 is the language that we bought that lays out the creation of an ethics commission to create a financial reporting form. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8210.071s">So</a> the amendment that's being proposed is to remove that entire section from the chart. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8215.614s">Oh,</a> okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8218.835s">Okay,</a> Danielle. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8223.097s">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8225.939s">Ron.</a>

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8250.231s">I'll</a> vote yes too, but it stays. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8254.253s">Okay,</a> so now,
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8312.183s">Well,</a> I mean, we didn't vote to change the language that's in the proposed chart. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8320.03s">So</a> I guess that means we went along with the recommendation because
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8479.11s">Anthony</a> or Marilyn, do you want to respond to that?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8592.648s">Okay,</a> I guess I don't see it as inaccurate because to me taking it doesn't mean that it can't, that the school committee can't still continue with that process if they want. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8605.86s">But</a> putting it in means that they can never change it until the charter is changed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8613.625s">That's</a> how that's kind of how I see it.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8665.184s">OK,</a> Jean, did you want to say something?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8921.95s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8922.911s">So</a> are you proposing, do you want to make a proposal that we add it back in?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8927.515s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8928.616s">First,</a> I just want to hear what Ron and Eunice and David have some comments. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=8933.54s">Ron?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=9005.434s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=9005.794s">So</a> that's a different issue. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=9007.175s">But</a> let's stick to this issue of the secretary's job description. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=9014.259s">Eunice?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=9070.92s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=9071.9s">Actually,</a> I'm not sure I can do that because it's not in the draft charter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=9076.462s">So</a> I'm just going to read it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=9078.942s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=9080.463s">So</a> we're voting to add in this language. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=9084.504s">In</a> addition, the secretary is responsible for overseeing and approving the bills of the school department unless the school committee votes to form a subcommittee expressly for reviewing the bills. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=9098.626s">That</a> would be the section that we would add back in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=9104.028s">Jean.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=9105.228s">I</a> second. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=9109.45s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=9109.85s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=9110.53s">Jean.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=9111.911s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=9114.051s">Maury.</a>

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=9244.519s">I</a> sent a draft, yeah, so that you guys could sort of take a look at it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=9248.761s">But</a> you'll get a more final draft.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=9256.107s">You'll</a> get a more final draft. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=9260.29s">And</a> then we have one more meeting, and we'll be good to go.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=9270.946s">All</a> right, so we're good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-09-05-24&start=9273.007s">Everybody,</a> we managed to finish before 9.30.

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=830.387s">It</a> would be great to hear from the Collins Center on this.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=896.13s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=898.152s">And</a> what about Ron's question about mass general laws?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1038.067s">Okay,</a> any other questions? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1045.727s">Then</a> I want to take it to a vote, but first, I'm going to ask if there's any members of the public that would like to speak on this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1060.512s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1061.232s">We're</a> going to start by just voting on whether this is something that we would want to include in the chart. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1076.102s">So</a> the vote is, do we put a provision in the charter that would require the city council to pass an ordinance that would require financial statements, annual financial statements from elected officials, candidates, and some city officials?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1101.453s">Oh,</a> I'm sorry.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1103.374s">I</a> was on mute. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1103.894s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1334.738s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1335.879s">I</a> would like to just throw out a question to the Collins Center. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1340.162s">The</a> issues that were just being described about, say, an elected official pushing something because they had an interest in a development company or a liquor store or whatever, those are already prohibited by state law. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1354.533s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1357.635s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1358.076s">I</a> just want that to be clear.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1386.839s">Thank</a> you, David. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1387.559s">I</a> just wanted to clarify that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1398.949s">Because</a> they don't, they're prohibited by law from doing that, but they're not required, local officials are not required to submit annual financial reports, so maybe they could try to get away with it, I guess is the... And I'm going to have to apologize because I cut into Paulette's time.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1416.333s">That's</a> okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1416.873s">Paulette,</a> go ahead.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1420.934s">You're</a> on mute, Paulette.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1557.178s">We</a> would be putting a requirement that they pass an ordinance which could say that the state form is used. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1566.203s">I</a> believe that's what Framingham said. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1568.744s">But</a> it doesn't seem like we want to do that based on this discussion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1573.587s">Maury.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1634.096s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1635.336s">All</a> right, I want to move, I think we have David.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1661.635s">Yeah,</a> we're going to vote right now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1663.056s">Is</a> there anybody in the public that wants to speak? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1669.158s">I'll</a> ask again. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1670.339s">Is</a> there any member of the public that would like to speak? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1676.143s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1677.424s">J.M.N.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1677.984s">made</a> a comment, liquor store is a bad example. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1680.346s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1683.108s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1683.969s">So</a> the vote is that should we put a provision in the charter that would require the city council to create an ordinance to require elected officials, candidates for elected offices, and some city officials to file annual financial statements? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1703.521s">Oh,</a> sorry, it looks like Jim wants to make a comment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1708.165s">Yeah,</a> I think she may want to speak. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1711.447s">And</a> then we will know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1716.871s">Can</a> you unmute now? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1724.337s">Gene,</a> can you unmute yourself? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1730.181s">I'm</a> not sure why she can't.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1739.252s">I'm</a> not sure why. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1748.516s">I'm</a> clicking ask to unmute, but I can't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1752.317s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1754.878s">You</a> should be able to unmute yourself. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1757.84s">Are</a> you not able to?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1764.401s">No,</a> the security settings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1766.744s">I'm</a> clicking and it won't let me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1768.285s">I'm</a> not sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1771.189s">All</a> right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1772.971s">I</a> will try one more thing.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1776.455s">I</a> will try one more thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1781.44s">Can</a> you do it now?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1800.578s">Okay,</a> I guess we can't get it done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1804.26s">If</a> you're able to unmute, let us know, but the comments are currently this is self-regulated, and I assume that means that the electeds are self-regulating themselves in terms of complying with the state law, the conflict of interest law. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1822.108s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1906.378s">Okay,</a> so I want to go ahead with the vote. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1909.201s">I</a> just, Jean, JMN was unable to unmute, but she's making a point that this would create more transparency and that currently elected officials are in charge of, it's sort of an honor system. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1924.054s">Okay,</a> and this vote is simply whether we want to put a provision in the charter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1930.68s">We</a> will not write the ordinance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1933.481s">The</a> city council will write the ordinance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1935.102s">We</a> can direct it to a certain extent, but we can't micromanage it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1938.683s">So</a> this is to put a provision in the charter for the city council to pass an ordinance to require financial statements annually from candidates, elected officials, and some city officials. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1953.129s">So</a> if you vote yes, you're in favor of that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1956.23s">All</a> right, Danielle. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1958.191s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1963.273s">Maury?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1966.415s">Anthony?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1969.737s">Jean?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1971.278s">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1972.94s">Paulette?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1976.962s">You're</a> on mute, Paulette. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1980.885s">You</a> say yes, okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1982.786s">Eunice?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1991.607s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=1996.368s">Ron?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2000.769s">David?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2004.27s">David,</a> you're on mute. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2006.01s">Oh,</a> you can't unmute? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2007.93s">You're</a> yes? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2008.471s">No,</a> I'm unmuted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2009.751s">And</a> you're yes? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2010.951s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2013.892s">And</a> I'm the last one, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2017.976s">I'm</a> just, I'm going to vote no, because I, I just think, I think it's a lot to put into the charter, but it passes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2027.699s">So,</a> uh, cause we had five yes or no and one abstain. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2031.3s">So,</a> um, the next step we are going to, we're going to have to figure out the cats and we're going to ask the call center to help us with that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2040.382s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2043.049s">The</a> other question that we had is whether to create an ethics commission, whether the ordinance should create an ethics commission that would implement this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2054.02s">Anthony</a> Wilson, you had a comment.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2074.721s">No,</a> it was just voted to put it into the charter.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2080.427s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2085.952s">I</a> guess the details of it are gonna have to be decided. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2095.038s">I</a> think maybe what we'll, we're going to have to do is have a subcommittee meeting again and then bring back specific language recommendation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2105.324s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2131.833s">The</a> vote in June was to form the subcommittee.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2150.365s">I</a> know, but I as the chair, I decided to go ahead with it because I felt like there was enough interest in it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2157.347s">So,</a> so that's what we're going to do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2159.568s">The</a> subcommittee is going to come up with some text and we'll bring it back to the committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2163.289s">It</a> will not be a big piece of text to add to our draft charter, which we currently have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2168.231s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2170.03s">All</a> right, so the next item on the agenda is, before we get into the meat of the text of the draft charter, there was a question about the Compensation Advisory Board and the Collins. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2183.708s">Everybody</a> read the draft charter and the memo from the Collins Center?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2189.11s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2190.17s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2191.772s">So</a> I think we can just go ahead to a vote, which is do we, the drafted section 918, which was put in the memo, not in our draft charter, do we want to include that in our charter or do we want to, the question is, do we want to include that in our charter or do we just want to make a recommendation in the final report that the city council pass an ordinance to create a compensation advisory board? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2218.185s">Does</a> everybody understand what we're voting on?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2221.507s">Okay,</a> so a yes vote. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2224.288s">Go</a> ahead.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2229.29s">Yes,</a> we did, but when the Collins Center put together a draft charter, they are pulling that out and making a recommendation that we consider not including it in the charter and rather recommending that the city council write an ordinance to do it.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2292.542s">Just</a> to be clear, the citizen-led board can't determine salaries, they can just make recommendations. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2297.407s">The</a> elected officials will make the decisions.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2359.829s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2361.869s">Okay,</a> so should we have any members of the public that want to speak on this before we vote? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2372.418s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2373.279s">Go</a> ahead, Paula.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2468.155s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2468.895s">So</a> we're going to vote. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2473.238s">If</a> you vote yes, it means you would like to include this in the charter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2477.16s">If</a> you vote no, it means you don't want it in the charter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2480.422s">And</a> we will recommend that the city council create an ordinance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2483.384s">Because</a> we did discuss this in the past, and people did want to do this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2487.786s">So</a> I think the issue <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2490.979s">And</a> maybe the Collins Center can speak to this, but the Collins Center felt that it just didn't, it's not a standard charter item and it didn't rise to the level of the charter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2500.013s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2505.93s">Okay,</a> so on that, with that, let's vote, Danielle. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2511.232s">Yes</a> means you want to put it, you want to put the requirement that this board has created in the charter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2516.893s">No</a> means we want it, but we're going to recommend that the city council pass an ordinance decree.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2532.098s">Anybody</a> want to speak from the public? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2537.146s">I</a> don't see it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2539.567s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2540.907s">So</a> do we understand what the yes and the no? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2543.788s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2544.228s">Danielle?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2546.709s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2547.549s">Maury?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2553.991s">Thanks,</a> Phyllis. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2555.172s">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2556.252s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2557.613s">Anthony?</a>

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2568.215s">Phyllis.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2572.816s">David.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2575.897s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2578.437s">I</a> feel like I missed somebody.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2583.139s">Ron,</a> thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2584.359s">Ron</a> says no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2586.2s">What</a> does Milda say? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2587.8s">I'm</a> going to say no and we'll recommend the ordinance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2592.161s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2592.601s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2595.36s">That</a> will be put into the final report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2598.002s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2598.902s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2599.562s">Now</a> we're going to move on to the draft charter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2602.184s">And</a> I ask that you all read it and come with amendments. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2609.368s">Jean?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2619.653s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2620.394s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2620.714s">We'll</a> figure it out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2622.115s">We'll</a> figure it out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2622.955s">All</a> right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2625.249s">Okay,</a> so does anybody, I have a few things, but I'll ask people first. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2629.992s">Do</a> you have any amendments that you want to make in this draft charter, Paulette?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2654.528s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2656.271s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2656.691s">Thank</a> you, Eunice. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2657.953s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2659.255s">Let's</a> do it article by article. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2660.617s">That's</a> what I meant to do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2661.558s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2689.345s">Okay,</a> so that would be the language that would be added. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2692.67s">Can</a> the call-in center weigh in on, because you didn't suggest that in the draft, so can you speak to that?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2739.409s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2741.651s">Frank</a> or Marilyn, is there any thoughts about it or anything that there's no reason not to include it or is there a reason that it's generally not included?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2829.069s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2832.771s">Okay,</a> so are the raised hands about this particular issue? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2839.36s">No,</a> OK. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2840.981s">So,</a> Paulette, can you just read the language that you want to add so I can get it down?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2855.706s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2864.21s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2870.053s">I</a> mean, you know, that's fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2872.174s">It's</a> very vague to me, but you know, because it doesn't mean anything. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2878.716s">You</a> just want them to be included.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2904.291s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2905.171s">So</a> let's note now, the vote is to include language, to include an elected school committee will oversee Medford's public schools or similar language, because maybe the call-in center will help us tweak it a little bit, to section 1.3. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2923.922s">So</a> if you vote yes, then you want to add it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2928.345s">If</a> not, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2930.03s">If</a> you vote no, you don't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2931.331s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2932.952s">David?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2940.998s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2941.819s">Gene?</a>

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2967.506s">Paulette.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2968.506s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2970.488s">Eunice.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2971.568s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2973.87s">Phyllis.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2975.05s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2977.812s">One</a> more person, Ron.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2982.095s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2984.81s">No,</a> just because I don't think it's necessary, but it's going to be editing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2988.993s">So</a> that's great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2989.994s">That's</a> one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=2991.995s">Does</a> anybody have any other amendments for Article 1?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3155.702s">Are</a> you thinking, Jean, about the confirmation?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3307.449s">But</a> the charter only addresses mayoral appointments, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3311.911s">So</a> would it cover whatever appointments are made by the mayor?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3327.337s">Okay,</a> awesome. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3329.698s">Okay,</a> so any other amendments to section one? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3332.579s">Okay,</a> how about section two? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3339.102s">Phyllis?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3410.107s">It's</a> section 210.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3422.19s">Okay,</a> while you're doing that, Jean?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3438.427s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3443.089s">Anthony</a> or Frank or Marilyn, do charters generally define the difference between a vacancy and a temporary absence?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3455.275s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3460.457s">I</a> believe we did for the mayor.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3487.69s">The</a> city council does.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3524.302s">Anthony,</a> or do you do you have any thoughts on this? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3527.144s">Anthony</a> Wilson.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3641.563s">So</a> we're looking at section 27, and you want to add language? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3649.593s">that</a> the clerk may be removed by a vote of the city council.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3677.623s">There's</a> not any other, I mean, right now all we say about staff is that city council may hire staff subject to appropriation.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3697.42s">I</a> mean, the thing is, we don't say how they're going to hire staff, but we don't say that they hire staff by a vote of the city council. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3704.562s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3705.262s">We</a> just say they so. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3706.503s">I</a> don't know, I see I see a little bit of a difference, but I do too.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3718.045s">Go</a> ahead, Jean. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3718.645s">What</a> were you going to say?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3728.837s">You</a> know what I'm saying? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3730.437s">Well,</a> I mean, they're hiring the staff, so we're not saying how they... Oh, you mean the clerk? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3739.042s">Just</a> the clerk.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3836.932s">Should</a> we say two-thirds, because that's pretty much the standard? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3840.734s">Or</a> you want to say three-quarters?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3858.399s">Two-thirds.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3859.019s">Two-thirds</a> is the standard.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3866.282s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3867.645s">So,</a> um, so on the table is ab language. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3873.188s">Um,</a> the clerk may be removed for cause by a two thirds vote of the city council and then potentially adding something about provide, you know, that, that this provision will not conflict with state law.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3891.587s">Okay,</a> so that's the vote. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3893.468s">If</a> you want to add that, yes.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3903.932s">Yeah,</a> that's true.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3907.753s">You're</a> right, but we should still look at it because if it does conflict, we might want to reconsider adding it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3915.825s">Okay,</a> so yes means yes at it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3919.969s">Eunice?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3921.129s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3923.071s">Paulette?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3923.932s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3925.533s">Phyllis?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3926.614s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3929.076s">Anthony?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3930.257s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3932.558s">Gene?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3933.599s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3935.841s">Danielle?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3937.142s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3939.064s">Ron?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3942.586s">Maury?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3944.268s">David?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3947.851s">All</a> right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3948.351s">I'll</a> be the lone no vote, just because it's not in any charter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3954.115s">So</a> OK, I will be added. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3959.058s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3959.698s">Any</a> other? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3960.578s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3961.639s">Our</a> hands up for section two.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3964.524s">Okay,</a> Paulette.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3977.494s">Yeah,</a> that was mine, Paulette, too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=3979.416s">Oh,</a> that's a typo, and that's gonna be Dink Harrop.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4089.493s">Does</a> that answer your question, Paulette?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4114.785s">Ron,</a> you got muted, okay.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4168.259s">Well,</a> but Paulette, your question is, it says no ordinance shall be passed finally, blah, blah, blah, except in the case of an emergency or in the case of the unanimous vote of the city council. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4182.644s">So</a> your question is, is the unanimous vote of the city council include ordinances that aren't emergency ordinances? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4190.107s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4193.388s">To</a> me, it reads yes, that it does. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4196.138s">But</a> I don't know, maybe I'm reading it.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4227.137s">So</a> that was your question, Paulette, so you're good with that?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4236.661s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4286.144s">Your</a> question is if the wards increase, then will the at-large Councilors decrease?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4325.676s">Anthony,</a> Frank, or Marilyn?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4465.445s">Is</a> that part of the city council or was it just- No, that wasn't part of the city council discussion.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4475.509s">Well,</a> if you want to propose that we've changed the language, you can. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4479.671s">So</a> let me see what we-
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4526.821s">It's</a> on page 13, which... It also, the school committee also has an extra role besides, it has vice president and secretary, I believe.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4543.742s">And</a> I, you know, I think that the roles are different to me, but if you want to make it, if you want to make it, if you want to propose an amendment that we change that language in city, in the city council. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4558.266s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4558.886s">I'm</a> just trying to find. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4560.786s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4563.647s">While</a> you look for that, is anybody else have a chance to have anything for article two? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4571.427s">Okay,</a> I have one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4573.808s">I</a> would like to on Article Section 2.1 in Article 2, under eligibility, because we're requiring a residency requirement for ward school Councilors, I would like to add a ward candidate for city council shall at the time of election be a Medford voter and shall have resided in the ward for which they're seeking office for one year prior to inauguration. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4601.265s">I</a> said that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4602.746s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4603.867s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4604.548s">So</a> let's vote on that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4610.672s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4618.49s">I</a> add the language to section to one eligibility for City Council. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4623.073s">A</a> ward candidate for City Council shall at the time of election be a method voter and shall have resided in the ward for which they're seeking office for one year prior to inauguration. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4633.239s">So</a> that would be an addition. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4635.641s">Um,</a> okay, David. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4637.802s">I'm</a> not. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4643.065s">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4643.446s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4644.887s">Um,</a> Maury. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4649.735s">I</a> don't know, he might be away, I'll get back to him. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4651.596s">Gene?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4654.557s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4656.598s">That's</a> okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4657.358s">You're</a> yes, Maury?

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4840.067s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4841.388s">That's</a> what's on the table.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4905.423s">Okay,</a> are we ready to vote on this for the city council?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4957.682s">Okay,</a> and I actually agree with Ron. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4960.444s">I</a> feel, because there's also even outlined in the charter certain powers of the president of the city council, I just think it is a different role. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4968.991s">But</a> we will vote on adding language to the section 2-2 that the city council president and vice president will serve for one year and be rotating positions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4986.035s">It</a> would be more elegant than that, but that's the gist of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4989.618s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4989.998s">Eunice.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4991.179s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4992.74s">Paulette.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=4996.503s">Anthony</a> Andrea.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5000.145s">Phyllis.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5002.747s">Ron.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5005.549s">Danielle.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5007.791s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5010.073s">Gene.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5011.074s">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5014.336s">Maury.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5017.495s">David,</a> no, and I'm also not. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5022.157s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5022.737s">So</a> we won't make that change.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5052.453s">You</a> mean the vacancy?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5054.814s">Because</a> the original seat does.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5097.737s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5098.077s">But</a> you're talking about in the case of the city council needing to fill the vacancy, meaning that none of the people that ran are eligible to serve. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5106.059s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5109.265s">I</a> don't see that it does specify that, but it is a temporary appointment.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5132.157s">You</a> want to add that to section? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5135.329s">I</a> think it's section 10 under C. Yeah.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5160.027s">So,</a> you just want to add language that any person appointed to fill a ward Councilor's vacancy of a ward Councilor must reside in the ward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5170.291s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5172.772s">Collin</a> Center, does that make sense or is there any reason not to do that that we're not aware of?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5214.545s">No,</a> I don't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5217.967s">I'm</a> sorry, could you say that again?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5246.491s">That's</a> a good question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5247.812s">Let's</a> see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5252.523s">Eligible</a> and willing is under B. That's for the people who ran, I think. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5259.028s">We're</a> talking about adding it under C. This is only for when the city council has to appoint someone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5266.013s">So</a> the amendment on the table is that we add language to section 210C that any vacancy that has to be filled by an appointment of the city council, any vacancy in a ward Councilor that has to be filled by an appointment of the city council must be a person who resides in that ward.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5288.387s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5288.848s">I</a> have a question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5290.869s">Phyllis.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5337.112s">That</a> makes sense to me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5338.153s">Thank</a> you for clarifying that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5369.979s">Um,</a> okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5372.473s">Maury,</a> did you have a comment about this?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5426.723s">So</a> can I just, Maury, I think what Maury is saying is we should say that there's a special election if there's a vacancy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5433.145s">Is</a> that what you're saying?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5435.405s">So</a> I want to first vote on the language that Eunice proposed about saying that we add language to section 210C that the appointed person reside in the ward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5447.169s">And</a> then we'll get to the special election. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5449.591s">Okay,</a> so sound good.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5454.736s">I</a> know they are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5455.496s">I</a> know they are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5456.517s">But,</a> um, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5458.583s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5459.363s">I</a> mean, the special election would be a whole addition. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5461.985s">We</a> don't have anything. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5463.025s">We</a> don't say that there's going to be special elections for city council right now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5466.567s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5467.648s">So</a> we would be changing quite a bit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5470.929s">But</a> we'd still have section B, right, where the next vote getter would- So what the proposal, I think, would be is to get rid of C entirely and not have the city council appoint in the case where one of the people who ran can't take the seat. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5487.939s">Okay,</a> so is that, and maybe the Collins Center has some thoughts about special elections for vacant city council seats.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5578.5s">Okay,</a> so I think from what I understood what you just said that we do still have to vote on the language about because there could be a situation where there would be an appointment, even if we decided on a special election, because the special election would only happen during a particular timeframe.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5599.446s">Right,</a> right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5600.127s">No,</a> it makes sense. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5601.227s">We</a> did for mayor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5602.808s">So</a> let's vote first on the language about the appointed person residing in the ward, and then we'll look at whether we want to add special election, okay? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5613.214s">All</a> right, so section 210C, add language that award vacancy appointed by the city council, the person must reside in the ward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5624.978s">Uh,</a> Eunice? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5627.139s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5628.859s">Uh,</a> Anthony Andrea?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5632.3s">Uh,</a> Paulette? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5633.36s">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5634.86s">Uh,</a> Phyllis?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5637.181s">Danielle?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5640.102s">Jean?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5641.222s">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5643.403s">Uh,</a> Ron?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5646.723s">Um,</a> Lori?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5650.504s">Uh,</a> David?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5654.652s">And</a> I'm going to vote no for the reasons that Daveed outlined. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5658.454s">Okay,</a> so we're not adding that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5660.835s">Now,</a> in terms of the special election, we would have to come up with the language for it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5667.678s">Eunice,</a> did you want to make the comment? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5670.119s">Is</a> your hand up for... Oh, no, sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5674.296s">We</a> do have language for under the mayor section, but let's just vote on whether we want to add a special election into this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5683.023s">And</a> then if the vote is no, then we don't have to worry about figuring out timelines. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5688.428s">So</a> we'll vote on, do we want to fill vacancies in the city council if there's nobody from the election who can take the seat? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5700.406s">do</a> we want to put a provision in the charter for a special election for city council?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5712.456s">No,</a> I don't think so.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5716.98s">We're</a> eliminating the city council potentially leaving that in depending on what timeline we would decide for the special election. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5724.946s">Does</a> that make sense?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5746.417s">So</a> are you suggesting that only award Councilor get replaced with a special election?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5752.461s">But</a> that's what we were talking about in the last vote. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5756.343s">So</a> do you mean only award Councilor? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5758.624s">No,</a> I'm open to either or. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5762.047s">Or</a> both. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5763.227s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5764.668s">Phyllis.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5781.131s">Right</a> now, the seat is vacant. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5783.933s">The</a> person who got the next highest votes takes it down the line. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5787.116s">If</a> that fails, the city council appoints. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5792.58s">The</a> proposal on the table is that if that fails, if nobody who ran can take the seat, we have a special election.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5809.69s">Well,</a> right now there's no special election written in, and right now the city council makes the appointment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5815.431s">Right,</a> but my final question is- But you're saying if there's a special election and nobody runs, then what do we do?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5837.893s">That</a> would be decided in, if we decide on a special election, we would then decide what timelines we would put in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5844.72s">So</a> we would say in the charter, if it's X number of days or months before a regular city election, then we don't have a special.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5908.223s">So</a> you're still putting your proposal for a special election out there, Maury? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5912.229s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5912.57s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5914.052s">Ron</a> and Gene, did you have comments?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5957.525s">I</a> would like to just vote on whether we want to put in special elections for city council in the case of someone who ran not being able to take the seat before. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5966.672s">Then</a> if we say yes, we can decide the details. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5971.708s">Is</a> that okay? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5972.449s">Does</a> that sound okay?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5980.833s">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5981.673s">Right</a> now we have the city council appointing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5984.375s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5987.416s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5987.876s">So</a> special elections for city council under the circumstances we discussed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5994.099s">If</a> you're in favor, yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5995.58s">If</a> not, no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=5997.241s">Anthony,</a> Andrea.

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6029.862s">I'm</a> going to also be no, just for the reasons that have been laid out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6035.127s">Okay,</a> so that's that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6039.11s">Anybody</a> have anything else for section two?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6083.623s">Well,</a> we're going to, I mean, we only have 15 minutes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6086.684s">We're</a> probably not going to get to Section 8, so keep that for the next meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6091.384s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6091.924s">Section</a> 3, Article 3, I mean. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6095.345s">Anybody</a> have any changes they want or amendments that they want to propose for Article 3? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6099.166s">Daveed?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6156.6s">Okay,</a> so your proposal is to add that back in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6162.041s">I</a> guess my question for the Collins Center is, when you made the recommendation, was there any legal reason for making that recommendation?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6191.113s">OK,</a> so the proposal on the table is to add back in department heads as possible replace, as possibilities for filling mayoral vacancies. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6208.248s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6210.81s">Does</a> that sound right, David?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6218.916s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6219.936s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6220.037s">So,</a> yes means that you want to add that back in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6224.42s">No</a> means you don't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6228.643s">Ron?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6271.766s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6273.107s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6273.767s">So</a> I'm going to go just the way my Zoom boxes are.

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6304.376s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6305.597s">So</a> the vote is to add back in department heads as possibilities for filling a mayoral vacancy as acting mayor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6316.421s">Uh,</a> Maury.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6319.923s">Uh,</a> Ron.

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6551.491s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6552.351s">So</a> let's do the vote. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6554.811s">We</a> know what we're voting on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6556.332s">I'm</a> going to restart the vote. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6558.092s">Maury?</a>

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6787.291s">I</a> think the veto was already in place.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6821.608s">Yeah,</a> I think so.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6864.547s">I</a> think that's governed by state law.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6904.827s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6905.127s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6905.647s">This</a> provision is related to ordinances, correct? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6909.868s">It</a> says order ordinance resolution. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6912.629s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6914.65s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6915.21s">So</a> I think we got through articles one through three, which is awesome, but we have many more articles to go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6924.711s">Let's</a> come to the next meeting, really think through your amendments and come with them and try to be succinct and we'll get through the rest hopefully at the next meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6935.404s">Because</a> I'm not going to call another meeting between now and September, and hopefully we won't have to call two meetings in September. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6944.555s">So</a> let's look to get through the rest of it at the next meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6947.857s">We</a> also wanted to give a brief report on the final report subcommittee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6952.12s">The</a> final report is in pretty good shape and we are going to share it with you all so you can read it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6958.724s">It's</a> in <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6962.308s">Pieces</a> right now, it's in many Google Docs, but we'll share that with you so you can read it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6967.432s">And</a> then if anybody has any comments about that, we can look at the next meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6971.975s">We</a> would have huge numbers. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6975.737s">Eventually,</a> eventually, eventually it will. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6979.52s">It</a> doesn't yet, but it will eventually.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6986.01s">Yeah,</a> no, I think it will eventually. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6988.931s">Maury,</a> did you have a question?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=6995.514s">Is</a> that what, the first Thursday in September?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=7006.319s">How</a> do people feel about September 5th? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=7009.72s">I'm</a> good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=7010.721s">It's</a> the Thursday after Labor Day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=7014.222s">September</a> 12th would be better.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=7017.968s">I</a> mean, you know, we we sort of have a set schedule and we tell everyone, you know, where. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=7023.298s">I</a> mean, we could change it if a lot of people who cannot come on September 5th.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-08-01-24&start=7037.374s">I</a> think we're going to keep it on September 5th.

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=97.5s">I'm</a> sorry, you would like to be great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=101.064s">So</a> I'll check in with that I sent out a doodle poll and I'll send it to you too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=105.669s">Okay,</a> so the first so we have, I think, maybe the easiest thing to do is to just share the document. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=113.597s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=115.63s">And</a> the first item in Article 9 that we're going to look at is the possible addition of a section on public comment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=124.272s">So</a> Eunice added something from the Fall River Charter, which actually is one of the charters that the Collins Center provided, because when I asked them about this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=132.415s">So</a> I put the feedback from the Collins Center in brown and <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=139.817s">And</a> the reason I left that part in blue, Eunice, is because the Collins Center sent us such examples from other charters, and they did send us Fall River, but they didn't, that part wasn't in what they sent us, so. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=153.163s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=157.325s">So,</a> whoops, sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=159.826s">Make</a> it bigger, too, please. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=162.748s">Yes,</a> I will. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=163.888s">So,</a> have people had a chance to look at these and, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=169.343s">and</a> think about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=173.707s">So</a> basically, the Collins Center said it's not common, but there are charters that do add something about this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=179.651s">And</a> this is specifically about public comment from multi-member boards. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=184.916s">And</a> the Collins Center encourages us to allow multi-member boards to have flexibility around how and when they receive feedback from the public. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=195.504s">So</a> the examples are Fall River, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=199.362s">Do</a> people look at these? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=200.782s">Then</a> we had Amherst and Dedham. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=204.183s">Do</a> people have a chance to look at them? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=206.223s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=212.265s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=212.465s">Because</a> like I said, that wasn't what the call-in center provided, but that was something that Eunice had. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=217.606s">Was</a> that in the Fall River chart? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=219.806s">You</a> broke up a little. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=233.729s">Can</a> anybody understand Eunice?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=236.63s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=393.939s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=394.339s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=395.22s">Maury?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=400.462s">Are</a> you muted? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=401.323s">Yeah,</a> now you're on.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=444.759s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=446.779s">I</a> just want to hear from Paulette first, and then we also have some other people that want to comment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=451.401s">Paulette?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=568.436s">We're</a> going to go to Ron and then David. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=571.619s">Then</a> when all the committee members have spoken, we'll turn to the member of the public, Ron and then David.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=648.453s">Um,</a> okay, thank you.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=723.052s">OK,</a> thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=724.572s">Maury</a> and then Paulette.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=834.736s">Yes,</a> I will read it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=836.358s">The</a> city council, the school committee, and all multiple member bodies shall develop and adopt rules or a policy addressing public comment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=846.386s">The</a> rules or policy shall require that public comment periods appear on meeting agendas for all regular and special meetings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=855.629s">Public</a> comment shall not be limited to items on the agenda for any regular meeting, provided the issues or concerns raised are within the jurisdiction of the city council school committee or any multiple member body respectively. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=868.973s">Public</a> comment at any special meeting shall be limited to items on the meeting agenda. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=875.559s">There</a> is another paragraph, but Eunice, when you were breaking up, I didn't get the answer whether this blue part actually is from the Fall River Charter.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=1001.241s">I'll</a> just read that sentence again. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=1003.243s">Public</a> comment should not be limited to items on the agenda for any regular meeting provided the issues or concerns raised are within the jurisdiction of the body. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=1014.674s">It</a> has to be relevant to the body.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=1062.788s">Thank</a> you, David. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=1063.57s">So</a> we have a bunch of committee members want to speak and I do want to make sure we hear from our member of the public as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=1069.683s">Ron.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=1123.501s">All</a> right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=1125.602s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=1126.043s">Phyllis?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=1251.217s">You're</a> breaking up again a little bit.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=1339.547s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=1342.071s">Okay,</a> more did you have a quick comment and then we're going to go to Matthew.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=1464.669s">Thanks,</a> Maury. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=1465.629s">OK,</a> Matthew.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=1647.953s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=1650.241s">I</a> just want to say my reading of this doesn't limit anything that the actual body talks about, but it limits, it's talking about public comment, but I see what you're saying that it could still be. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=1661.92s">lifted.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=1688.574s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=1802.161s">Okay,</a> thank you, Ron.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2062.693s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2063.754s">Daveed?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2118.339s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2119.841s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2120.701s">So</a> I want to just start to close that we've had a really good discussion, but I want to make sure that we get to everything else on the agenda. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2128.466s">So</a> I want to get final quick comments on this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2132.247s">And</a> then Maury did make a motion to vote on it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2134.929s">So</a> Paulette.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2139.791s">Okay,</a> Maury.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2156.686s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2157.907s">Matthew,</a> did you have another comment? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2159.609s">And</a> I have seconded it.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2184.113s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2184.973s">I</a> will work that in, but I just want to just quickly make sure everybody look at the other two. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2194.062s">This</a> is definitely the Fall River one is the one that people want to vote on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2202.492s">Did</a> everyone look at the other two examples? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2205.635s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2206.456s">The</a> other two examples don't mention city council and school committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2215.09s">So,</a> okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2215.991s">So</a> I don't hear any comments. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2217.512s">So</a> we're going to stick with this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2218.912s">The</a> only thing I want to say, well, I want to say a couple of things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2221.614s">One</a> thing I want to say is I think we, and I don't think this will be a big issue, but we just took us last week. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2229.459s">And</a> one thing I had talked to the call center about was to be careful about using specific language that could box us in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2236.323s">So</a> city website, I think, but we talked about last week that they're going to change that language so that it's, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2244.228s">adaptable</a> to whatever potential form of communication might be around in eight years, say, before the next charter review. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2256.496s">So</a> I'm just going to suggest when we submit it to the Collins Center that they just make that consistent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2263.7s">The</a> only other thing I'm going to throw out, and I don't think it's a big deal because I think the Collins Center will flag it if it really is a conflict, but <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2271.185s">I</a> don't think it is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2272.466s">We</a> did the initiative petition, which lets people put an item on the agenda, and it sort of limits their ability to put the same item on multiple times. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2285.572s">So</a> I don't think it's a conflict, but I'm also not going to worry about it because I think the Collins Center will tell us if it is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2292.755s">Okay,</a> so the motion as I see it on the table is <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2299.388s">to</a> accept the Fall River language with the addition of a clause ensuring that all comments comply with Mass General Law privacy and confidentiality guidelines. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2312.85s">And</a> again, you know, the call-in center will be responsible for adding that and they'll tell us if it's, you know, they'll have a comment about it if they think it's not needed or if whatever. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2325.773s">Anyway,</a> so that's the motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2328.377s">We</a> have a second, so we're going to vote. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2332.138s">Rob.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2335.138s">Eunice.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2335.939s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2337.259s">Phyllis.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2338.779s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2339.699s">Maury.</a>

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2355.103s">Did</a> I get everybody? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2356.483s">Rob.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2358.253s">I</a> got Ron, I think. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2359.333s">Did</a> I get you, Ron?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2362.094s">Yeah,</a> just me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2367.716s">I</a> feel like I'm going to abstain because I feel like I got to think about it more, so I'm abstaining. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2373.137s">I'm</a> copping out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2375.878s">Come</a> on, Milva. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2377.038s">I'm</a> sorry.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2388.947s">It</a> does pass. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2389.748s">The</a> motion passes.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2392.79s">Now,</a> the next item is an addition on conflict of interest. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2401.62s">and</a> a lot of other things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2403.081s">So</a> when I spoke with the Collins Center, they pointed out that this particular section is usually limited to this very simple language. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2412.104s">All</a> city employees shall be considered municipal employees under Chapter 26, 268A of the general laws and shall comply with the state conflict of interest laws. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2421.788s">So</a> while that's standard, there are some communities that add another layer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2427.63s">The</a> reason that most don't is because most of these things are covered in state law. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2434.252s">And</a> they recommend that if we do add another layer and extra provisions, that we should ensure that none of the provisions conflict with state law. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2445.475s">So</a> this is, again, from Fall River, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2448.296s">And</a> it's pretty long. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2451.519s">Did</a> everyone look at it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2454.08s">Actually,</a> should we go part by part? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2456.32s">The</a> first part is the conflict of interest, David.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2508.013s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2510.075s">Anybody</a> else?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2533.188s">One</a> might be the, I think the financial statement, like right now, it's not, I don't think everybody's required to submit a financial statement, I believe. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2544.87s">Are</a> we talking about the ethics part? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2548.371s">Yeah,</a> that's ethics, I guess.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2554.792s">No,</a> no.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2638.34s">Well,</a> just say that just because the Collins Center makes recommendations, but just because they work with the charter, it doesn't mean that they just help. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2651.605s">Um,</a> and they might've said, well, we recommend this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2654.367s">And</a> then the municipality said, well, we're doing this anyway.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2720.205s">I</a> mean, that's what we have to decide is how to deal. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2723.688s">Should</a> we just go one by one and start with the... <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2727.812s">The</a> conflict of interest section, basically, just to be clear, that first section, the letter A section is standard language, and I think that would have just been put into the charter by the Collins Center. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2742.14s">And</a> the other part is in addition, but it's, I mean, you know, most of this is covered in state law. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2755.308s">I</a> wonder if some of that
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2771.47s">There</a> was a big mess there, definitely.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2911.805s">OK,</a> let's start with the conflict of interest section. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=2915.207s">Ron,</a> did you have a comment about that?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3064.091s">Great,</a> thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3066.353s">Okay,</a> Matthew.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3162.775s">Okay,</a> thank you, David.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3177.309s">I</a> think it was.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3351.901s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3353.202s">And</a> now I want to hear from Maury and then we're going to
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3391.721s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3392.823s">So</a> I guess I think that, you know, the charter, we've talked about this in the past, it tends to <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3402.067s">We</a> want it to be meaningful, but we also want to be careful about too many specifics because the charter is set in stone and it's hard to change. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3412.112s">I</a> guess I'm just going to make a motion that we adopt the language under A and not the rest of it under conflict of interest.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3425.599s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3426.26s">If</a> you want to include the rest of it, you vote no, basically. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3431.847s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3433.449s">Maury.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3443.375s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3443.695s">It</a> just says there's conflicts, you know, there's conflict of interest law and you have to follow it basically. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3449.979s">You</a> follow state law.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3461.373s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3461.713s">So</a> it would not include everything else, but we'll do it section by section. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3467.214s">But</a> this is under this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3468.435s">We're</a> only including A. If you agree with that, you vote yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3471.915s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3472.475s">So</a> Maury. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3475.036s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3476.496s">Ron.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3478.817s">David.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3481.317s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3482.897s">Eunice.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3484.118s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3485.958s">Paulette.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3486.998s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3488.759s">Anthony.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3491.545s">Did</a> I get Phyllis? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3493.146s">No,</a> but yes for me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3494.707s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3495.367s">I'm</a> yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3498.408s">That's</a> that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3499.609s">Now,</a> we move on to we've got these other sections, prohibition against self-dealing, and then the ethics reporting requirement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3511.794s">I</a> think that was, and there's another section.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3518.512s">Yeah,</a> but I'm just looking at the conflict of interest stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3522.734s">There's</a> also this section about public contracts. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3526.296s">So</a> this is pretty much, it's included in the conflict of interest section. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3531.339s">So</a> these would be extra layers. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3537.622s">We've</a> had a discussion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3538.703s">Does</a> anybody want to make a motion on any of these?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3640.994s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3641.674s">I</a> mean, this also includes, I think, even more <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3646.468s">division</a> heads, but anyway, so that, so that's that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3652.072s">And</a> that's a very specific requirement that that language is requiring electeds to file, regularly file a financial statement, a statement of financial interest.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3733.222s">City</a> clerk. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3735.043s">City</a> clerk.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3799.24s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3799.44s">How</a> does it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3799.981s">Um,</a> yeah, go ahead. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3802.201s">You</a> know what? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3802.922s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3906.838s">You</a> did remind me of something that the Collins Center said that is that these issues are often covered in ordinances, so they could be covered in it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3918.542s">Ron.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3973.32s">Well,</a> there definitely are, but I think, and that is what the Callen Center conveyed that most of this is covered in state law, but this financial statement, for instance, is another layer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=3991.215s">That's</a> not required in state law that every, you know, whatever elected or every department head or whatever fills out a financial state interest of, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4002.396s">But</a> yeah, you know what I'm saying? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4004.177s">That's</a> hot. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4006.058s">Okay,</a> Maury.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4032.261s">Okay,</a> Eunice.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4185.184s">So</a> we have a couple of motions or ideas on the table. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4188.866s">We</a> have one, form a subcommittee to take a deep dive into this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4193.388s">Two,</a> just not include any of this and just keep the section we have about state law. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4202.933s">And</a> three, include something that this would be decided by ordinance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4207.955s">So</a> I guess if we do make a subcommittee, are we specifically talking about a subcommittee on the ethics reporting requirement, which is essentially the financial statement?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4236.775s">And</a> it could be huge. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4239.137s">And</a> Daveed, like the analogy that you used about, you know, your underwear. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4244.682s">I</a> mean, it is definitely intrusive. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4247.824s">There's</a> no question about it.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4251.147s">It</a> doesn't mean it's not a good idea, but it is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4253.97s">It's</a> pretty big thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4256.592s">Maury.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4267.145s">With</a> forming a subcommittee?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4270.026s">Okay,</a> so just to be clear about, we're still going to go ahead with our plan, which is handing everything to the Collins Center, but we're just going to say that there's still some decisions to be made on ethics reporting requirement, and we'll add in whatever we decide later. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4287.582s">So</a> the motion on the floor is to form a subcommittee to research and ethics reporting requirement in the form of a financial statement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4304.608s">Can</a> I just put it that way?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4309.29s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4312.728s">Yes,</a> that's the limit of the subcommittee, you know, but the language here is actually not limited to elected officials.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4352.28s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4353.381s">That</a> would be, you know, the only people that would... you'd have any legitimate basis for asking for this information.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4382.016s">Well,</a> if we include it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4383.197s">Yeah,</a> I don't know.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4403.715s">Okay,</a> that's fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4404.155s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4404.395s">So</a> the motion is not to have this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4406.637s">It's</a> to have a subcommittee to look at it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4409.619s">Okay,</a> so Eunice. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4411.5s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4413.041s">David.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4416.86s">Maury.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4417.82s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4418.721s">Ron.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4421.803s">Anthony.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4423.104s">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4424.845s">Phyllis.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4426.006s">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4428.387s">Who</a> didn't I get? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4432.71s">Paulette.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4433.651s">Paulette,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4456.862s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4460.544s">I'm</a> voting no, which means it's a tie. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4462.545s">It's</a> a tie and I think tie usually, what does a tie go to? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4471.17s">I</a> should know this.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4475.686s">Well,</a> that's fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4478.187s">But</a> given that there is interest, and there are people there, I assume, are willing to serve on this subcommittee? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4484.81s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4486.21s">I</a> mean, we don't, you know, we're not, we're an ad hoc committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4489.752s">So</a> we're not like required to follow Robert's rules.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4510.171s">This</a> is what would happen on the subcommittee would meet and there would be a deadline of. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4516.876s">Our</a> August meeting and the subcommittee would then. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4521.725s">make</a> a recommendation that we would vote on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4527.147s">I</a> think we would have to limit the discussion because our plan for August is to go through the final charter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4537.571s">This</a> subcommittee would be extremely focused. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4540.332s">It</a> would be just about this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4543.033s">I</a> would have them aim for a very succinct, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4551.222s">Um,</a> Recommendation that just covered the absolutely relevant points that we could then vote on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4557.144s">Does</a> that make sense?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4616.845s">It's</a> not, that's what I'm saying. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4619.367s">It</a> would be like maybe a 10 to 15 minute presentation slash vote at our August meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4628.213s">Can</a> we do that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4629.594s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4630.475s">Okay,</a> who wants to be on the subcommittee?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4634.337s">Okay,</a> so we've got Maury, Eunice. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4639.241s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4640.642s">Did</a> I see Daveed?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4643.684s">And</a> did I see anybody else? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4648.512s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4649.413s">I'll</a> be on it because I'm on every subcommittee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4654.155s">I</a> mean, yeah, I'll just like, you know, okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4657.697s">So</a> who, um, does anybody want to be in charge of setting up a meeting for that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4664.681s">I</a> can do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4665.302s">I</a> can do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4668.563s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4669.004s">So</a> Eunice, you'll, Eunice will send out dates to set up a meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4674.487s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4676.408s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4679.589s">That's</a> basically that section about financial interest. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4684.793s">The</a> last piece is, are you counting the WALFAM section as part of the?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4709.591s">That's</a> part of state law. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4714.615s">So</a> far, just to be clear from this section, under the conflict of interest, we're including the standard language which just says that about municipal employees and that they're beholden to follow mass general laws. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4731.527s">And</a> then we are going to have a subcommittee look at the possible extra layer of financial statements. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4738.693s">That's</a> my understanding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4739.974s">Okay,</a> good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4742.175s">Now,</a> the property. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4745.098s">Eunice,</a> do you want to just give some background about what you're thinking about on this?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4902.59s">Well,</a> the school committee, you're saying comes from state law, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4907.671s">I</a> think so, Paulette.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4910.532s">100</a> percent is state law. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4913.793s">My</a> feeling about this is that this is the kind of thing that could be in an ordinance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4918.834s">In</a> what? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4919.695s">In</a> an ordinance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4923.4s">But</a> I don't know how others feel.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=4955.545s">Anybody</a> have any other thoughts about this naming of city property?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5027.072s">So</a> do we, does anybody want to make a motion about this? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5030.275s">Are</a> we, I mean, we've had some discussion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5038.187s">Does</a> anybody feel strongly about including it and they want to make a motion or.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5139.875s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5143.462s">So</a> you want, okay, so you want to make a motion to exclude this section?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5148.246s">Somebody</a> want to second? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5152.529s">I'll</a> second it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5153.43s">How's</a> that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5154.411s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5156.733s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5157.313s">Anthony?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5159.815s">Ron?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5162.637s">Maury?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5166.941s">Daveed?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5169.483s">Phyllis?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5170.503s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5171.965s">Paulette?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5172.886s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5175.969s">I</a> think that's it and I'm voting.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5184.216s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5185.417s">We're</a> going to move on now to the purchase or taking of land. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5195.325s">Do</a> you want to talk about why you think this is a good idea for the charter?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5264.679s">One</a> thing, I think this was the language that I gave to the Collins Center and they actually had an issue with it because of the language which is outlined in these comments. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5280.403s">They</a> also gave these examples. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5282.365s">And</a> one of the things that I thought is interesting to note is that we actually, it's in Mass General Law for Planned Parenthood, so we technically have this provision. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5290.509s">And</a> so I feel, you know, there's definitely Mass General Law about this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5296.972s">So.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5297.853s">What</a> about eminent domain? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5299.434s">Does</a> that apply here for anything? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5303.396s">I</a> think it does.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5366.799s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5368.039s">Anybody</a> else? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5370.281s">I'm</a> good with that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5382.644s">So</a> basically, the motion is that we do not include a section about taking of land by city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5393.23s">That's</a> essentially it, right?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5398.053s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5401.834s">Okay,</a> Anthony?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5407.037s">David?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5410.019s">Eunice?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5411.179s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5412.02s">Ron?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5414.081s">Maury?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5417.043s">Phyllis?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5417.944s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5418.944s">Paulette?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5419.825s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5420.986s">And</a> I'll go yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5422.006s">Okay,</a> awesome. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5424.121s">Okay,</a> so those were the outstanding issues on the list. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5430.807s">Does</a> anybody have any other outstanding issues that we need? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5434.069s">I</a> mean, we do have one, which is the financial statements, but does anybody have any other outstanding issues that we should look at before we are ready to hand things over to the call center?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5471.443s">I'm</a> not sure, I'm not, I mean, you know, we already went through that and we voted on that section. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5477.226s">So</a> whatever we got was brought up in a meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5479.907s">If</a> it wasn't brought up in a meeting, we didn't get it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5482.608s">Maybe</a> I'm just misremembering. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5486.35s">But</a> just remember, I mean, we are gonna get a draft charter from the Collins Center and we're all gonna have the opportunity to read it and then we're all gonna discuss it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5495.534s">So</a> this is, you know, there's, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5500.055s">there's</a> going to be chances to discuss things that come up for you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5504.837s">That's</a> all I'm saying. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5506.238s">David?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5511.82s">Oh,</a> thanks, David. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5514.542s">All</a> right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5515.142s">Awesome.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5523.807s">OK,</a> so I'm just going to take a moment to talk about the final report committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5531.63s">It's</a> Jean, Maury, me, Phyllis, potentially, and Daveed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5536.532s">So</a> I did have a doodle poll, and I'll just tell you the three times that work for Phyllis and you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5543.595s">I'm</a> basically checking with Phyllis and Daveed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5547.136s">June</a> 25th, which is this Tuesday, or June 26th from 2.30 to 4.00. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5554.1s">And</a> I don't know if day ever works for you, Phyllis.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5574.091s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5574.971s">What</a> about you, David? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5575.932s">Are</a> daytimes out for you?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5581.99s">Okay,</a> so I'm going to I'm actually going to schedule that I'll send out an agenda. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5586.172s">I</a> mean, our first meeting is going to basically be just to make a plan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5591.594s">About</a> is that going to be Melba Wednesday from 230 to 4. so if you can't come. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5597.758s">You</a> think you can come? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5598.719s">I'm</a> going to try to make sure I don't have anything scheduled for them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5601.722s">The</a> other date that was available was Sunday the 30th from 630 to 8. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5607.147s">So,</a> all right, so we'll do Wednesday the 26th from 234 and then we'll see where we go from there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5615.055s">I</a> mean, basically, we're going to be making a plan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5616.916s">We're</a> going to be. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5618.926s">figuring</a> out sort of how we're going to structure it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5622.548s">Maybe</a> people will volunteer to write certain sections. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5624.929s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5625.269s">We'll</a> figure it out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5626.109s">But</a> that's what our meeting is going to be about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5628.69s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5632.632s">And</a> as I said, we're not meeting in July. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5635.053s">And</a> we will meet the first Thursday in August. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5639.535s">I</a> don't have the date handy, but it's our usual. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5642.756s">And</a> you will have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5645.215s">assuming</a> the call-in center is turnaround is as quick as they told me it is, you will all have had some time with the draft charter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5654.098s">So</a> that will be your July homework to read the draft charter and come prepared to go over it with the call-in center in August. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5664.621s">And</a> hopefully, we'll have a good start on a final report.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5667.902s">Sounds</a> like a plan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5668.522s">The</a> first Thursday in August is August 1st. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5672.144s">It</a> is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5672.904s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5674.604s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5677.747s">Next</a> meeting, August 1st, with the Collins Center. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5683.072s">And</a> if for some reason they can't come, I'll let you know, but I don't think that's gonna happen. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5687.496s">All</a> right, Matthew, you have comments?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5719.655s">Yes,</a> that is Article 8. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5722.256s">And</a> there's a lot in that article, initiative petitions, all kinds of things, recalls, et cetera. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5733.582s">But</a> yeah, I can send you what we have that we voted on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5738.165s">And</a> again, so we have several articles that we have drafted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5743.487s">Those</a> are all going to go to the Collins Center. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5745.228s">So</a> what the Collins Center will be doing is just sort of <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5751.303s">looking</a> for consistency of language. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5753.824s">We</a> kept talking about when it says certain number of days, what does that mean? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5757.246s">Well,</a> there's going to be that whole definition section, so that'll be what they're going to do for us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5763.509s">Then</a> they're going to actually draft Articles 5, 9, and 10, but we actually did vote on some of the language in Article 9, but they'll plug in whatever standard language. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5779.536s">So</a> they'll be looking for consistency of language. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5782.857s">If</a> they have questions about what we meant, they'll ask us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5786.237s">If</a> they see something that they think will maybe cause an issue, they'll tell us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5790.598s">Like,</a> for instance, we didn't end up voting on using that language from WALF-AM about the taking of land, but they felt that it could actually disadvantage the city, and we pointed that out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5801.261s">So</a> if they see something like that, they'll point it out to us, and then it will be up to us whether we want to consider what they, you know,
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5831.264s">I'm</a> not sure the actual drafts are on the, in our committee materials on the website because they're, they're not, they're not our final draft. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5842.611s">So,</a> you know, how many do we want floating around say, but I'm perfectly comfortable sharing article eight with you if you just email me and I'll, and I will write very big letters on top that it's in draft form.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5864.178s">Well,</a> I think I agree with David. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5867.862s">I</a> think you're all awesome. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5868.803s">And</a> this has been really a pleasure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5870.205s">And</a> we're not done yet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5871.326s">So</a> yeah, let's get you know, so close. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5877.674s">But</a> we're doing really well, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5879.756s">I</a> mean, you know, I feel like the final report is going to be kind of like writing a dissertation, but maybe not. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5884.34s">Jean</a> is on the committee, and she seems very, you know, she said she writes reports all the time for her work, so she's not intimidated by it at all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5894.87s">She's</a> not deterred by it, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5897.513s">But</a> I think it'll be good.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5915.184s">We'll</a> be including that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5918.305s">I</a> envision that there will be appendixes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5921.626s">There</a> will be that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5922.827s">There</a> will be the survey results. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5925.948s">Gene</a> did an awesome report, the summary on all the listening sessions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=5933.13s">So</a> those will, I think, will be sort of addendums to the report, but we'll discuss that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=6001.755s">Well,</a> when the final report committee meets, if we feel like we need stuff, we'll just ask for it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=6007.422s">Maury?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=6012.808s">So</a> I will see some of you at various subcommittee meetings and the rest of you have a fantastic July. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=6023.507s">I</a> guess we're supposed to vote, but I know everybody's okay.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-20-24&start=6028.345s">Yeah.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-06-24_MCM00000768/2024-06-24_MCM00000768.html">Medford Charter Study Committee 06-13-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=0.291s">Hi,</a> everyone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1.032s">Welcome</a> to the June 13th, 2024 meeting of the Medford Charter Study Committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=11.579s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=12.199s">So</a> I want to try to get through everything tonight. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=15.101s">So</a> the first thing on our agenda is the minutes from June 6th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=20.785s">Did</a> everyone have a chance to look at them? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=22.706s">Are</a> we good with those?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=38.459s">Oh,</a> I never even thought about doing that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=51.063s">Thanks</a> for that tip. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=52.483s">I</a> may do that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=77.165s">Is</a> there someone who can do that quickly and text it to Maury? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=79.807s">I</a> can do that, Milva. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=82.689s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=83.589s">The</a> minutes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=90.777s">I'm</a> abstaining, I wasn't there, but. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=92.698s">Does</a> someone want to move? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=94.159s">Okay,</a> second?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=96.48s">Okay,</a> all in favor? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=97.721s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=99.462s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=100.382s">Okay,</a> so minutes are approved.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=104.745s">Yes,</a> so we have a lot of issues to go through. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=109.167s">So</a> we'll start, we'll just go through the agenda. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=116.29s">Um,</a> we'll go through that they're in the order that they are on the agenda. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=119.932s">First</a> was the residency requirement for multi-member bodies. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=125.014s">So</a> that was something that somebody, does someone want to say something?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=163.198s">The,</a> the article that you've got article nine and that we're not, that's not a draft that we were going to use for our charter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=171.444s">It's</a> basically was just sort of an example draft of things that go in article nine so that we can make the decisions about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=178.79s">And</a> the Collins center will draft that and fix all that stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=183.994s">Um,</a> so in terms of the residency requirement, so, um, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=192.498s">What</a> I did get a lot of notes from the call center this week on these questions and they said that it's not uncommon for there to be residency requirements. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=201.607s">I</a> know last week when we talked about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=203.388s">There</a> were certain concerns like what if somebody <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=209.189s">who</a> needed to be on a body, wasn't a resident, like the chief of police, for instance, or the building commissioner. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=217.631s">And</a> Collins Center gave some example language that they felt would address those issues. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=227.913s">Did</a> anyone have a chance to look at it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=229.213s">They</a> basically gave us an example from Fall River, an example from Northampton, and an example from Amesbury.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=249.562s">Did</a> everybody look at them? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=253.585s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=254.105s">I</a> actually don't know if I have them to call up right now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=256.607s">If</a> anybody, because I actually can't call up a Word doc on my laptop, but we won't get into that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=271.251s">But</a> everybody theoretically looked at these, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=274.973s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=276.494s">So</a> the one from Amesbury says that all appointed multi-member body members shall be residents of the city, but that that requirement can be waived by majority vote of the city council upon recommendation of the mayor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=291.666s">So</a> let's say the mayor, who is the appointing authority anyway, wants to waive that requirement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=297.45s">the</a> mayor has to go to the city council and they have to vote on it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=300.672s">The</a> mayor sets out the reasons why the waiver is in the best interest of the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=305.375s">Does</a> that make sense?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=308.997s">Yeah,</a> I just put it in the chat. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=315.742s">There</a> was the question of, do we want to put a residency requirement in? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=320.925s">If</a> we do, we have <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=324.935s">different</a> examples, and it seems like the third example, the Amesbury example, is the one that people like. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=332.498s">Ron.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=377.14s">I</a> mean, so the only boards that the mayor doesn't appoint are ones that are written into the ordinance or from mass journal law, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=386.445s">I</a> mean, because the mayor has the power to appoint. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=390.787s">That's</a> what the mayor has now, and that's what we have in our charter, in our draft charter.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=406.373s">I</a> mean, I don't, I don't think so.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=414.978s">I</a> mean, there are, I think there might be some boards where like the city council appoints some people and the mayor appoints others, but those are the ones that are, um, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=425.82s">created</a> by ordinance or mass general law or something? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=430.161s">I</a> don't know.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=568.388s">Any</a> other comments or discussion on this point?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=623.507s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=627.809s">We</a> can do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=628.749s">I'm</a> not, do people need to see it right now? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=634.82s">Jean</a> was just sharing in the chat what are the 2-9 section that we wrote, which gives the mayor the authority to appoint the multi-member bodies and gives the city council the confirmation, the power to reject, say. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=665.032s">Do</a> we want to move ahead with the Amesbury language, or what do people think?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=687.683s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=688.083s">OK,</a> let's do a roll call. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=690.264s">Ron?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=690.724s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=694.318s">Jean?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=697.1s">Danielle?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=699.841s">Eunice?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=700.621s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=702.082s">Paulette?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=704.043s">Phyllis?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=705.444s">Are</a> you not sure? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=706.565s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=707.185s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=708.045s">So</a> Maury?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=711.787s">Aubrey?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=713.368s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=716.43s">Anthony?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=724.717s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=725.718s">And</a> I'm voting yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=727.178s">Did</a> I get everybody? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=728.158s">I</a> think I did. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=730.199s">Okay,</a> awesome. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=731.699s">So</a> that is what did you vote on? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=736.521s">We</a> voted on adding a residency requirement for multi member bodies. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=743.353s">So</a> what we just voted was to add a residency requirement, but put language in that includes a waiver so that it could be waived with the mayor can take a waiver request to the city council to waive the residency requirement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=761.446s">So</a> it's not impossible that someone from outside the city could be on one of those boards, but there has to be a reason for it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=770.072s">Yeah,</a> okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=770.753s">I</a> agree with that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=772.474s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=773.546s">OK,</a> great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=776.348s">So</a> Eunice, what was your question on the rules and regulations?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=913.773s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=919.254s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=919.795s">Then</a> I will share a little bit from my conversation with the Collins Center about this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=925.897s">So</a> their recommendation was not to be that specific because the public engagement changes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=934.302s">And</a> so, you know, let's say a charter review every 10 years, the means for public engagement change. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=942.506s">So</a> they recommended just putting in language that was more general, like through all available means, or you could say through electronic means or something like that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=965.891s">Yeah,</a> well, we were talking about basically any they were talking about any mention of. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=973.478s">putting</a> requirements in the charter to put materials on the city website or, you know, in specific areas on the city website, because the means for public engagement can change over the period between charter meetings.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1011.83s">Yeah,</a> so, and as I said, this is, you know, all I'm doing for Article 9 is telling the Holland Center what we want in it, and that they're going to put standard language in, and theoretically, they would use updated language, but we could say to them, we want this section to reflect the importance of materials being available to the public, you know, as specifically as possible, or something like that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1105.314s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1105.794s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1106.814s">Ron.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1150.005s">Yeah,</a> that's a different issue.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1158.05s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1159.451s">So</a> we usually take public comment at the end, but I'm fine with taking it now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1163.533s">So</a> is everyone? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1164.354s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1165.634s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1168.582s">I</a> think Matthew wanted to speak. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1172.943s">You</a> have to unmute. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1175.543s">Yeah,</a> we can hear you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1181.365s">Wait,</a> you're breaking up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1182.205s">Can</a> you hear me? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1185.926s">We</a> can hear you, but you're breaking up.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1193.528s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1194.368s">He's</a> going to put it in the chat, I think he said. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1197.349s">Okay,</a> so do we have any more discussion on this? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1206.793s">Do</a> we have a resolution? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1209.513s">Well,</a> does anybody have one? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1212.434s">I</a> mean, what I was going to say was the move to ask the Collins Center to include language <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1224.092s">that</a> ensures information is shared through all available means and just sort of stress the importance of that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1242.565s">Yeah,</a> I'm about to look at that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1246.127s">Anyway,</a> so that was my suggestion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1249.67s">I</a> don't know what he wants us to consider before the vote. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1253.608s">We'll</a> wait. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1257.53s">So</a> just to rephrase, I would move that we ask the call-in center to include language that ensures that information is shared through all available means with the public, shared with the public, all available means. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1278.13s">Does</a> anybody want to second that?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1286.297s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1286.517s">I</a> know.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1301.209s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1301.65s">Without</a> request. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1303.331s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1305.032s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1306.093s">So</a> if we were going to include that, we're moving to ask the Council to include language that ensures info is shared with the public through all available means.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1382.308s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1382.708s">Can</a> we take that piece separately?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1386.043s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1386.463s">Frances,</a> did you want to say something?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1525.749s">Yes,</a> thank you for that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1528.811s">Ron</a> and then Eunice, and then we're going to vote.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1660.735s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1661.835s">So</a> the motion is, it's about rules and regulations, as Gene pointed out, and it's basically we're just asking the Collins Center when they draft this to make sure that they include language to ensure that the information is shared through, with the public through all available means, not, you know, and they will, I'm sure, I trust that they will phrase it appropriately. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1684.321s">So,</a> can we vote?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1776.474s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1778.495s">We</a> have the motion on the table and I will go around Anthony.

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1855.294s">So</a> you're saying you, I mean, do you want to make a motion for that?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1878.279s">Anybody</a> want a second? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1879.819s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1880.88s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1882.52s">Ron.</a>

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1944.71s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1947.092s">I</a> feel like I missed one person. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1948.673s">Did</a> I? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1950.672s">I</a> got everybody? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1951.712s">Okay,</a> Maury voted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1956.974s">Okay,</a> and I'll vote yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1959.075s">Okay,</a> awesome. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1961.016s">What's</a> next? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1962.196s">Oh,</a> the ordinances, periodic review of ordinances. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1965.257s">So</a> as you can see, the Collins Center said that ordinance reviews are, they're getting more common. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1975.701s">It's</a> becoming a standard feature of a modern charter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1978.955s">They're</a> usually done every five years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1980.776s">And</a> they gave us three examples. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1986.221s">And</a> the language is a little different in each one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1988.602s">So</a> did people have a chance to look at them? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1991.304s">I</a> did. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1991.785s">Let's</a> see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1993.206s">Where</a> are they? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=1995.308s">Let's</a> see if I don't have them for the screen. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2002.413s">I</a> think that they all said five years, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2009.293s">But,</a> you know, the first one, the East Hampton one said the city council may provide. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2014.218s">So</a> that seemed like it sort of left it open. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2018.422s">And</a> they didn't all require the formation of a committee, right, East Hampton. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2026.163s">had</a> the review just conducted under the supervision of city attorney, or if the city council so directs by special counsel appointed for that purpose. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2037.647s">But</a> the other two, I think, had the formation of a special committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2044.39s">Yeah,</a> Winthrop and Northampton. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2046.23s">Does</a> anybody have any thoughts about the different versions or how you... Do you want me to try to share my screen, Melva?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2092.081s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2092.681s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2093.562s">Jean,</a> I think we had actually language from the call-in center that had three different versions of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2102.864s">Ron?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2125.402s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2126.362s">Any,</a> let's see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2131.224s">Yeah,</a> here we go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2134.05s">I</a> agree with you, Ron. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2135.211s">That</a> was my pick, too, of the three. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2137.213s">I</a> liked the Northampton. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2138.694s">Did</a> anybody have any thoughts about the others? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2141.937s">Here's</a> the Northampton language. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2147.688s">So</a> not later than July 1st at five-year intervals, the mayor and city council shall provide for a review to be made of some or all of the ordinances of the city to prepare a proposed revision or break codification of them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2163.298s">It</a> shall be made by a special committee to be established by ordinance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2166.44s">So</a> this puts the particulars of the formation in the hands of the city government to establish by ordinance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2177.922s">but</a> it does stipulate that they're all voters and it says a couple of other details. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2184.367s">Dean.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2200.938s">And</a> it also, you know, it gives flexibility because it says some or all of the ordinances because, you know, obviously a complete review of all the ordinances every five years would be.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2226.111s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2226.872s">So</a> this, and, and this particular language leaves it sort of up to the city government, how to structure the committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2235.417s">Um,</a> Maury.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2288.904s">Like</a> we did for the charter.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2293.026s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2428.295s">Aubrey?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2450.332s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2680.293s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2681.313s">Maury,</a> did you want to speak?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2741.188s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2741.729s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2742.309s">Jean?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2771.374s">Where</a> we are is we've had several members like Northampton, but there's some question about the structure of the committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2780.797s">Did</a> I see, Ron, your hand up again? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2782.378s">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2785.459s">Maury's,</a> no? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2786.579s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2787.439s">So,</a> I mean, does somebody want to move that we accept this language pretty much as is, or do we want to talk about changing the <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2800.683s">committee</a> and putting more sort of specific guidelines on it in this section.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2823.828s">Yeah,</a> go ahead. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2827.078s">make</a> a note to the call-in center, you know, just keep in mind when you're drafting this charter that we don't currently have a city solicitor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2838.564s">So,</a> see, yeah, legal counsel. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2840.746s">It</a> could just say legal counsel.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2856.505s">Well,</a> I mean, they had a charter amendment that they tried to pass, but we didn't put that in our draft charter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2866.915s">We</a> just put that they could hire staff, but we didn't.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2919.701s">Yeah,</a> I hear what you're saying. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2921.702s">I</a> mean, currently the way the North Hamilton language is written, it seems to me that it gives the mayor and the city council the leeway to decide which ordinances that they want to review, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=2939.379s">But</a> you're saying can we say that, can we add that, let's say, providing that every ordinance is reviewed at least every X number of years.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3037.41s">That's</a> a good point.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3049.741s">So,</a> right, so you're saying if we decided to add a line saying that no ordinance should go longer than 10 years without being reviewed, and that, could that be burdensome? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3061.244s">That's</a> a big review every five years, right?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3076.328s">Yeah,</a> that's true. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3078.749s">Aubrey?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3115.545s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3117.828s">Jean?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3176.402s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3179.645s">Ron?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3243.635s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3244.617s">Maury,</a> did you have another comment?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3319.258s">Okay,</a> Eunice.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3410.941s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3412.402s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3413.862s">Danielle.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3467.771s">Okay,</a> so we've talked a lot. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3469.992s">First,</a> I just want to say timekeeping-wise, we have one more hour left. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3474.112s">If</a> we can get through everything on the agenda, we won't have to meet next week, and I'm still hopeful. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3479.233s">I</a> just want to have that in everybody's mind. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3483.434s">I</a> feel like there's three parts to this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3485.115s">There's</a> the timing of the review, which I haven't heard a lot of disagreement about every five years, as long as we use the language, some or all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3495.197s">The</a> other piece is the <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3498.255s">composition</a> of the committee, whether it should be just left to ordinance or whether we should specify. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3505.558s">And</a> the other piece is, should there be a line added that says every ordinance should be reviewed within at least every X number of years? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3517.864s">So</a> let's take them one by one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3519.825s">So</a> for the five-year review, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3524.898s">Do</a> we want to vote on that and say, like, I'll just make a motion that we have an ordinance review every five years?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3535.342s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3536.143s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3538.063s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3538.944s">So</a> all right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3542.865s">Eunice?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3544.386s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3545.547s">Maury?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3549.728s">Ron?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3553.59s">Anthony?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3556.403s">Danielle?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3558.364s">Jean?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3560.304s">Paulette?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3562.005s">Aubrey?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3563.085s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3563.985s">Is</a> Phyllis out there? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3566.106s">Yes,</a> I second the motion.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3568.686s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3569.127s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3569.807s">I</a> can't see everybody. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3570.587s">I</a> can't see the boxes now because of the screen share. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3572.587s">So</a> Phyllis, did you vote yes? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3576.396s">Okay,</a> and I'll vote yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3578.718s">So</a> awesome. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3580.339s">We've</a> got that piece done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3582.381s">What</a> about the composition of the committee? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3584.563s">I</a> mean, I guess- I'll make a motion.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3619.367s">I</a> just want to get it down right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3621.408s">When</a> you say a city councilor or appointed by?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3628.998s">Okay,</a> and same with school committee?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3648.754s">And</a> for voters, okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3651.376s">Anthony,</a> you had a comment?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3754.202s">So</a> wait a minute, guys. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3757.285s">It's</a> no, it's not the charter, it's the ordinances. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3759.528s">I</a> actually, I agree with Anthony on this because I do feel like it's in the wheelhouse of the city council, but we're gonna vote. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3766.997s">But</a> first Paulette and then Ron.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3803.539s">Okay,</a> Ron.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3843.198s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3843.819s">Wait</a> a minute. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3844.319s">So</a> that means Maury would have to amend his motion, I think.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3851.426s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3852.548s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3853.148s">Maury,</a> did you want to speak?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3922.636s">OK,</a> thanks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3925.418s">Aubrey?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3962.134s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3963.234s">I</a> think that's a really good point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3965.115s">I</a> think even the city council sometimes especially needs legal guidance when they're writing ordinances. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3974.017s">It's</a> their job to legislate, but they need guidance too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3984.04s">Did</a> the motion get seconded? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3988.041s">What</a> is the motion? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=3990.391s">Well,</a> Jean, can I just have Jean's comment and then I'll reread the motion as I have it recorded.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4003.916s">Yeah,</a> it would be instead of having the review committee established by ordinance, it would be <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4015.227s">The</a> motion is that the review committee is made up of one member appointed from the mayor's office, one city councilor, one school committee member, and four voters.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4032.218s">That's</a> a good point, Maury. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4033.978s">It</a> has to say who's appointing the voters.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4069.892s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4070.593s">Well,</a> let's vote on it and see where it's at. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4072.893s">And</a> then if we have to finesse who appoints the four voters, we will. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4077.974s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4078.635s">So</a> Ron.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4084.596s">Eunice.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4087.457s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4088.777s">Maury.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4090.678s">Danielle.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4092.238s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4093.978s">Gene.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4095.139s">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4096.499s">Aubrey.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4097.627s">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4098.427s">Phyllis?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4101.848s">Paulette?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4103.469s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4108.51s">And</a> who didn't I get?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4112.092s">Anthony.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4116.053s">Anthony's</a> no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4117.973s">And</a> I'm also no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4120.763s">The</a> motion does not carry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4122.965s">So</a> now we're back to still the question of how the committee would be, I mean, whether we want to say it's going to be established by ordinance or some other way.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4184.291s">Do</a> you want to make a motion that we keep the Northampton language?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4201.021s">Maury.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4242.975s">Yeah,</a> I hear you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4243.995s">I</a> guess my view is that I see this particular review as actually almost like a support for the city council because the city council is the legislative body. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4255.12s">They</a> get elected by the people. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4257.401s">The</a> ordinances are their wheelhouse. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4259.402s">And</a> this is a sort of a way to support them in their work of managing the ordinances. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4265.444s">That's</a> just my interpretation of this.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4302.13s">I</a> hear you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4303.45s">That</a> makes sense. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4305.071s">Aubrey.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4335.518s">Yeah,</a> good point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4336.499s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4337.199s">So,</a> um, we want to, I want to hear from Eunice and Jean and Ron, but I just also want to just point out that, uh, if we really would be awesome, if, um, uh, we, uh, could finish our work tonight.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4480.004s">Okay,</a> let's take that next, but to see, because that would be an addition. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4484.446s">So</a> right now we're just going to vote on whether we want to accept the language about the, um, from the North Hampton charter about this committee.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4497.67s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4498.23s">Anthony.</a>

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4601.745s">How</a> do you feel about that, Danielle?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4608.709s">Danielle?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4610.41s">How</a> do you feel about 15 years? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4612.13s">OK,</a> Paulette?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4616.413s">I</a> mean, can we split the difference and go 20?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4620.775s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4621.595s">So</a> the motion on the floor is no ordinance shall go more than 20 years without being reviewed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4627.659s">Did</a> we get a second?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4630.392s">Okay,</a> Maury.

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4674.976s">It</a> takes talent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4676.862s">Okay,</a> we're going on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4678.083s">So</a> we've done the ordinance review. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4679.364s">Yay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4680.104s">Can</a> I just add 1 thing?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4713.447s">Can</a> we just say, tell the call-in center that we want this section to reflect- Electronic means, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4721.041s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4721.581s">Same</a> thing we're saying for the other one? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4723.642s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4724.582s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4727.483s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4727.783s">We're</a> in the 21st century. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4729.223s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4730.023s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4730.504s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4731.324s">Now,</a> next on the agenda, but we may have already covered it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4733.885s">Was</a> there anything about multi-member bodies other than the residency? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4739.386s">Oh,</a> yeah.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4847.757s">So</a> we run into the same problem again. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4850.859s">We</a> don't know if Metro community media is going to exist for the next 10 years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4855.202s">You</a> know, it might change. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4856.403s">It</a> might be something else. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4858.924s">We</a> don't know what new electronic things going to come down the pike that maybe a website isn't a thing anymore. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4865.689s">And</a> I think that's what <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4870.27s">So</a> I guess what I'm going to ask about this is, can we do what we're doing with all the other sections and just let the call-in center use language that won't sort of tie us into something that might not exist during the tenure of the charter?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4947.726s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4948.826s">So</a> what I would like to do is just tell when we submit our draft charter and the parts of the charter that the Collins Center is going to write that we include, we want language in there to ensure that <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4968.023s">these</a> meetings are publicized by all means available, and that they're broadcast by all means available, and that they're shared by all means available, and let them come up with the language? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4984.716s">Does</a> that sound? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4985.557s">Yeah,</a> I'm amenable to that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4989.36s">We're</a> going to talk about it again because we're going to get the draft charter back from the call-in center. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4994.404s">Then</a> when we get it back from the call-in center, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=4998.112s">they're</a> going to be with us for the last three meetings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5000.713s">So</a> there'll be a chance to talk about it again.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5045.305s">I'm</a> pretty sure, isn't that an open meeting? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5047.446s">I</a> mean, I thought that that was outside the charter requirement.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5062.315s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5062.756s">And</a> they're not. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5063.976s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5064.457s">So</a> that's, I don't think we can control that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5067.458s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5067.879s">But</a> Maury.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5087.672s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5088.173s">So</a> let's let the call-in center put that language in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5091.275s">And</a> as I said, Eunice, we'll be able to address it again with them present. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5096.659s">And</a> we can work through it if we need to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5099.722s">Does</a> that make sense? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5100.422s">Does</a> that sound good?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5174.512s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5176.633s">Do</a> people need to see the language before they vote on it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5179.815s">Jean.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5192.884s">It's</a> possible, but I don't recall this in particular being there, but if you want to look, you can.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5207.668s">I</a> don't see it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5209.61s">Oh,</a> there we go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5215.154s">So</a> that's what's on the table. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5222.399s">And</a> do we have a second?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5234.359s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5235.78s">Um,</a> okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5237.021s">Let's</a> vote. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5239.182s">Uh,</a> Eunice? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5241.023s">Uh,</a> yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5242.284s">Uh,</a> Paulette? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5243.264s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5244.305s">Uh,</a> Ron?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5248.388s">Uh,</a> Aubrey?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5253.251s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5254.752s">Um,</a> Jean?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5265.813s">Maury.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5266.753s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5268.734s">Anthony.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5277.619s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5280.16s">Who</a> did I miss? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5281.281s">I</a> got Ron. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5281.941s">Danielle.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5284.382s">And</a> somebody else different. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5287.564s">Danielle</a> says yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5290.929s">And</a> you didn't get me, Milva. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5292.851s">And</a> Phyllis? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5293.792s">I'm</a> abstaining. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5295.353s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5296.354s">And</a> Aubrey? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5298.456s">Is</a> still reading?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5304.681s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5319.488s">That's</a> what it sounds like to me.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5324.492s">I</a> don't see why they couldn't do that already. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5332.138s">That's</a> how I read it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5334.46s">It's</a> just saying that they can send a notice to the mayor about this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5341.843s">It</a> doesn't say anything is going to be done about it.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5363.094s">Aubrey's</a> a no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5365.535s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5366.216s">So</a> we have five yes, three no, two abstain, so the motion passes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5371.333s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5374.174s">That</a> was all from multi-member bodies. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5376.255s">Were</a> we going to do anything about the periodic review of the need for multi-member bodies? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5381.496s">Yeah,</a> that would be another because you wanted to add that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5385.358s">I</a> think there was a note from the Collins Center on that, and the Collins Center felt that they thought that you wouldn't necessarily need it if we were doing an ordinance review, but they also had a suggestion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5404.062s">which</a> was not about putting something in the charter, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5409.164s">Yeah,</a> it was about, I think, bringing it to the city council. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5412.506s">I</a> can't seem to find in front of me their note, but I believe it was to make a recommendation that <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5423.885s">I</a> couldn't get papers, that the city clerk, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5428.428s">Put</a> it in the chat. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5429.669s">I</a> put it in the chat. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5430.449s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5431.03s">Thank</a> you, Jean. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5434.632s">OK,</a> so let's look at it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5438.374s">If</a> I can scroll down to the last chat. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5442.777s">Here</a> we go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5446.61s">recommend</a> that a city official like the city clerk produce an annual report to the city council regarding the need and operation of all currently existing multi-member bodies. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5457.595s">So</a> we could do something like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5460.517s">Or</a> if you want Eunice to make a motion about adding this section to the charter about having a review of the need for multi-member bodies, you can do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5472.063s">Jean.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5595.776s">Jean,</a> do you have another comment?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5666.492s">Yes,</a> that's right.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5679.422s">Where</a> do we want to go with this?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5705.583s">So</a> I guess what we're talking about now is something put in the final report, not the actual draft charter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5711.066s">So</a> if we're deciding that we don't want to put this in the charter and we'll enable something for the final report, then we don't have to go through the nitpicking of it right now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5721.671s">We</a> can do that at another meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5723.652s">Does</a> that make sense? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5726.068s">If</a> that's what we're deciding, that we're going to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5729.291s">We're</a> going to put something, we're going to put a recommendation in the final report.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5734.956s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5735.456s">And</a> then we'll finagle that, the details of it down the road. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5739.64s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5740.861s">Um,</a> is that it for multi-member bodies? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5743.684s">Uh,</a> yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5744.825s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5745.565s">Now</a> you said had something in oaths or affirmations.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5797.407s">Again,</a> I'll just say that this was just an example for us to see what's in this section. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5801.609s">If</a> this is mostly standard language and the call-in center will draft it, and the call-in center, one of the things that they're going to do when they draft the charter is make sure the language is all consistent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5812.016s">So</a> when we get the actual complete <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5814.437s">lead</a> a draft charter from the call and center. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5816.424s">If</a> there's still a conflict, then can we deal with it then? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5819.213s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5822.222s">OK,</a> awesome. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5824.523s">OK,</a> the public comment.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5835.088s">You</a> want to do that next? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5837.489s">OK,</a> so again, this is just an example charter that we used. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5841.911s">And</a> Ron had flagged this because he wanted to discuss this waiver option, which I am told by the call-in center is actually not common. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5852.277s">So</a> apparently Melrose does it, but it's not common. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5855.781s">They</a> theorize that one of the reasons for including the waiver would be just to not limit because it's hard sometimes to get people and this could <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5873.694s">maybe</a> address that, but it is not a common provision. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5879.44s">They</a> probably would not have included it if we were just saying draft that with standard language. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5888.257s">But</a> now that we are actually looking at an example that has it in it, the question arises, do we want that in there or not? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5895.303s">Ron</a> does not want it, correct?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5997.838s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=5998.959s">So</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6001.601s">Does</a> anybody see a reason to have the waiver?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6016.347s">Well,</a> it says one city office or position of employment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6019.809s">So</a> it could be a city office, which I interpret to be an elected office or a position of employment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6029.292s">So</a> the limitation on office holding is standard in the charter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6034.835s">What</a> is not standard is a waiver, but we happen to be looking at a charter that includes it.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6047.063s">Okay,</a> do we want to, um, does someone want to make a motion on this waiver?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6053.128s">Okay,</a> does somebody want a second?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6057.291s">Uh,</a> okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6057.991s">I</a> have a question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6059.652s">Yep,</a> go ahead, Aubrey.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6073.682s">That's</a> a good question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6076.694s">Yeah,</a> that could be impacted.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6156.545s">Yes,</a> I think that is what it implies. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6158.787s">So</a> I think the thing that Aubrey brings up is a good point, but how is it usual for somebody to work at two part-time jobs for the same city?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6180.61s">Well,</a> it says no person shall simultaneously hold more than one city office or position of employment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6186.155s">So</a> to me, it says you can only hold one position of employment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6190.319s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6190.58s">Ron?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6227.387s">You</a> can be the- So how do you think the waiver should be implemented?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6241.631s">Okay,</a> so this section may be waived by the mayor,
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6255.652s">Francis</a> also made a point that some of this would be governed by ethics laws and ethics.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6282.191s">Maybe.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6300.377s">But</a> it's limitation on office holding is the section.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6307.508s">No,</a> but they said it's it's section 911 limitation on office holding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6311.489s">So</a> that is the intent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6312.689s">So</a> I think that's so you can't work for the DPW and gene the on the school committee.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6330.799s">Like</a> I said, I'm pretty sure they would just leave the first sentence. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6335.901s">That's</a> the standard because they said the waiver is unusual. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6341.084s">I</a> do think Paulette is right that the intent of this is just to say that there's a limitation on office holding that you can't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6353.852s">I</a> think that the stuff that we're talking about wouldn't really apply. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6357.477s">That's</a> what I think.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6361.082s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6361.562s">So</a> Ron, if we're talking only about office holding, do you still think that it's okay for there to be a waiver?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6402.294s">So</a> I just want to go back to a motion that Paulette made not to give the mayor, not to include the waiver, the waiver power for the mayor, regardless of how it's applied. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6415.763s">Are</a> you still okay with that motion, Paula?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6496.365s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6497.105s">So</a> I'm going to hear from Maury and Aubrey and then we're going to vote.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6503.809s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6504.529s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6505.369s">Aubrey.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6514.813s">The</a> motion on the table is to not give the mayor any waiver power on the limitation on office holding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6526.036s">Paulette?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6527.296s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6528.297s">Aubrey?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6530.317s">Ron?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6532.838s">Eunice?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6533.658s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6535.358s">Jean?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6536.599s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6538.259s">Danielle?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6539.959s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6540.94s">Phyllis?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6543.74s">Anthony?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6547.302s">Who</a> did I forget this time? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6548.863s">Me.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6549.563s">Eunice?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6550.063s">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6550.683s">No,</a> I voted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6552.224s">Maury.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6553.004s">Maury.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6553.545s">Maury.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6556.446s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6557.226s">I'm</a> also yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6558.487s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6560.067s">All</a> right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6560.528s">We</a> have 10 minutes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6562.589s">I</a> know we're not going to make it through. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6564.049s">What</a> I'm going to ask is, are people available to meet us next week?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6577.906s">Can</a> I have a show of hands? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6579.947s">Who's</a> a yes for next week?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6586.128s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6596.727s">So</a> if, so I think we'll have a quorum. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6601.472s">So</a> even if you're maybe, are you got, are the rest of you definites?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6620.385s">The</a> rest of what we have to talk about is the addition of a section on public comment, the addition of a section on conflict of interest, ethics, etc, the addition of a section on property, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6634.183s">And</a> then just a little bit of a wrap up on talking about, I guess maybe I'll ask people now since most everybody's here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6641.748s">So</a> far for the final report committee, it's me and Gene and maybe Phyllis. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6648.713s">Does</a> anybody else?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6654.537s">That's</a> okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6655.438s">So</a> what we would do is we would meet, I don't know how many times, we're just going to have to see <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6664.207s">In</a> July and August, but my aim would be to try to finish the final report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6669.031s">By</a> the end of August, and I don't, you know, I thought whoever we have that's working on it at the 1st meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6678.138s">We</a> would talk about how we wanted to structure it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6680.741s">So,</a> I mean, I'm. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6683.022s">I'm</a> fine with writing, maybe somebody else is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6687.646s">But</a> I thought what first we would do is, you know, we have some examples of final reports, decide sort of what we're going to include in it and how we're going to do it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6695.932s">So</a> I'm sorry I'm not giving you a very clear answer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6698.534s">But</a> basically, I guess the short answer is whoever is involved is going to decide at the first meeting how to divvy up the work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6707.74s">But</a> it's going to involve figuring out how to structure it and writing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6713.283s">So</a> you could be involved in it and you may or may not do writing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6716.224s">If</a> that's not something you want to do, you could do something else. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6720.286s">But</a> I don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6722.107s">I'm</a> sorry.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6724.168s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6736.346s">So</a> you're saying if you were available, you would be willing to work?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6744.492s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6749.175s">The</a> first thing I'm going to do when I know who's interested is send out a Google, a Google, a Doodle poll or just to try to see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6758.326s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6759.186s">So,</a> and then we'll meet and we'll talk about how we're going to put this together. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6763.988s">And</a> then when we finish, because we are going to finish, we're going to be ready in October, we're going to, we send it, we give this to the mayor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6772.292s">And</a> then it's the mayor's job to figure out how we present it to the, how it's presented to the city council. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6778.514s">But</a> my assumption, I think there's a good chance she will include us in that process.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6799.248s">Yeah,</a> so what's going to happen is when we wrap this up, I'm going to take all the sections we've drafted and all the decisions that we've made and put them in a document and give them to the call-in center. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6810.818s">And</a> I'm probably going to ask for one person. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6813.04s">I</a> don't know, Aubrey, because you keep really good notes in the Google Docs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6817.423s">And</a> would you be willing to look at the document that I put together <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6823.128s">Before</a> I give it to the call-in center, just to say, oh, we talked about this or we voted on it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6831.31s">I'd</a> be happy to approve. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6833.35s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6835.75s">I've</a> told the call-in center that I would provide that for them by the end of the month and they said three weeks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6840.411s">Let's</a> just say maybe they'll take a month. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6849.413s">Theoretically,</a> by the end of July, everybody, we would have a draft charter from the Collins Center. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6857.42s">And</a> then I would send that to everybody. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6859.401s">And</a> then our committee won't meet in July. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6864.025s">But</a> you will be given the draft charter to read and prepare. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6868.989s">And</a> then in August and September, we will meet with the Collins Center and go over <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6874.258s">what</a> they have come up with. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6876.979s">If</a> we have any questions on sections, we'll be able to ask them about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6882.642s">If</a> they see anything in there that they think they should flag and say, well, is this what you meant to say here or whatever, we'll be able to work on that with them for two meetings and then <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6898.968s">Meanwhile,</a> the final report is separate from that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6902.31s">So</a> that'll be the draft charter, and then there'll be the final report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6905.451s">And</a> that will be worked on by the final report committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6907.713s">So</a> the final report committee will be working on that while the Collins Center is completing the draft. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6912.515s">Does</a> that make sense?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6918.398s">Well,</a> I would say our usual date, the first Thursday, or we could do a doodle poll, because I know people are, you know, and that might, if we met later in August, that might give people more, a little more time to read the draft charter too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6934.962s">Do</a> people want to just say the first Thursday in August, or do we want to just do a doodle poll and
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6961.723s">It's</a> August 1st. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6962.623s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6963.424s">So</a> here's what we're going to do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6964.744s">We're</a> going to meet next week. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6965.864s">We're</a> going to wrap this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6968.145s">I'm</a> going to create the document, send it to the Collins Center. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6971.306s">Aubrey's</a> going to proof it for me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6973.167s">And</a> then Maury, Gene, me, and Phyllis, so far, are on the final report committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6981.27s">And</a> then I will send out a doodle poll to those people, and we'll get together and talk about creating the final report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6987.192s">I'll</a> be in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6989.132s">And</a> everybody will have a break in July. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6991.788s">And</a> then we'll have a push. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6992.908s">We'll</a> have a big push. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=6993.829s">We'll</a> have a lot to do in August and September, but we're going to be done by October, so.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=7001.171s">You</a> know, that's a good question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=7003.112s">Maybe.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=7007.753s">Well,</a> I don't know if they're virtual. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=7011.835s">They're</a> virtual, so yeah, it's going to be virtual ice cream. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=7014.555s">Ice</a> cream in your freezer?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=7019.902s">I</a> mean, we could have a social, we could have an ice cream social, but we can't talk to our council.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=7030.008s">Well,</a> I don't know, because that will be up to the mayor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=7034.39s">You</a> know, because we're submitting our final report and our draft charter to the mayor, and then it's kind of in the mayor's hands how, where to go from there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=7046.77s">But</a> I'm thinking it's going to, I mean, I'm assuming it will go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=7051.232s">I</a> mean, we're shooting for October. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=7052.932s">So,</a> I mean, that's when we're going to give it to the mayor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=7055.093s">And</a> I don't think it would take much longer after that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=7057.134s">That's</a> my guess. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=7059.574s">All</a> right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=7060.115s">Does</a> that sound good?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=7065.336s">All</a> right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=7067.677s">Do</a> we have public comment? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=7070.998s">Yeah,</a> let's see if we have any public comment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=7073.079s">Do</a> we have any members of the public that would like to speak? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=7079.713s">Okay</a> so Maury made a motion to adjourn. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=7084.983s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=7085.884s">Great</a> and all in favor okay I will send you all an agenda for next week and we will wrap. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=7091.655s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-13-24&start=7092.155s">Good</a> night everyone.<h2><a href="../2024-06-24_MCM00000767/2024-06-24_MCM00000767.html">Charter Study Committee 06-06-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=0.111s">All</a> right, welcome everyone to the method-started study committee meeting June 6, 2024. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6.757s">First</a> order of business is to accept the minutes from May 16th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=12.822s">Did</a> everyone have a chance to look at them? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=14.664s">They're</a> good.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=18.648s">I</a> make a motion to approve. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=20.549s">I</a> agree. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=20.89s">All</a> in favor? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=23.152s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=23.292s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=25.407s">Okay,</a> now we can go right into the composition of the school committee, which we had already decided, but we had the issue of combining wards, and I believe, Ron, you had some things to say about that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=152.32s">So</a> just, so what I, when I contacted the elections department about the numbers that they provided, what I found out was that they gave us numbers from the most recent census, but the wards are drawn every 10 years and they use the federal census. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=167.065s">So</a> those are the numbers that we would be looking at. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=170.566s">And</a> they will, and the wards will, they will redo that process in 2031. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=174.168s">It</a> was just done in 2020. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=175.108s">Right,</a> it's every 10 years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=178.625s">So</a> as of now, any awards we combine, no matter which ones we combine, the numbers will work out okay because they were even when they were made. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=189.051s">Does</a> that make sense?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=331.671s">I</a> could try to dig that up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=333.032s">But</a> actually, my comment was going to be that I was going to vote for or sort of back option two, because when I looked at that map that you're referring to, Eunice, option two creates a situation where there's at least one school in each district. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=352.323s">So</a> I thought that that was a plus. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=356.806s">The</a> other reason that I liked option two was because when we discussed this before, there were comments about the demographic issues that we have a majority minority ward, which is ward, I believe it's ward seven. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=372.934s">Let's</a> see, I have that here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=377.697s">And</a> combining Ward 7 with Ward 1, which I think Option 2 does? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=385.581s">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=386.802s">Right?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=391.185s">Maybe</a> I'm wrong.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=395.247s">You're</a> right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=397.368s">No,</a> that doesn't make sense. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=398.489s">I</a> don't think it was 6.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=406.694s">Yeah,</a> yeah, no, it's seven. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=407.934s">See,</a> because, so, and seven and one, combining seven with one, one is the other ward that has the most, the largest population of minority population next to ward seven. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=428.259s">So</a> by combining those, we keep, you know, we give that, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=434.052s">We</a> dilute that power less. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=436.113s">That</a> was my thought anyway. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=438.253s">Okay,</a> Anthony.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=454.557s">Yeah,</a> because they use the census, so.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=465.321s">not</a> for drawing the wards, is my understanding.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=532.734s">We</a> have no authority to draw any wards. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=535.695s">That</a> is done in conjunction with the state and the city council every 10 years.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=547.503s">But</a> of the wards that they created in 2021, when we look at the demographics of those wards, we do have one majority-minority ward.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=623.734s">Yeah,</a> I agree with you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=627.81s">The</a> only reason I brought it up is because it has been a concern. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=630.652s">And</a> I know that we have discussed as a whole committee and the subcommittee also talked about two communities, Lowell and Worcester, where lawsuits were brought against those cities for violations of the Voting Rights Act. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=647.882s">And</a> so they then implemented ward representation because of that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=654.566s">We</a> are not dealing with that right now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=657.038s">But</a> we did look at the demographics of each ward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=659.879s">We</a> do have that information. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=663.54s">So</a> it's something that we can see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=666.42s">And</a> so when we're combining wards, I feel that it's legitimate to consider it.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=688.154s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=696.901s">Um,</a> any other thoughts on these past these particular other thing I just wanted to say is, um, we can choose not to combine the wards and leave that up to the city council. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=709.691s">It</a> would be the city council that would do it if we don't do it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=712.373s">So</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=718.446s">Can</a> we give them like, this is plan one and plan two? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=725.933s">Let</a> Ron speak. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=727.014s">He's</a> going crazy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=727.815s">Oh,</a> Eunice, I'm sorry.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=907.318s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=909.8s">Aubrey</a> and Anthony, do you still have your hand up?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=913.343s">I</a> think Ron is in front of me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=914.664s">Aubrey</a> and then Anthony. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=916.868s">Ron,</a> do you still have your?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=920.07s">Oh,</a> sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=920.931s">I</a> can't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=921.991s">Oh,</a> OK. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=923.933s">So</a> who's next then?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=955.207s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=965.337s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1140.772s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1141.692s">Anthony</a> and then Phyllis.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1167.829s">So</a> combined wards are not common. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1171.531s">But</a> Lowell does have combined wards for school committee and just straight ward representation for city council. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1179.938s">So,</a> so it is there is a precedent for it.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1187.283s">Like</a> a year or two ago? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1189.044s">Yeah,</a> right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1189.925s">And</a> Lowell, as we know, did that in response to the lawsuit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1193.327s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1195.863s">Oh,</a> go ahead.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1294.098s">Okay,</a> so we have a motion to
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1312.464s">You</a> mean for the text?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1320.868s">Yeah</a> and okay so but right now we're just I'm just going to say a motion to accept option two which I just want to write down so that's boards one seven two three uh four five and six eight am I right about that yeah thank you um a motion to accept that uh uh for the uh as districts for um <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1349.651s">for</a> the school committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1350.592s">I</a> second the presentation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1354.052s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1354.193s">OK,</a> we're going to do roll call. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1357.153s">Phyllis?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1360.674s">Eunice?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1361.734s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1363.555s">Ron?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1366.216s">Aubrey?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1369.196s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1371.077s">Anthony?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1373.958s">And</a> I'm also a yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1375.65s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1376.29s">All</a> right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1377.111s">Congratulations.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1398.09s">Yeah,</a> we may end up voting on some other article items later. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1401.453s">But</a> the other one that we have on the agenda is that we started talking about last meeting, the composition of the body for regular charter review. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1413.703s">So</a> we decided last time to recommend charter review every first five years from the time that the new charter is ratified, and then after that, every 10 years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1426.727s">So</a> but what we didn't have a chance to thoroughly discuss or agree on is the composition of that body. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1436.92s">So</a> have people had a chance to think about it?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1460.072s">Well,</a> the example charter we looked at had it as nine, I believe, nine members. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1472.353s">Four</a> appointed by the mayor, four by the city council, and one by the school committee chair. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1477.017s">Well,</a> four by the city council president. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1480.22s">So</a> I'll just put that text up.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1496.086s">Yeah,</a> we talked about some things, but we didn't come to any decisions and we were going to continue the discussion tonight. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1502.109s">So</a> Eunice and then Aubrey.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1757.654s">OK,</a> thanks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1759.075s">So</a> hold that proposal, and I just want to let other people speak, and then we'll come back to it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1766.601s">Aubrey.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1795.756s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1797.998s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1799.639s">Phyllis</a> and then Ron.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1855.514s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1858.658s">Ron.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1955.934s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1956.995s">So</a> we have a couple, we have a little bit of discussion and a couple of potential proposals. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1962.962s">I</a> got my hand up again. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=1964.825s">Oh,</a> Phyllis, go ahead.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2001.715s">So,</a> okay, so the motion is that this body that we're talking about, the Charter Review Committee, be composed of nine people. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2010.0s">Do</a> you wanna be more specific about what you said with the nomination and a review process?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2024.77s">Okay,</a> so the motion right now on the table is basically just addressing the number of people on the committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2031.345s">So</a> we could start with that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2033.226s">Yeah,</a> I mean that makes sense to break these things down. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2035.527s">Okay,</a> but we don't have a second yet but we also have a couple of comments so Eunice and then Aubrey.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2217.597s">Phyllis,</a> you're muted.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2286.93s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2287.81s">So</a> before we look at the motion for a body of nine.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2295.475s">Yeah,</a> go ahead, Anthony.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2427.923s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2428.984s">Aubrey.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2459.24s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2460.82s">So</a> that is basically adding on to Phyllis's motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2465.963s">Before</a> we go ahead with that, Veron, did you have one more thing to say?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2509.477s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2510.137s">So</a> before we go ahead with that, Anthony, did you have one more comment? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2513.4s">He</a> just didn't put his hand down. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2514.981s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2517.801s">That's</a> okay.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2555.717s">Okay,</a> so we have, so if we just start with the number, we have one proposal on the table for nine and one for 11.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2567.386s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2584.162s">If</a> it's in the charter, it's going to be that way unless it gets changed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2589.667s">So</a> it's pretty set in stone, I think. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2593.009s">I</a> think we should wait. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2599.15s">So</a> I don't know what the best way to go about this is, because we have nine or 11.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2610.715s">On</a> the nine?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2614.337s">Second?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2615.858s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2616.758s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2619.599s">Aubrey?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2621.78s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2623.801s">Phyllis?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2624.721s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2625.562s">Eunice?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2630.569s">Go</a> back to me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2632.67s">Anthony.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2635.592s">I</a> already got you Ron, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2637.473s">Did</a> I get you? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2638.414s">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2639.375s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2639.955s">Ron</a> is a yes?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2642.997s">I'm</a> a yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2643.938s">Phil,</a> Eunice? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2646.199s">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2647.52s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2648.301s">So</a> we landed at nine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2653.384s">So</a> now the next question is the composition of that or the, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2658.727s">the</a> appointments. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2660.41s">So</a> Aubrey had proposed three, three, three, three from the mayor, three from the city council president and three from the school committee vice chair.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2693.203s">I</a> mean, that's why we said vice chair, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2695.384s">So</a> if we do it that way, we could, but then those bodies would have to spend time figuring that out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2701.769s">Whereas,</a> you know, it's a quicker appointment process if it's one person, that's all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2710.054s">Anthony.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2715.578s">I</a> just wanted to say, I understand the, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2719.895s">inclination</a> to make it even between the three bodies of government. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2724.119s">But</a> the school committee is so specialized and the school committee, in terms of what's in the charter on the school committee, it's pretty narrow because the school committee is really governed by state law, pretty much the composition of the school committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2740.271s">is</a> in the charter, and maybe some very general timelines about budget. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2747.735s">Nothing</a> really even that specific about budget. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2750.737s">So,</a> I don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2753.479s">I'm</a> just, I wonder if we should make it equal due to that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2757.781s">Just</a> throwing that out there.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2772.523s">So</a> 4-3-2 is, I mean, 4-4-1 gives the mayor and the city council equal number of appointments and says to the school committee, we want you to have a representative basically. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2796.497s">I</a> mean, 432 says, well, the mayor gets more, I don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2801.443s">It's</a> just, yeah.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2813.249s">We</a> got we got. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2815.471s">So</a> it's not stressful. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2818.953s">Hi,</a> Danielle. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2819.994s">We're</a> discussing the composition of the Charter Review Committee, which is going to be nine people. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2825.738s">So</a> we're discussing how they are appointed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2830.857s">And</a> three from the mayor, three from the city council president, three from the school committee vice chair was proposed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2837.464s">And</a> then I pointed out that the school committee's role, you know, the school committee is governed by state law. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2844.351s">So</a> the charter really only addresses the school committee composition. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2848.856s">So</a> my question is, should they have as much input in the pits?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2866.288s">I</a> second that motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2868.349s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2869.73s">All</a> right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2870.25s">Let's</a> vote then. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2871.991s">Ron.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2876.614s">Aubrey.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2881.357s">Phyllis.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2883.525s">Ellis</a> says yes.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2895.109s">Anthony.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2900.31s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2901.171s">And</a> I'm voting yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2903.011s">Did</a> I miss anybody? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2903.951s">I</a> don't think I did. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2906.466s">Okay,</a> so the only thing that we didn't talk about was, I mean, we touched on some of the issues that Eunice brought up in terms of, you know, requiring that they all be residents, requiring, you know, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2925.125s">other</a> things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2925.685s">So</a> there was some discussion of that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2927.306s">Eunice,</a> do you want to?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2961.514s">I</a> mean, it could, yeah, it could be consistent or we could decide to make it different. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2966.999s">I</a> don't know, but I'd have to look back at what we said about multi-member boards. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2971.023s">Does</a> anybody remember?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2987.106s">It</a> depends on whether we say voters. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2989.786s">Just</a> to pull up the example text that we looked at says voters. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=2992.947s">So</a> if we said voters, that would put an age requirement on it.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3088.018s">Okay,</a> so that would be an argument for saying residents instead of voters.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3146.234s">Does</a> anybody remember what the language of multi-member boards? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3151.979s">I'm</a> looking it up here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3156.303s">I</a> remember we, well, we did have a discussion about using that language of voters, but that might've been for running for office.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3180.081s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3182.562s">We</a> don't say anything about it in the current language we have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3187.583s">We</a> just say that the mayor refers the names to the city council, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3196.018s">and</a> then the city council can confirm. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3199.08s">or</a> that they go in unless the city council rejects them.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3223.235s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3223.555s">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3224.235s">I</a> think the answer is we haven't discussed it yet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3227.377s">But</a> we are discussing it now in relation to the charter review body. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3231.739s">So,</a> I mean, I guess we could just combine them and say we're going to decide whether we want it to be residents or voters for any multi-member body, which includes this body. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3244.944s">Does</a> that make sense?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3274.312s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3274.892s">Well,</a> anything in the charter regarding, you know, if there are certain bodies that are governed by state law that would apply. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3282.496s">So</a> the charter is really only talking about the bodies that aren't governed by law. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3291.255s">So</a> what do we do we think that's a good approach to make this decision for all multi member bodies? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3299.432s">Voter</a> or resident?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3320.125s">I</a> think Collin Center will like, you know, catch that stuff for us.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3333.817s">No,</a> we have the charter, we have the charter body, the charter review body, but I guess we're kind of morphing, moving into the overall Articles 5 and 9 issues that people might have questions about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3351.266s">So,</a> which units, you said there's a section in there for... I think there
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3372.768s">Well,</a> if we decide we want the charter to say, you know, something about eligibility for serving on these bodies, we can just tell that to the Collins Center and they'll put it in the appropriate spot. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3387.214s">Anthony,</a> do you have your hand up? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3392.34s">Sorry,</a> I keep asking you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3394.462s">Okay,</a> so. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3396.324s">Do</a> does somebody want to make a motion on this or. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3402.951s">I</a> mean, as it is right now, if we say nothing about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3408.176s">I</a> would imagine it's up to the appointing authority, you know, the appointing body. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3412.56s">I</a> think what about.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3479.46s">Okay,</a> that sounds good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3480.941s">I</a> just want to make one point, which is that I don't think that we are required to put anything about eligibility for these in the charter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3489.906s">We</a> have the appointing authority for multi-member bodies, and if nothing is said, then the appointing authority makes a decision about who to appoint and doesn't have an eligibility requirement to deal with. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3504.855s">And</a> I think maybe in the example charter we looked at for the Charter Commission one, they've decided that they wanted that body to be voters, so they put that in that particular section. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3516.746s">So</a> I'm just throwing it out there that we can choose not to include it and leave it at the discretion of the appointing authority.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3535.355s">That</a> I don't know.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3538.858s">Right,</a> exactly.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3561.062s">Frances,</a> I think, is on her phone.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3594.198s">Must</a> be residents, not voters?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3661.465s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3662.445s">So,</a> Ron?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3666.728s">Anthony?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3668.629s">Eunice?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3669.51s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3671.211s">Aubrey?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3675.234s">Danielle?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3676.698s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3677.498s">Did</a> we lose Phyllis? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3681.339s">Ah,</a> maybe.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3685.16s">I'm</a> actually going to vote no, because I actually think for this particular thing, they should be voters. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3690.242s">But</a> that's OK. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3691.182s">So</a> we'll save residents for this.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3702.445s">And</a> that still passes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3706.32s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3709.663s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3710.584s">So</a> I think we're done with the unit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3712.626s">I</a> mean, Aubrey, did you want to say something?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3743.982s">I</a> agree with that too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3745.823s">But</a> this particular, just to be clear, what we're looking at is just an example text. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3751.686s">This</a> isn't our draft necessarily. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3755.068s">So</a> what I wanted to do with this, because we didn't have subcommittees that were actually drafting these sections, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3764.453s">is</a> make pertinent decisions and then the Collins Center will draft it for us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3769.095s">And</a> actually, I think that periodic review of ordinances was one that I wanted to look at. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3773.857s">Because</a> a lot of it is standard language, but this one we probably should decide about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3780.64s">So</a> first of all, are we done with periodic review of charter? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3783.921s">I</a> think we are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3786.162s">I</a> mean, there is a timeline here in this particular, I believe this is Melrose's. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3796.724s">You</a> know, that's probably standard language. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3799.805s">It</a> might be good to keep the timeline in there, but we can let the call-in center put that in for us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3807.288s">Are</a> people okay with that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3809.229s">Yeah,</a> it seems pretty reasonable. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3814.111s">Okay,</a> now what about periodic review of ordinances? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3818.033s">Do</a> we think every five years is good for that, or is that too often?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3832.023s">I</a> believe there are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3833.706s">It's</a> not in the charter, I don't think, but does somebody know?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3947.143s">So</a> whatever the first review of ordinances, if this gets into the charter, will be probably more extensive then. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3952.784s">I</a> do notice that the language of this one says some or all of the ordinances of the city, which is interesting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3963.126s">And</a> maybe that makes sense because I don't know, what do people think?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3976.555s">It's</a> on its code on the city website. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=3979.916s">And</a> I think it's pretty extensive.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4011.574s">Well,</a> OK, so do people think that it's a given what Ron just pointed out? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4016.875s">Is</a> it necessary to have a periodic review of ordinances in the charter? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4021.536s">Oh,</a> yeah, well.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4055.053s">I</a> think that it's not unusual for it to be in the charter and this wouldn't necessarily be, this is not the city council that's reviewing the ordinances, it's a special committee.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4091.026s">Okay,</a> Eunice, do you have something you want to say?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4170.682s">So</a> do we like, I mean, does somebody want to propose, do we like five-year intervals? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4178.423s">That's</a> pretty, does that seem like pretty often or?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4183.304s">If</a> we have the charter every 10 years after the first
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4206.616s">Sounds</a> good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4207.477s">Just</a> to be my own devil's advocate, I'll say given that this has some or all doing it every five years could maybe be more productive because you could <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4217.393s">Maybe,</a> you know, I don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4218.534s">I'm</a> just, you could cover what you didn't cover five years earlier. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4222.838s">I</a> don't, I mean, just throwing that out there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4231.025s">But</a> I think 10 years is sufficient too.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4272.136s">At</a> that five year interval, they'll do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4273.998s">And</a> then the next five years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4275.139s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4275.579s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4276.239s">Um,</a> Aubrey.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4295.546s">And</a> this particular text from this charter has this special committee established by ordinance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4303.451s">So</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4306.146s">It</a> would be sort of handing over the responsibility of deciding how many people and all that to the ordinance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4316.614s">The</a> only requirement I see in here is voters, backed voters.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4333.508s">I</a> mean, as opposed to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4337.856s">one</a> that is created so you don't like the ordinance language?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4404.342s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4405.043s">They</a> would just be a one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4406.063s">I</a> think I read this as an ad hoc committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4408.926s">Once</a> they do the review, they're done until five years later, and then it's a new committee.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4438.872s">That's</a> true. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4443.214s">So</a> what do we want to do about this? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4444.475s">Do</a> we want to... <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4447.68s">Tell</a> the call center we would like a periodic review of ordinances section or. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4451.941s">I</a> think I think I heard agreement on that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4465.904s">Yeah,</a> but the mayor, you know, is involved because. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4473.026s">But</a> the yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4474.582s">two-thirds</a> vote they can so yeah it's do we know how long it takes to review ordinances no but i but we're but we're surmising that that's one of the reasons it says some or all because um because it would may be too big of a task to actually review all of them um do we know
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4526.672s">I</a> don't I don't really understand the process, you know, based on this particular text example that we're looking at. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4535.433s">The</a> committee is established by ordinance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4539.695s">They</a> file a report with the city clerk at a date specified by the ordinance, which is basically just recommendations. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4549.378s">But</a> they are also under the supervision of the city solicitor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4554.5s">So</a> they work with the city solicitor to make the recommendations. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4560.105s">And</a> then they present those recommendations just like we're doing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4563.266s">I</a> mean, I don't think that they have any authority to change any ordinances because they're not legislators, but it's basically an advisory body.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4618.812s">Which</a> would be the city solicitor based on the way this particular Melrose's section is written anyway. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4625.736s">Do</a> we have any motions on this or do we want to?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4674.826s">Well,</a> the Collins Center won't craft. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4678.148s">They</a> can craft this if we tell them what we want. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4681.489s">They're</a> not going to say you should have a periodic review. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4684.711s">They'll</a> just give us information, but they won't draft anything. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4688.393s">I</a> mean, they might give us a memo on how common is it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4692.856s">I</a> mean, is that's what you're looking for? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4694.697s">Like,</a> how common is it for communities to have periodic reviews of ordinances? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4699.379s">How</a> does it usually work?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4862.039s">And</a> that said, this, if we put this in the charter, this is an ordinance review by a body that's not the city council. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4869.441s">So</a> it's basically like another set of eyes on the city ordinances. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4875.444s">Ron.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4887.614s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4889.615s">Anybody</a> want to second that?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4893.397s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4894.678s">Ron.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4901.021s">Eunice.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4902.421s">Eunice</a> says yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4905.263s">Anthony.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4911.652s">Danielle?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4912.973s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4920.999s">I'm</a> also a no, because I'm also okay moving forward, but the motion carries. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4928.812s">So</a> that means, so that's leading me into the next, so we have about a half an hour left and there are some other, I know that there's some issues that people want to discuss in Articles 5, 9, and 10. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4940.941s">Our</a> next scheduled meeting would be 4th of July. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4943.462s">We</a> will not have a meeting then. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4945.364s">My</a> hope, well, was that we would finalize things tonight <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4951.543s">and</a> the Collins Center said they will take a few weeks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4956.286s">Then</a> within the next few weeks, I would get a draft charter to everybody on the committee from the Collins Center. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4965.23s">Then</a> we would reconvene in August and September to go over that draft with the Collins Center and finalize it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4974.996s">Since</a> we're not going to finish tonight, I'm going to propose that we have another meeting in June.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4985.039s">Well,</a> we have this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4985.921s">We</a> have this that we just voted on getting more information on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=4992.265s">And</a> potentially whatever, I know that there are some, I was about to ask what other areas of those three articles that we haven't extensively gone through and drafted that people wanted to talk about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5005.034s">And</a> I know that there are some issues. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5006.936s">So</a> we could look at that and possibly finish it in half an hour, but we definitely won't get the ordinance review taken care of because we just voted to ask for more information on it.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5084.45s">City</a> clerk, I think we addressed in Article 2. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5089.794s">I'm</a> just talking about what I've seen.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5143.085s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5145.864s">I</a> guess I think my preference would be to keep it minimal and general and not define the bodies in the charter, because we know that changing the charter is a pretty big deal.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5183.445s">Yeah,</a> I think the con is that you can't change it easily when it's in the charter.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5195.025s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5196.065s">I</a> believe the three that they gave us don't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5198.607s">And</a> I think that, so I think that they, that, you know, and when they gave us the example to sort of template, they called it the generic modern charter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5207.73s">So</a> my understanding is that we're looking at, is that they're, they're giving us sort of the most, the most recent kind of modern charter, which is, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5224.496s">maybe</a> more broad so that it defines things, but it gives the electeds leeway to change those departments if they need to be changed or whatever. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5237.369s">That's</a> my understanding, but... No, I see your point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5243.355s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5246.117s">Does</a> anybody else have any thought about this particular section, which the example that we have, it is very short and it's pretty boilerplate language. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5260.666s">Obviously,</a> we would change Alderman, that was from another charter, but as opposed to the other option of <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5272.614s">defining</a> different agencies within this section, which would require a good bit of work on our part to look at, you know, and which ones would we define? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5284.537s">That's</a> the other question, if we did that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5287.618s">Aubrey?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5310.743s">Okay,</a> any other thoughts? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5319.353s">Any,</a> just any, I mean, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5324.12s">Do</a> we want to just say the call-in center, we're good with the boilerplate language of Article 5, or do we want to explore more deeply defining different agencies in this section?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5357.879s">So</a> the motion, uh, tell me if we're on, if this represents your motion, um, to ask Colin century to draft article five using standard language.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5380.545s">That's</a> right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5381.406s">We</a> can add Article 1 to that, too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5383.247s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5400.079s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5401.28s">Ron?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5404.623s">Anthony?</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5406.544s">Aubrey?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5407.645s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5408.335s">Eunice?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5409.336s">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5410.978s">Danielle?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5412.399s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5414.381s">I</a> say yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5416.323s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5417.905s">So</a> that leaves us with Article 9. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5421.728s">We've</a> already looked at, I mean, this is all very boilerplate language, but I guess, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5431.718s">We</a> looked at the charter review body. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5434.679s">We've</a> already taken care of that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5436.28s">And</a> so what I had asked people to do was to look this over and bring up any issues. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5440.821s">So</a> now's your time to bring them up.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5455.286s">Can</a> you tell me what section? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5456.506s">And</a> I'll pull up the section.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5478.696s">So,</a> can I propose something? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5481.079s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5483.001s">So,</a> we're going to have to have another meeting in June. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5486.666s">Where</a> we're going to look at the periodic review of ordinances. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5489.69s">My</a> proposal is that we use our next, say, 10 minutes to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5495.258s">get</a> down on paper what sections in addition to the periodic review of ordinances that we want to look at, study, and learn about so that we can decide on them at the next meeting we're going to have in a couple of weeks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5511.202s">Does</a> that make sense? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5512.743s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5539.942s">How</a> about you tell us which sections you want to look at so we can, so we have, we're going to, we're going to look at section nine, four. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5548.127s">So</a> that's ordinances.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5566.839s">Section</a> 9-3, which is rules and regulations.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5583.043s">Section</a> 9-6, which is proceed multi-member bodies.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5658.676s">So</a> maybe we can cross one of those off the list right now if you want to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5665.861s">Like,</a> for instance, computation of time is probably a quickie.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5691.506s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5692.186s">So</a> one of the things the Collins Center does when they review our drafts and then draft the other articles is that they'll make sure they'll look for consistency of language and things like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5704.691s">So</a> I don't think we have to worry so much about that because we're so fortunate to have the Collins Center. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5713.262s">basically</a> being a good editor that way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5715.183s">Wait,</a> can I just ask, does that mean we can cross that off the list? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5723.585s">Oh,</a> yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5724.325s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5765.116s">So</a> let's, I'm just trying to call that up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5768.6s">So</a> it's a document in.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5788.461s">What</a> is the name of the document? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5790.423s">Oh,</a> Article 1, 5, 9, 10. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5792.044s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5792.645s">Oh,</a> Phyllis is back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5796.669s">Hi,</a> Phyllis. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5799.192s">Okay,</a> so what you've done here is you've put a bunch of examples of other charters. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5805.819s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5806.419s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5808.762s">Okay,</a> so <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5812.384s">Right</a> now, what I have is that we can all have access to that document. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5817.749s">And</a> we're going to have another meeting in June to discuss sections 9-3, 9-4, 9-6, and 9-9, and also a question of whether to add a section on public comment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5830.259s">And</a> ethics.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5835.103s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5835.663s">I'm</a> guessing that's, I think I agree with Aubrey that that's in state law. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5842.425s">I'll</a> do a little bit more digging on that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5845.528s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5848.631s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5850.894s">Eunice,</a> do you think your questions or issues on any of those are basic enough that we could do them in 5-10 minutes? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5861.384s">Can</a> we cross one of them off the list?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5893.464s">Right</a> now, multi-member bodies is 9-6. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5897.006s">So</a> right now, I mean, this particular, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5901.593s">Let</a> me just call it up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5902.573s">The</a> example that we have is Melrose. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5905.534s">But</a> the question for us is, what specific things do we want in that section? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5910.556s">So</a> this is pretty boilerplate, this section A. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5923.778s">And</a> so which section were you? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5926.739s">I'm</a> sorry, Eunice, can you repeat what you said you wanted to look at?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5946.368s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5947.548s">Or</a> we just decide that if the committee decides they want to do that, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5955.753s">then</a> we can just tell the call center that we want to add that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5960.797s">So</a> basically what you want is you want a residency requirement for multi-member bodies. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5967.242s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5968.122s">Okay,</a> so resident as opposed because we've had this discussion resident versus voter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=5972.486s">Well,</a> resident as in
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6026.93s">You</a> know, and I see a note from Frances in the chat, because she, remember, we had a question for her, and she heard her name, but she couldn't unmute, but now she maybe can unmute, and I think our question was related to this, right, for Frances?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6176.648s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6178.689s">Aubrey,</a> did you have your hand up?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6193.436s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6197.738s">For</a> particular bodies, like for instance, yeah, so. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6205.185s">So</a> Eunice, I mean, did you want, so we've had a discussion about should we add the requirement that you're talking about in section 96, the uniform procedures governing multiple member bodies. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6221.499s">Do</a> you want to make a motion or?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6382.379s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6383.2s">Aubrey,</a> did you want to?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6385.742s">Yeah,</a> Aubrey and then Anthony.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6419.861s">Thank</a> you, Aubrey. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6420.682s">So</a> Anthony, and then we got to wrap this up, Anthony.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6534.895s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6535.957s">So</a> we've had a good discussion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6537.339s">Eunice,</a> do you want to make a motion or how do we want, do we want to?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6669.702s">And</a> I think the intent is for these bodies to be filled with Medford residents. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6674.406s">So</a> in the case that it wouldn't happen, it would be rare. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6678.59s">But</a> yeah, so. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6682.013s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6698.872s">Do</a> we want to vote on that?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6727.026s">Wherever</a> possible is very vague. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6729.207s">I</a> don't, I mean, you know.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6738.812s">It</a> sounds vague to me, but I don't know what it means. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6741.553s">Like</a> if I read that, I would be like, I don't know what that exactly means, but I mean.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6763.518s">I'm</a> sorry, I just, I really do it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6765.48s">We</a> do have to end in two minutes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6766.781s">So</a> let's keep this on the list and let's put it, let's finish this discussion at our next meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6775.895s">Okay,</a> so let's schedule that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6779.337s">I</a> would like to propose that today is June 6th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6782.398s">I</a> would like to propose June 20th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6785.98s">How</a> are people with that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6786.96s">20th.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6787.24s">To</a> wrap everything up? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6790.341s">That's</a> a Thursday evening, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6792.422s">Yeah,</a> or next week. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6797.304s">We</a> could do June 13th.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6810.222s">Okay,</a> but not on Thursday, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6812.863s">As</a> far as I know, not on Thursday. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6815.644s">Yeah,</a> I'd go for the 13th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6817.965s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6818.766s">Do</a> we have other people that can do the 13th? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6820.426s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6827.171s">Yeah,</a> I know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6827.591s">I</a> know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6827.812s">I'm</a> getting to that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6829.392s">So</a> I will send out an agenda. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6830.792s">We</a> will wrap everything up next week. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6832.953s">And</a> then the other thing we have to talk about is we're going to skip July. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6840.335s">Once</a> we wrap up next week, you should have a draft charter to read, and then we'll reconvene in August. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6846.276s">But</a> I do want to form a subcommittee to work on the final report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-06-06-24&start=6850.335s">So</a> does anybody at the top of their head want to be involved on that subcommittee?

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=3645.731s">Anthony,</a> do you wanna go next?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4030.827s">Mike,</a> do you want to go next?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4353.694s">Matt,</a> do you want to go?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5469.673s">Thank</a> you so much for this presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5471.774s">I</a> think we have a lot to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5475.655s">I</a> have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5479.297s">When</a> you talked in your slides, there was the option of a complete rewrite or revisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5488.24s">And</a> given that we currently have a planned government, if the committee decides we, <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5495.55s">Does</a> that mean we have to decide not to keep the plan and just write a charter that's separate from the plan government? <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5505.476s">Would</a> that qualify as writing a new charter? <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5508.358s">Or</a> if we just want revisions, does that mean we can keep plan A and make revisions to it? <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5516.443s">How</a> would that work, given that we already have a plan government? <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5520.265s">So</a> you could- Go ahead, Mary.<h2><a href="../2022-05-23_XXXXXX00039/2022-05-23_XXXXXX00039.html">Milva McDonald</a></h2>

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=226.58s">Oh,</a> thanks. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=227.881s">It's</a> she her.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=250.669s">Well,</a> I think I'm going to give a shout out to a couple of bakeries. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=255.313s">Colette.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=255.934s">I</a> really like Colette. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=256.954s">I</a> like their pastries and Goldilocks bagels.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=266.483s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=275.805s">Well,</a> charter review. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=277.066s">So</a> the charter of a city or town is often people will compare it to the Constitution of the city or town, it just sort of lays out the form of government. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=286.353s">So</a> we have a form of government in Medford called Plan A, and it was adopted in 1986. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=290.517s">And</a> it's known as strong mayor. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=295.44s">So</a> it means that we have a mayor and a city council. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=300.064s">And</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=301.988s">So</a> the charter just sort of lays that out how many city Councilors we have the terms of office, what to do if one of them resigns or can't serve anymore. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=314.556s">Just</a> a lot of things like that and also the school committee. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=317.655s">the</a> composition of the school committee. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=319.116s">So</a> just sort of the basic form of government, how it operates, whether there are term limits, things like that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=327.703s">The</a> mayor is the head of the school committee. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=331.006s">All</a> those things are laid out in the charter.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=345.05s">Absolutely,</a> yeah. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=345.93s">Whether</a> we don't have board representation, which is actually unusual for a city of our size. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=351.872s">So,</a> you know, that's something that could be looked at in a charter review.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=368.556s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=369.196s">So</a> there's eight wards and, um, if let's, let's say the, the. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=375.139s">Charter</a> got reviewed and ward representation was implemented for the city council. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=380.921s">It</a> could mean that you'd have eight. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=385.239s">Ward</a> representatives and then a certain number of at-large or maybe the wards would be maybe a council would run for two wards. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=393.762s">I</a> mean, these are all things that a charter review committee or commission would closely look at to determine, you know, what might work best for Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=404.821s">The</a> thing about at large, one of the things about at large is that it makes it harder for people to run for office in some ways, because it takes a lot more resources. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=418.671s">You</a> know, you have to come up with the money and the time to campaign all over the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=424.295s">And</a> the other issue is that some people <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=429.398s">feel</a> underrepresented because they don't have a Councilor that's from their ward, even though all the Councilors are at large and they represent the entire city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=437.968s">There's</a> maybe certain awards that have had much less representation over the years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=444.275s">So</a> I think that that is definitely an issue that people are interested in exploring.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=472.834s">Yeah,</a> I mean, it could, or maybe not. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=478.254s">I</a> mean, and the other thing with the charter review is, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=481.942s">We</a> don't, I mean, it would be looked at, but we don't know. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=484.584s">That's</a> not, it doesn't guarantee that we would have board representation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=489.328s">It's</a> definitely one of the pieces that would be looked at. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=492.31s">And,</a> you know, and whatever group does review the charter is gonna look at other communities, you know, actual data and just, you know, information that will really help them determine what's best for Medford.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=537.11s">Um,</a> well, it was specifically mentioned at one of the recently the mayor put forth a home rule petition to ask the city council to vote on putting electing a charter commission to review the charter charter review the commission and be voted for three. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=560.128s">but</a> that's probably not enough to get it over the hurdle at the state house so our group is looking for other ways now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=566.191s">But</a> during those meetings there was ward representation was specifically mentioned by one of the Councilors as a concern and part of the reason for that was because a different Councilor had asked for ward representation to be <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=582.042s">part</a> of the elected charter review commission that the mayor was trying to get going. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=588.406s">So</a> yeah. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=590.788s">And,</a> and, uh, you know, there were, there weren't big discussions about it, but yeah, there definitely was one Councilor who expressed concern about it.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=610.835s">Yeah,</a> it's the whole it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=612.776s">It</a> is. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=613.876s">I</a> mean, it's definitely complex and right now, our group. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=618.818s">I've</a> learned a lot myself in the last few months we've only been meeting for a few months and we're all learning as we go. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=626.942s">right</a> now we're just in the process of trying to get the charter review to happen and there's a certain level of frustration that it's so difficult to do that because it seems you know it seems sort of like a given um gee yeah let's look at it let's review it the the review process however it unfolds is going to take <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=647.249s">Time</a> and then, and the voters will be involved and no changes, you know, any changes that that are proposed will not happen quickly so it's not like a radical or, you know, rushed idea to. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=665.658s">to</a> have voted on this home rule petition or to get it going. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=670.602s">I</a> mean, it's going to take a lot of time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=672.104s">So</a> the fact that it's taking so much time just to get to the review is kind of a little frustrating. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=678.269s">But</a> we're really committed and we're going to make it happen one way or the other. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=684.835s">There's</a> two ways to do it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=687.97s">The</a> way that Medford has tried to do it is kind of a different way from the, like, if you look at sort of, if you Google charter review in Massachusetts, you'll find documents that say, well, there's two routes to charter change. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=698.878s">And</a> the route that Medford took was actually sort of a hybrid of those two. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=703.522s">So</a> one is outlined in Massachusetts general law, chapter 43B, and it involves collecting signatures from 15% of registered voters in the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=715.05s">And</a> then the question of once that's done the question of whether to review the charter and candidates for an elected commission bow on the ballot. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=724.853s">And</a> at the next municipal election, which in our case would be 2023 and then that commission works for 18 months. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=734.606s">the</a> changes they propose, if any, then go to the voters. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=739.628s">So</a> that's, you know, we're talking at that, with this process, assuming that we collected all the signatures, we would have a new, potentially have a charter changes on the ballot in 2025. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=753.254s">So</a> the other way is to do it through, it's called the special act, and that kind of charter is called a home rule charter. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=762.498s">A</a> special act charter, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=764.927s">basically</a> just goes through the city council as a home rule petition. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=769.71s">So</a> most cities in town to do that, they form a committee, the committee reviews the charter, takes as long as they need to. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=779.598s">And</a> there's many cities and towns, most of them probably do it this way because the burden of collecting the signatures is pretty high. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=788.964s">So</a> this committee takes however long they need to take. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=794.821s">example</a> of a community community that's doing that right now is Somerville, and they have, you know, clearly, it's a process that can involve a lot of public participation in there in their case, there's tons of public participation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=809.088s">They're</a> constantly communicating they're constantly trying to get people involved to hear what <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=815.21s">What</a> kinds of things, you know the community wants, and then when they propose their changes they go through mayor and the city council and then they go through the state house, and then most likely to go on the ballot so. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=829.156s">So</a> what Medford did with that home real petition was took. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=833.639s">portion</a> of Chapter 43B and made it into a Home Rule petition. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=837.603s">So</a> it was kind of a mix. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=840.305s">It</a> was like, we're going to try to elect the commission without collecting the signatures and doing it through a Home Rule petition instead. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=847.671s">But</a> it hasn't worked. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=848.893s">So</a> we're pursuing these other avenues now.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=872.548s">Well,</a> they, the, basically it goes to the city council as sort of amendments to the charter. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=879.671s">And,</a> um, and then that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=882.52s">And</a> then it sort of becomes, it's a home rule petition and then it goes and becomes a piece of legislation so a home rule petition becomes a piece of legislation at the State House. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=891.937s">You</a> know, I mean, part of what I've done in trying to understand all this is I'll go to the Massachusetts legislature website and just search charter review. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=903.005s">And</a> you can see there's any number of bills from different communities. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=907.949s">And</a> they all have different things in them, but like amendments, you know, it's the language of whatever they want their new charter to be. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=916.315s">And</a> so they have gone through the process of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=921.081s">however</a> they came up with those amendments, whether they had a committee of residents doing it, or then it's gone through the city government and then it goes to the state house and then they vote on it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=932.905s">And</a> it's not in the law that it has to go back to the voters of the community, but when there's significant changes, generally the state wants the people of the community to vote on it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=945.729s">So</a> any significant changes most often either whether <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=951.706s">whether</a> you use the signature route or the special act route, go back to the voters to vote on.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=962.813s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=963.454s">Or</a> as my husband keeps saying, well, you need a flow chart. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=966.195s">And,</a> uh, I said, yeah, we do need a flow chart. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=969.518s">I</a> mean, the, one of the issues in Medford is that we, we still don't exactly know which route we're taking. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=976.836s">Um,</a> we don't know, you know, our group is like, we say we're, um, we're doing parallel tracks. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=982.818s">We're</a> working on, we're laying the groundwork to collect those signatures if we need to do it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=988.0s">Um,</a> but we're also trying to work with the mayor's office to see if we can get a committee going. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=995.023s">So</a> we're kind of doing both. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=997.384s">Um,</a> so that, uh, cause, cause we were gonna, we're gonna get this one way or the other. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1003.366s">Um,</a> but, uh, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1005.99s">But</a> yeah, once we know which route we're taking, it will be much easier to talk about it, because then we'll just sort of be ready to go. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1014.381s">Right</a> now, we're just trying to get it going.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1035.93s">Oh,</a> absolutely.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1046.896s">It</a> does. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1048.079s">HAB-Charlotte</a> Pitts, COB.: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1049.08s">:</a> Think there is no I mean our group, you know, I mean I HAB-Charlotte Pitts, COB.: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1051.844s">:</a> There are people from all over the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1055.568s">It's</a> not, you know, I mean, it's, it's actually kind of awesome, you know, to to get together with other residents and get to know neighbors and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1065.344s">I've</a> worked on and off in different groups in Medford, but this group, it's really, and everybody's kind of there for the same reason. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1073.733s">We're</a> like, we really want charter review to happen. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1076.156s">That's</a> what we're working on. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1078.438s">That's</a> the sole agenda. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1081.321s">And</a> yeah, it's great.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1100.217s">I</a> think that's three times the council has voted that same way. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1104.22s">This</a> current council has voted that way twice. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1106.882s">And</a> the council before this council also was 4-3. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1111.871s">And,</a> you know, that was also particularly frustrating for us because one of the first things our group did, because we knew that homeowner petition existed, was we reached out to all the city councilors and we tried to have meetings with the councilors who had voted no last time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1127.136s">And</a> we were able to meet with two of them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1131.277s">One</a> of them just didn't respond to us. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1134.564s">And</a> they were both really supportive. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1137.527s">And</a> in fact, the ward, one of them said, I really want word representation on this commission. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1144.152s">And</a> so we contacted the mayor, we got that into the home rule petition. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1148.795s">And</a> we felt really, really positive about those conversations and about the support that the Councilors, I mean, we, our intention going into those meetings was <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1162.734s">let's</a> hear what their concerns are. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1164.515s">And</a> what we heard was that their concerns were about representation and then we were able to address them, which felt great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1173.0s">And</a> they both expressed support and then they changed their minds. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1177.862s">So</a> it was tough, it's hard, but we're moving forward.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1191.075s">Well,</a> we're the Medford Charter Review Coalition, and we do have a website, medfordcharterreview.org. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1200.118s">I</a> mean, I consider us to be sort of an ad hoc group that we've come, I mean, this particular group has come together, I think it was like December or January, January, I think, but I don't wanna take away from the fact that people have been working on charter review in Medford for many years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1219.025s">Jim</a> Silva, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1220.862s">a</a> big part of the group now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1222.543s">He</a> has been working on it for a long time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1225.925s">Michael</a> Ruggiero, who actually has since moved out of the city, but he worked on it for a long time and they undertook the Herculean task of the signature collecting and actually got close to 5,000. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1243.7s">So,</a> you know, I mean, right now our estimate is that we'd have to get about 7,000 signatures. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1252.264s">It's</a> just, 15% is just under that, but you kind of need a pad. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1256.446s">So,</a> and, you know, so they came and it would have been fewer when they were doing it, because they were, you know, it's probably the, there were fewer registered voters, but they came really close. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1271.631s">And</a> so, you know, that just sort of is a testament to how many people want it and the amount of work that people have put into it.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1306.754s">I</a> feel like it's fundamental. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1308.375s">I</a> mean, and I've felt this way for a while because I, you know, I hear so many people talking about issues that they're concerned about. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1317.698s">And</a> I always think, you know, charter review could make a difference with that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1321.119s">I</a> mean, in particular representation, people are concerned about representation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1326.801s">Charter</a> review could make a big difference with that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1330.782s">You</a> know, I hear people talking about <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1333.5s">I</a> mean, there's, you know, I, I don't have an opinion on this because I haven't looked at the details or I haven't really looked at it closely but some people say well the mayor. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1343.922s">You</a> know, if the mayor wasn't the head of the school committee, then it would be better for the school committee. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1349.105s">It</a> would be better for the mayor. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1350.406s">I,</a> like I said, I don't know, cause I haven't looked at it, but that's an issue that would have to be looked at through charter review. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1358.77s">I</a> hear people saying, you know, what about term limits? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1362.152s">I</a> mean, we had a mayor in office, I think for, was it 28 years or something like that? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1369.176s">We</a> have Councilors in there for decades. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1372.458s">I</a> mean, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1373.68s">I</a> don't, again, I don't know, because I haven't really looked, I don't have an opinion really on, a strong opinion on any of these issues because I haven't looked at them closely enough. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1386.892s">But</a> I do think, I do have enough of an opinion to say, yeah, that's definitely something we should look at. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1394.219s">And</a> the only way to look at those really and to make a change is through a charter review.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1426.642s">Yeah,</a> I've heard that many times over the years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1429.584s">And</a> that's, again, comes back to charter review.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1442.994s">That's</a> absolutely that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1445.196s">And</a> many other communities have provisions in their charter that say the charter will be reviewed every 10 years or every eight years or whatever. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1454.323s">And</a> that's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1455.27s">definitely</a> something that people are interested in doing so that every decade or whatever is decided when the committee or commission looks at the data. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1466.68s">So</a> this doesn't have to happen again. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1470.143s">We</a> don't have to go and try to fight to review our city government. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1474.506s">I</a> mean, because it's starting to feel like, yeah, we have to fight for this, which, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1482.242s">astonishes</a> me.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1499.676s">Yeah,</a> yeah, I yeah. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1503.899s">Definitely.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1504.439s">I</a> agree with that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1512.392s">We</a> meet once a month, and we will sometimes have smaller groups or meeting. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1517.876s">I</a> mean, there's subcommittees, but everybody is invited to them kind of every two weeks, in the middle of the month, we might do that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1525.802s">If</a> we have something, like recently, while we were making brochures, things like that, getting the website up and running, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1537.137s">I'm</a> trying to get plan out the game plan for the signature drive if we ultimately have to do that, talk about you know how we're going to approach the mayor. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1548.765s">So,</a> so if we have something pressing then we'll, we'll add an extra meeting.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1560.387s">definitely</a> check out the website, because the website sort of it's it talks about the group, but there's also a resources section where people can look at. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1570.336s">I</a> mean, I think looking at what other communities have done and are doing is really helpful. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1575.661s">And,</a> you know, if anybody sort of interested in, you know, I mean, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1581.406s">the</a> details about how charter review works or how it happens, we have resources on our website. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1587.207s">So</a> I would say just learning about charter review is a great way to get involved. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1594.889s">And</a> the meetings are open to anybody in Medford, so come to a meeting. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1600.111s">And</a> if we collect signatures, we'll be looking for volunteers for that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1607.652s">And</a> the more people that get educated and get involved <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1611.382s">the</a> more they can interact with the committee or commission and perhaps even decide to be on or to try to apply to be on a committee or to run for the commission. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1622.152s">Because</a> we do need, I mean, we do need representation on whatever committee or commission that's up and running. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1632.02s">So</a> yeah, so those are some ways.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1648.983s">That's</a> a question that has been asked and I haven't been able to get the definitive answer, but the answer that most people I've asked seem to think that it's not, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1661.987s">limited</a> that anybody can run for those positions, even people who are already elected to office. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1666.949s">I</a> don't know that they would, but you know, it would be a process of running for office. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1674.313s">It</a> would mean that the people would have to collect signatures to get on the ballot, you know, nomination papers, and I mean, I don't know how many people <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1685.747s">ever</a> run for officer know what's involved, but you have to get you have to get signatures, get on the ballot, and then you get on the ballot, and then you have to campaign, you have to get your name out somehow. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1695.696s">And,</a> and this is, you know, completely volunteer position. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1699.56s">So,</a> again, there's a huge burden in collecting the signatures is a huge amount of work. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1705.505s">And</a> then once those signatures are collected, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1709.674s">people</a> have to run, and then whoever chooses to run has to put in the work to get on the ballot campaign, and then put in the 18-month term of learning about the charter, coming up with those recommendations, and it's all volunteer. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1727.51s">So</a> it's a big ask. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1730.272s">So</a> from that point of view, appointing a committee of people, they're still volunteers, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1737.055s">it's</a> taking away some of the burden that, you know, maybe somebody who really wanted to be involved in charter review might be willing to do it, but if they found out they had to run for office, which is a considerable amount of work.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1760.305s">Yeah,</a> exactly. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1762.706s">It</a> is cost if you want, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1765.294s">create</a> literature. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1766.415s">You</a> want to, you know, do a mailings are very expensive. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1771.378s">So</a> yeah, there's that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1787.289s">Exactly.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1789.151s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1798.262s">I</a> don't think so. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1799.022s">I</a> mean, I just, I really hope that people just continue to get involved in Charter Review. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1806.146s">I</a> know, you know, we started, like I said, meeting, I think our first meeting was in January. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1812.57s">And</a> it was pretty good turnout for first meeting. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1815.772s">I</a> just put it out like on the, you know, Medford politics groups on Facebook and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1821.619s">And</a> there were about 30 people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1824.2s">And</a> since then, we have over 100 people on our list now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1829.521s">And</a> one of the things that we talk about is outreach. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1833.903s">We</a> really wanna find ways to reach out to just different groups in the city, go to like the West Metro Community Center, the Senior Center, the churches, the Chamber of Commerce, just as many places as we can to reach <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1851.466s">different</a> populations that hopefully will get involved in this and either learn about it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1859.951s">We</a> really want people to learn about it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1862.252s">Either</a> maybe they'll be interested in actually trying to serve on a committee or commission or just communicate with whoever does that so that this review is truly a community <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1877.903s">voice,</a> you know, we want the voice of people in the community to be involved in this because it's our city government and it makes a difference in everything, in our lives, in our daily lives.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1907.738s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1908.498s">I</a> mean, that's another group that we want to reach out to. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1912.481s">Well,</a> there's the CCSR. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1914.802s">I</a> think that's the right acronym at the high school that gets involved in a lot of civic issues in the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1921.906s">But</a> yeah, absolutely. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1924.987s">I</a> mean, getting young people involved is very important to me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1932.616s">I'm</a> glad you brought that up.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hv4PkplUgRblXxurghIfC?t=1943.273s">Yeah,</a> that's right.

<a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1409.744s">I</a> ask that you honor the support you expressed to us and vote in favor of this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1415.563s">While</a> it is not the only route to charter review, it is the most expeditious in the current moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1422.125s">And</a> it offers you a chance to respond to your constituents and show that you value their concerns and you value their civic engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1431.028s">For</a> what better way to promote civic engagement than inviting every resident of this city to join in reviewing how their city government works. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1442.293s">We</a> are determined to partake of that opportunity, indeed of that right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1447.836s">Collecting</a> signatures is not the only other alternative available. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1452.218s">We</a> are exploring all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1454.619s">And</a> if this petition fails, we will pursue them as swiftly and as transparently as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1461.503s">Every</a> city has the right to a review, and we will have ours. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1466.205s">It</a> is up to you to decide whether you will help to honor that right in this moment or choose to delay it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1473.532s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_s4ePTNAg4Nw/2024-11-19_s4ePTNAg4Nw.html">City Council 02-08-22</a></h2>
