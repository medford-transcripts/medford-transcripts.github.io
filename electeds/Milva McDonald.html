 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8671.38s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8672.961s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8673.922s">Thanks</a> for taking my question, and thank you for your work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8677.204s">My</a> question is about, I live near West Medford Square, and <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8682.481s">When</a> I look at the map, I'm just curious about how the boundaries of the square were determined and how you made the decision to make some residential properties mixed use. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8695.207s">When</a> you walk out from the square, when you walk down Harvard Ave, there's maybe a block to max of businesses and then the residential area starts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8705.031s">And</a> it looks to me like the, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8707.918s">It's</a> being stretched now further so that, for instance, there's a gorgeous old house on the corner of Harvard and Boston Ave that is being zoned for mixed-use 2A, which I believe means it could go to seven stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8723.89s">And</a> then I think the house next to it is mixed-use 2A. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8728.193s">And</a> then some of the other properties around are urban residential, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8732.502s">So</a> I'm just curious what the thought process was around that and how you decided to make some residential properties mixed use and basically change an area that is currently residential to something else.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8752.435s">No,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8761.232s">I</a> believe it's Yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8762.712s">I</a> mean, I think the house next to it is also zoned as mixed use too.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8792.327s">Yeah,</a> this one's not because I know who lives there and I've been in it many times.<h2><a href="../2025-06-26_EO-vAhUJAKo/2025-06-26_EO-vAhUJAKo.html">Zoning Q&A/Info Session - Medford Square 05-08-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6321.44s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6322.141s">Mildred</a> McDonald, 61 Monument Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6324.224s">I</a> just have three quick questions and I'll be brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6327.108s">One</a> is about the interactive map. <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6329.23s">Thank</a> you for making it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6330.272s">It's</a> really awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6332.354s">My</a> question about it is... <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6335.621s">dived</a> in too heavily, but the nuances that were referred to earlier, will those be, will those show in the interactive map? <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6343.385s">If</a> you're looking at the interactive map at a particular property, will you be able to tell some of the nuances that were mentioned earlier about, or will you just see, oh, they can go seven stories, but the nuances that might prevent that, will those show in the interactive map? <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6359.593s">That's</a> one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6360.833s">My</a> other question is for the squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6365.473s">Does</a> this process at all look at some of the traffic issues or particular hairy intersections? <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6370.816s">I'm</a> thinking in particular of the Route 60 and Playstead and Harvard Ave where the commuter rail crosses, where the train crosses, and it's pretty precarious right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6381.681s">So</a> I think there's some concern of residents that increased density could create safety issues and difficulties. <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6389.265s">And</a> so how does this process incorporate that? <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6392.407s">And</a> I know you don't know what's going to happen exactly as a result of the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6396.07s">So</a> I know that's part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6397.271s">But</a> just wondering where along the line, maybe does that come in? <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6400.953s">And</a> my third question is a little unrelated to the squares, but since private ways have come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6408.078s">I</a> could be wrong about this, but my understanding is that there's a process to change private ways to public ways, and that could potentially be initiated by the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6417.425s">And</a> since we have so many, and based on the map I looked at, sometimes they cover a whole neighborhood, like Lawrence Estates, for instance. <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6424.971s">Has</a> the City Council ever considered trying to make some of those roads that really do function as public ways, public ways? <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6432.636s">So</a> those are my questions.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6748.906s">Yeah,</a> like what Zach earlier was saying how, you know, if you look and see, oh, nine stories can go up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6756.717s">with</a> the incentive and you live near it and you're freaked out about that, it might not necessarily be true because there's other factors that would prevent that from going up.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6856.016s">No,</a> I think the map is awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6857.297s">Thank</a> you so much.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6927.113s">So</a> basically the map is great and it gives you good general information, but don't make assumptions about individual parcels based on the general information.<h2><a href="../2025-04-15_j2zlMvp6B6U/2025-04-15_j2zlMvp6B6U.html">Special Meeting of the Medford City Council 04-15-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=9089.148s">No,</a> I'm not correcting you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=9092.09s">You</a> get credit for digging up those newspaper articles. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=9094.772s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=9095.653s">I</a> just was able to disseminate them. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=9099.055s">But</a> I believe also on the website is the legislative package from 1986, which I collected from the Mass Archives. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=9106.101s">So</a> that's another piece of information that people can look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=9109.748s">and</a> also the report from the 1978 Charter Study Commission in Medford, which created a whole charter that actually didn't make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=9120.451s">So</a> there's a lot of charter history available on the Charter Study Committee website under resources, if anybody's interested. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=9129.213s">That's</a> all, thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=9130.433s">And</a> thank you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=9132.394s">And</a> sorry, Milva McDonald, 61 Monument Street.<h2><a href="../2025-04-09_4-jeNb9kYhc/2025-04-09_4-jeNb9kYhc.html">City Council Meeting 04-08-25</a></h2>

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6903.248s">Milva</a> McDonald, 61 Monument Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6905.451s">I'm</a> going to try to talk fast. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6907.674s">There</a> was a lot of things said about the committee, so I just want to address a few of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6911.499s">I</a> may have misunderstood, but I thought I heard someone say that the Charter Study Committee left information out of the survey that we didn't want <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6921.952s">to</a> include. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6923.013s">So</a> if I misunderstood that, I would like, please correct me. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6926.994s">But</a> I would just want to say, if you have that impression, please come and talk to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6932.537s">Because</a> as far as I know, it is absolutely not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6936.258s">I</a> also just wanted to say, and this has been said before, district representation was not asked about because it does not happen in Massachusetts on city councils. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6946.563s">And</a> there have been references by Councilors to communities that have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6949.924s">And</a> I would love to hear the names of them other than Boston and Worcester. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6954.225s">Boston</a> is essentially not comparable. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6957.106s">State</a> law even separates it out from other municipalities. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6962.207s">And</a> Worcester is the second largest city in the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6964.748s">So</a> I am truly interested in hearing about the other communities that have it on city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6971.01s">Ward</a> representation has a definition that is understood. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6975.831s">People</a> know what it means. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6977.632s">So</a> when all of you ran on it, that's what they understood. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6981.115s">When</a> all of you have said for five years, 100% in favor of ward representation, when you said to us in interviews that you were in favor of ward representation, everybody knew what you meant. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6995.867s">So</a> the reason it wasn't asked was because it wasn't on our radar, because it's not really done. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7000.93s">When</a> the school committee subcommittee started digging in, they found that it is, there are a few school committees that have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7008.594s">And</a> I won't go into the, I've said it before, it's in the final report, why it was considered to school committee, but not city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7017.34s">I</a> also wanna say, this is not like the Senate. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7021.142s">The</a> problem with the Senate of our country is that you have senators who represent very small numbers of people and others who represent massive numbers of people who have the same power. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7036.027s">each</a> ward representative would represent the same number of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7040.99s">So</a> you may have a problem with the fact that some wards have low voter turnout and ward three that has high voter turnout has had a disproportionate number of representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7052.117s">And</a> I personally don't think that's an accident, but please don't say it's like the Senate because it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7060.807s">The</a> demographic research that has been done is great, but the demographics will change. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7067.072s">And</a> this charter is going to be in place for, if it passes, for at least 12 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7072.577s">If</a> you're confident that the demographics are going to be exactly the same and the district method will serve, will fix whatever you think ward representation won't, <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7083.386s">That</a> makes sense, but I don't think, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7086.909s">I</a> don't think any of us think that demographics are gonna stay the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7089.991s">The</a> housing studies that have been mentioned, we also addressed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7094.654s">If</a> there are more, I want to see them. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7096.916s">Please</a> show them to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7098.497s">There's</a> one study that we were able to find. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7101.139s">I've</a> asked repeatedly, several people, no one has been able to produce anything but that one study, which is not very conclusive. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7109.745s">So,</a> and just one more thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7113.399s">It</a> has been said, no system is perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7117.14s">This</a> isn't a moral issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7118.921s">This</a> isn't something, there's no perfect system. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7123.483s">So</a> a district system is not gonna be perfect either, but you're willing to ignore your constituents because on the idea that this is some moral issue, that it's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7139.407s">And</a> I don't understand that, because charter review is not easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7144.109s">There</a> are a lot more stops that this charter has to go to after you. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7148.872s">The</a> last one is the voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7152.534s">And</a> people have talked about word representation in the city for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7156.816s">It</a> was the biggest issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7158.657s">When</a> we talked to people, that is what they talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7163.019s">So,</a>  <a

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15005.037s">When</a> the committee discussed Milton McDonald 61 Monument Street, when we discussed referendum, when we were discussing the timelines, we did see them as initiative and referendum as inherently different. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15016.323s">And</a> one of the things that we discussed was that a referendum pauses a measure that was passed by a duly elected body and that it didn't <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15025.901s">that</a> that time frame, we didn't want it to be extended any more than it had to. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15031.464s">So</a> we wanted to give the citizens the right to do it while also making sure that the elected body that passed it wasn't, that the measure wasn't put, held at bay for too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15047.072s">I</a> just wanted to point that out.

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9843.576s">You</a> mean the process of creating the survey?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9854.054s">The</a> feedback we got was that we wanted the survey to be accessible, so not too complicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9862.42s">We</a> asked about major questions that voters are most concerned about, which is the composition, term limits, things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9873.408s">The</a> results are all in the final report. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9875.589s">So,</a> I mean, I can get them, but you all have them, right?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9895.175s">Whether,</a> for council, you're talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9898.115s">Yes,</a> for city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9901.516s">Whether</a> to remain all at large? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9906.81s">to</a> be ward-based, hybrid-based. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9910.654s">I</a> mean, we can't be all ward-based, because we only have eight exclusively ward-based, because we only have eight wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9917.161s">So</a> that's not really an option on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9919.604s">Anyway.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9928.153s">The</a> combining of the wards? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9929.809s">Oh</a> yeah, combining of words or... No, that was something that came up in the discussions about the school committee to address the challenges of making school committee, applying word representation to the school committee, because that would have increased the body size. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9947.567s">I</a> see. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9948.468s">And</a> so that's how that came up.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9991.111s">Well,</a> it's. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9992.854s">very</a> common cities all over the state have a different composition for city council and school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9999.518s">So</a> I think voters can figure it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10003.74s">I</a> mean, they do in most other cities or many other cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10009.624s">You</a> know, I think this is laid out in the final report, but I don't think we saw a call to increase the size of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10019.075s">But</a> we also recognize that the community still wanted board representation for the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10027.858s">I</a> actually was not on the school committee subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10031.68s">And</a> I think when you have that discussion, maybe Paulette Van der Kloot would participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10036.762s">She</a> chaired that subcommittee and they had extensive discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10039.883s">So</a> I would actually prefer to let her speak more about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10042.544s">I</a> can tell you in general, because obviously they came back to the full committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10046.979s">And</a> we then discussed it, so I can tell you more in general, but if you want more specifics of how they reached that, she did give you a more detailed answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10057.829s">But</a> that was the gist of it, was trying to incorporate ward representation without necessarily increasing it to a body of 11, which we felt was appropriate for council, but not for school committee.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10232.927s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10235.667s">they</a> don't collect that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10239.089s">I</a> do just want to say that the discussion about competitiveness, we didn't look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10246.434s">That's</a> not, but what we did look at was representation of the wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10251.778s">And</a> we looked back to 2005 and found that two wards in the city had no Councilor from those wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10262.528s">So</a> they had zero representation and that two wards that those were words one and four and two words two and three had disproportionate representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10270.996s">And</a> in terms of the competitiveness, you know, like I said, we didn't look at that we didn't research it, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10279.364s">I</a> can say anecdotally that in my approximately 30 years living in Medford, I've never seen an incumbent city councilor lose an election, and I wouldn't call that competitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10290.329s">So</a> I just wanted to say that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10318.583s">Yes,</a> we did some of those, and they should be in the final report. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10322.726s">Some</a> of the graphics didn't transition well, and so there's actually a new version on the website, I think, with better graphics that you can check. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10330.631s">But</a> Jean Zotter worked on that a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10333.894s">So</a> if you wanted more details on that, you could speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10337.716s">I</a> don't know if she's on Zoom, but she collected a lot of that information and presented it.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10445.612s">Jean,</a> if you don't mind, if I could just add that one of the reasons, as she mentioned, not everybody gave demographic information, but one of the reasons we chose to collect it was so that we could try to do outreach to populations that we didn't get as many responses from. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10461.538s">And</a> Jean was an amazing organizer of listening sessions around the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10467.7s">And</a> we tried to go and we, I mean, it's all in the final report. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10471.902s">So</a> you can sort of see, but I just wanted to add that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10583.456s">We</a> wanted the charter to succeed with the voters and at the state house. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10590.397s">So</a> we didn't necessarily look at alternatives that aren't used. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10596.339s">Ranked</a> choice voting did come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10601.3s">That</a> is something that we believed would see a hurdle at the state house, especially because Medford during the state question <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10613.69s">voted</a> for ranked choice voting only with a small majority. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10617.014s">So</a> I think, you know, the success of the charter, the ultimate success of the charter was a consideration for us.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10666.193s">Could</a> you just repeat? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10667.053s">I'm</a> not sure I cut that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10690.401s">Yes,</a> we had a spreadsheet of cities in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10695.064s">We</a> didn't look at other states. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10697.306s">We</a> don't know what the interaction of municipal governments with state government is in those states. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10703.89s">There's</a> just so many other factors that could come into play. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10706.571s">So</a> we stuck to Massachusetts.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10765.07s">I</a> believe not. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10768.127s">You</a> know, I don't have it in front of me, so I can't say 100%, but I don't think we did.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10776.891s">To</a> be honest, I mean, just there is a graph in the final report that represents the number of Councilors who ran from each ward and then who won. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10789.596s">So</a> there is information about that in the final report.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10823.713s">I</a> don't think that would be my decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10825.935s">So,</a> I mean, I think that would have to be between you and the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10831.199s">I</a> don't, I mean, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10836.963s">We've</a> officially finished our work, so I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10842.585s">I</a> just don't feel like I can answer that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10851.629s">Possibly.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10883.543s">Well,</a> are you referring to multi—I mean, the— <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10891.068s">Sorry,</a> it's getting late. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10892.349s">The</a> options you talked about before.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10897.353s">So</a> what are you talking about exactly?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10903.757s">Just</a> simply district versus.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10908.14s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10937.329s">But</a> we explained why.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10952.053s">I</a> mean, we wouldn't be the only city that has this configuration with a different configuration for school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10958.695s">Lowell,</a> for instance, has an exact, you know, they have eight wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10963.296s">They</a> have 11 ward Councilors, one from each ward, three at large, and then their school committee is broke down with districts at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10972.482s">And</a> they have a seven-member school committee as well.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10978.846s">I'm</a> just saying it's not unheard of.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11018.226s">I</a> mean, there are timelines also. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11021.328s">So</a> that's something to consider as well.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11207.294s">I'm</a> sorry, of what?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11238.116s">It's</a> the census data.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11275.665s">I</a> feel like that's a question for the Pollen Center, because they have more knowledge about that in general.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11570.842s">We</a> did look at that and we asked, we looked for the research and we asked the Collins Center and we only found <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11577.98s">one</a> study. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11580.121s">If</a> there are more, we didn't find them and we couldn't, the Collins Center didn't know of any either. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11585.905s">And</a> we also mentioned that in the final report that that was the finding that you quoted, but there were also caveats, which included that it was a, it was mostly looked at towns and that more study would be warranted for the kind of <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11608.206s">area,</a> areas like Medford cities, and also that he didn't, the author didn't consider potential benefits of ward representation, including increased diversity. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11620.874s">So</a> it just didn't, it was one study, looked at one thing, and it wasn't a really broad, there wasn't much broad agreement on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11632.443s">and</a> the issues of representation and the potentiality for increased diversity, more accessibility to running for office were just more compelling to us.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14566.52s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14567.061s">Melvin</a> McDonald, 61 Monument Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14570.484s">I</a> want to thank Anthony for speaking and sharing his thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14574.987s">I</a> do just want to say that we all on the committee have different perceptions and different experiences, but we did consider other numbers besides 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14587.317s">I</a> could bore you with the details of that, but I don't feel like I have to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14592.281s">I</a> think it shows up in the minutes of our meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14595.806s">We</a> did not simply only consider 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14602.315s">Other</a> than that, I think we did take a comprehensive look and I think our final report shows that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14608.278s">So</a> I feel like it speaks for itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14612.761s">The</a> one thing that I did wanna point out because there's been talk about voter turnout and numbers were given about voter turnout in particular wards and the wards with low voter turnout correlate directly with the underrepresented wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14628.53s">When</a> candidates run for office, they naturally go where the voters are, so it becomes a, a cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14639.601s">And</a> one of the hopes is that with representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14643.965s">voter</a> turnout could increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14647.587s">So</a> I just wanted to point that out, that the low voter turnout correlates with the underrepresented or zero represented in the last couple of decades' wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14658.973s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-10-05_GqBzZH7qLmA/2024-10-05_GqBzZH7qLmA.html">City Council 06-06-23</a></h2>

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5469.673s">Thank</a> you so much for this presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5471.774s">I</a> think we have a lot to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5475.655s">I</a> have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5479.297s">When</a> you talked in your slides, there was the option of a complete rewrite or revisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5488.24s">And</a> given that we currently have a planned government, if the committee decides we, <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5495.55s">Does</a> that mean we have to decide not to keep the plan and just write a charter that's separate from the plan government? <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5505.476s">Would</a> that qualify as writing a new charter? <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5508.358s">Or</a> if we just want revisions, does that mean we can keep plan A and make revisions to it? <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5516.443s">How</a> would that work, given that we already have a plan government? <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5520.265s">So</a> you could- Go ahead, Mary.<h2><a href="../2024-11-18_PQNVkYiOrIU/2024-11-18_PQNVkYiOrIU.html">City Council 03-22-22</a></h2>
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1240.577s">Milva</a> McDonald, 61 Monument Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1246.621s">Every</a> city has the right to charter review. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1249.439s">You've</a> heard it before and you'll hear it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1252.1s">The</a> charter, the instrument that dictates how our city government is structured and implemented is a living document. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1259.562s">Wisdom</a> and smart governance would dictate periodic review. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1264.324s">Yet</a> Medford's charter has not been looked at for more than three decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1269.146s">That</a> means the last review happened before my 29 years as a resident and has been pointed out here <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1277.14s">before</a> more than one member of this council was even born. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1281.441s">Charter</a> review has been attempted several times, for at least two of those times, the barrier has come from you, the city council, and you are the body that today will determine the fate of another home rule petition to initiate charter review. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1297.446s">I</a> started joining some of my fellow residents a few months ago to organize around the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1304.34s">We</a> contacted each of you to hear your thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1307.481s">To</a> those of you who met and talked with us, thank you for the productive discussions and the chance to listen to your concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1314.984s">Some</a> of you felt the elected charter review commission outlined in this paper might not be representative of all the neighborhoods in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1322.827s">We</a> responded to your specific asks and we got word representation applied to this petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1330.114s">Now,</a> some of you who expressed support have flip-flopped for reasons ranging from complaints about social media comments to declarations that charter review should come from the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1341.221s">First,</a> I would like to say, councillors, you are the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1344.943s">You</a> are our elected officials, and we have spoken to you on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1349.386s">I</a> have here a letter, which I ask to be entered into the record, endorsed by 227 residents, urging you to vote yes on this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1360.641s">In</a> recent years, nearly 5,000 people have signed a petition to get a Charter Review Commission on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1368.963s">That's</a> well over 50% of the entire number of votes each of you received in the last election, and in many cases, it's closer to 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1379.466s">In</a> addition, this paper will put candidates from each ward, as some of you requested, on the ballot to be elected by the people <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1387.57s">to</a> a charter review commission that will engage the community in its 18 month process. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1394.634s">Recommendations</a> for modifications to the charter, if any, would go on the ballot before they could be implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1403.38s">In</a> light of all this, how can you argue that this process would not come from the people? <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1409.744s">I</a> ask that you honor the support you expressed to us and vote in favor of this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1415.563s">While</a> it is not the only route to charter review, it is the most expeditious in the current moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1422.125s">And</a> it offers you a chance to respond to your constituents and show that you value their concerns and you value their civic engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1431.028s">For</a> what better way to promote civic engagement than inviting every resident of this city to join in reviewing how their city government works. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1442.293s">We</a> are determined to partake of that opportunity, indeed of that right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1447.836s">Collecting</a> signatures is not the only other alternative available. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1452.218s">We</a> are exploring all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1454.619s">And</a> if this petition fails, we will pursue them as swiftly and as transparently as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1461.503s">Every</a> city has the right to a review, and we will have ours. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1466.205s">It</a> is up to you to decide whether you will help to honor that right in this moment or choose to delay it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1473.532s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_s4ePTNAg4Nw/2024-11-19_s4ePTNAg4Nw.html">City Council 02-08-22</a></h2>
