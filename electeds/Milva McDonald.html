 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3160.944s">Thank</a> you to the Medford Democratic City Committee, the Library, my fellow candidates, and everyone for coming and tuning in. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3168.807s">I'm</a> Milva McDonald, and the story of why I'm running for City Council starts a long time ago, as a kid growing up with an immigrant working-class mom who came to America from Italy in the 1950s. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3181.813s">She</a> was the hardest worker I've ever known and she passed her work ethic on to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3186.518s">Whether</a> working at the Boston Globe while raising my four kids, sitting on the board of non-profits, or helping launch the Mystic LGBTQ plus youth support network, I have always put in the hard work required to get things done. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3200.17s">A</a> few years ago, I decided charter review needed to get done in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3204.715s">In</a> 2021, I convened a group of residents to pursue options, and in late 2022, at our request, Mayor Breanna Lungo-Koehn formed the Medford Charter Study Committee and appointed me as chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3218.568s">For</a> two years, I led our 11-member committee in a comprehensive review of our city's foundational document. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3225.432s">As</a> a result, for the first time in 40 years, a new charter is projected to be on your municipal ballot this November. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3234.396s">My</a> experience chairing the committee inspired me to run for office. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3238.799s">I</a> want to bring the same level of research, outreach, and deep listening to the work of being your city councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3247.485s">My</a> priorities include growing the city's tax base through zoning, reviewing fee structures, and fighting for a better pilot agreement with Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3256.287s">Addressing</a> the affordable housing crisis is a necessity. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3259.508s">We</a> must support the Affordable Housing Trust and the Community Land Trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3264.109s">To</a> ease the burden on taxpayers and renters, we should explore a residential exemption for owner-occupied homes and look further at the good landlord tax credit. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3274.211s">We</a> need to ensure that we are meeting the goals in the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan, which continues to safeguard Medford for the future while improving life now. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3285.279s">Medford</a> has great cultural organizations, but I believe the arts need an anchor at City Hall, so I support the installation of a City Arts Coordinator. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3295.567s">As</a> councillor, I would also work to create a commission to promote visibility, equality, and empowerment of our LGBTQ plus community. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3305.275s">I</a> think it's also the job of municipal officials to support our dedicated city staff and those in need, like seniors on fixed incomes and immigrant communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3314.983s">I</a> love people, hearing their concerns and stories, and doing my best to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3319.767s">As</a> a second-generation Italian-American with working-class roots, I will always put in the time, effort, and research needed to get the job done, and I will make responsiveness and respect priorities in all my interactions. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3335.18s">I'm</a> excited to get to work to make our beloved city an even better place to live, and I ask for your vote in September and November. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3343.768s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-09-16_DvAYwvDCXNU/2025-09-16_DvAYwvDCXNU.html">Medford Happenings Episode 23   Milva McDonald 08 20 25</a></h2>
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=101.044s">Thank</a> you, and thanks for inviting me. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=103.105s">I'm</a> excited to be here.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=118.677s">Well,</a> I'm Milva McDonald, and I've lived in Medford for about 32 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=124.482s">I've</a> been in my current home in West Medford for about 25 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=130.407s">I</a> had several, three decades, I worked in journalism at the Boston Globe in the calendar section, if anybody remembers that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=140.555s">That</a> was a great section. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=141.476s">LS.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=141.596s">It</a> was. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=142.097s">It</a> was great. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=143.959s">I</a> also worked in the Globe West and Northwest and then eventually Boston.com. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=151.166s">Now</a> I work for a publicist, a very niche publicist. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=154.51s">We</a> promote exclusively jazz musicians. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=158.013s">I</a> also do some teaching and tutoring. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=161.477s">I</a> have some students. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=163.159s">I</a> homeschooled all four of my kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=165.343s">So,</a> and during that time, I co-founded a secular nonprofit called Advocates for Home Education in Massachusetts, which is still thriving. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=177.86s">And</a> I'm also a writer. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=179.021s">I've</a> written a couple of books about homeschooling. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=181.483s">I've</a> written short stories that I've had published in various journals. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=186.027s">I</a> also love music. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=187.529s">I</a> sing in three choruses, one called the Holla Lisa Singers. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=191.693s">And</a> the director of that chorus lives right here in Medford also. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=196.017s">And</a> I just sang in the Harvard Summer Chorus. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=198.079s">That</a> was great fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=199.48s">And</a> another chorus called Mutamonia. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=202.442s">I</a> also am a potter. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=204.363s">I</a> took up pottery a couple of years ago, and I absolutely love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=209.744s">So</a> you can see me at craft fairs around Medford this fall.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=214.086s">And</a> I also have a few things at the gift shop at Arts Collaborative Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=217.547s">Oh,</a> okay, that's wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=219.147s">That's</a> a great background. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=220.468s">A</a> lot of experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=221.988s">Yeah,</a> and I said I have four kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=223.609s">I</a> also have three grandkids.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=246.096s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=248.118s">Well,</a> giving back to the community has always been important to me and I've always been a hard worker. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=252.761s">I</a> kind of got my work ethic from my mom. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=256.544s">She</a> was an Italian immigrant who came to the United States in the 1950s. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=261.467s">at</a> the age of 27. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=262.087s">It</a> was quite the culture shock for her. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=266.909s">She</a> had really never been 10 miles out of her village until that point and now she's in this country experiencing running water, electricity, heat for the very first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=280.595s">So</a> my Italian heritage and my experience as the daughter of a working class immigrant sort of contribute to who I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=289.684s">And</a> my views on the importance of listening, tolerance, empathy, things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=297.172s">So</a> that's sort of a background. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=299.314s">But</a> I also really like to get things done. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=302.669s">And</a> a few years ago, I decided that I'd been hearing about charter review in the city for a very long time, and I thought, I really would like to see this get done. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=315.6s">So</a> in 2021, I kind of just rallied people and said, <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=320.965s">hey,</a> I'm going to invite everybody over, talk about charter review. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=324.969s">And</a> some people that had been involved in the past, like Jim Silva and a couple of other people, we got together, we sort of brought, we created a group called the Medford Charter Review Coalition. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=339.099s">And</a> we were pursuing different ways to get charter review done. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=342.803s">We</a> said we're just going to try everything and we were collecting signatures. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=347.288s">But</a> we also learned that one of the ways and which is actually the most common way for charter review to get done in Massachusetts is for a city committee to be appointed. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=360.303s">And</a> then that committee would do the work of the review and then it would go through the city government and then to the state house and back to the voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=369.315s">So</a> we approached the mayor and said, would you please form a committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=374.422s">And</a> she did. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=376.282s">And</a> to my honor, I was appointed chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=379.304s">Initially,</a> I was co-chair with Laurel Siegel, but then she left to work in the city's planning department. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=387.81s">And</a> we spent, we started in about, I think it was like November or December of 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=394.434s">We</a> finished up in late 2024, and I chaired the 11-member committee, and we dove into all things charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=402.339s">We</a> talked about <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=404.22s">Charters</a> from around the state, we prioritize public engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=409.163s">So</a> my experience chairing that committee, learning about local government and listening and talking to residents just really inspired me to stay involved with the city council run. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=419.51s">I'd</a> like to bring that same level of research and depth and listening to the city council.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=472.803s">It</a> was, you know, before the committee was formed, you know, I was focused on we got to get this charter review done and then it was really a big shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=484.115s">It</a> was like, oh, okay, we got the review because there was just so, it was so long in Medford just to get the review to happen before anybody could really start talking about, okay, now what, you know, what about the actual charter? <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=496.747s">So</a> it was a shift, but we did have help. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=500.913s">We</a> had the Collins Center for Public Management, which is a nonprofit out of UMass Boston that helps a lot of municipalities with this kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=510.525s">So</a> that was very important to have that help. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=516.131s">And,</a> you know, with their guidance we started looking at charters from around the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=522.033s">We</a> had a template, a modern charter template that the Collins Center provided for us so we could sort of see, you know, what are the elements that are in a modern charter, which of course our current charter very much lacks. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=539.579s">And</a> it was very important to us to do a lot of public engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=544.701s">So</a> we held three public information sessions at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=549.263s">We</a> created a survey that we distributed in five languages. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=554.145s">And</a> we held over a dozen listening sessions around the city, which were great. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=561.55s">We</a> worked with different organizations like Housing Medford, the Chamber of Commerce, Medford Family Network. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=568.534s">We</a> went to the West Medford Community Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=570.735s">We</a> just tried to cover as much ground as we could. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=574.643s">And</a> we sort of collected all this feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=578.725s">And</a> that was one of my favorite parts of the process was, you know, the listening sessions and talking to people and sort of listening to their thoughts and what they wanted to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=589.65s">And</a> once we had this gathered, we sort of dug in. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=594.452s">And</a> then we went through the charter article by article. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=598.614s">It's</a> a lot of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=599.835s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=600.795s">We</a> did create subcommittees. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=603.956s">So</a> that was pretty helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=606.797s">So</a> the subcommittee would like go in depth on a particular article and then bring it back to the whole committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=613.36s">The</a> Collins Center helped a lot with the drafting, but I think our committee was actually pretty ambitious and we did draft several of the sections on our own. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=624.344s">And</a> one of the important goals was getting it on the ballot this fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=630.186s">So</a> in order to make that, <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=632.167s">timeline</a> we were working really hard at the end.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=636.052s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=638.034s">And</a> then once we finished our final report, yeah, once we sort of hashed everything out, incorporated the feedback, we looked at studies and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=650.648s">Then</a> we put it all together in a final report, submitted it to the mayor, and then she reviewed it and sent it to the council, and then it did get to the statehouse. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=662.019s">And</a> it is projected to be on the ballot, which I'm very excited about.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=666.423s">That</a> was going to be my... Everything I hear is that it is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=670.327s">It</a> just had its... <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=673.73s">third</a> reading with the House. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=675.17s">It's</a> gone through the, it's almost through the Senate, so it should be at the Governor's desk very, very soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=680.771s">That's</a> what I hear.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=684.492s">And</a> I just want to, again, thank every member of the Charter Committee, because it was a lot of work, and people really donated their time, and we had a lot of fun, too.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=747.117s">Well,</a> they proposed an alternate scheme of district representation which would have resulted in a majority at large council. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=758.885s">I</a> knew that they would look at it and there was an expectation that there would be changes made. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=764.128s">That</a> particular change, I was a bit surprised at because we didn't really have indication from many of the council members that that would be their view. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=774.575s">Um,</a> and the other thing that I was mostly concerned because if there was one thing that we heard over and over again in our public engagement piece, um, it was ward representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=789.562s">please</a> give the city ward representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=791.503s">So</a> it was very clear that that was what people wanted. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=796.266s">And,</a> you know, knowing through the process, we learned about charter reviews in other cities and, you know, charter review isn't always guaranteed to succeed. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=805.852s">And</a> often charter review will hinge on kind of like one major issue for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=811.476s">For</a> instance, in Medford, there actually was a charter commission in 1978. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=817.605s">that</a> created a charter that got voted down. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=821.247s">And</a> the big issue then was mayor versus city manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=825.829s">And</a> that particular charter commission didn't recommend that and the voters said no thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=831.151s">And</a> then in 1986 the voters did get the switch to the plan A mayor and replacing the city manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=841.176s">So</a> to my mind the big issue that I heard from most people in the city, <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=847.033s">was</a> word representation and it didn't surprise me because before the committee even, it was something that I had been hearing about. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=854.024s">So,</a> you know, I felt like, <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=860.028s">Just</a> look, I tried to speak to the council about our findings. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=867.478s">Statistically,</a> we are one of the only cities in Massachusetts to not have ward representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=873.805s">Our</a> council is the smallest in the state for a city of our size. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=881.433s">It's</a> 9 or 11 is the standard size. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=884.355s">And</a> with the new charter we would have 11, 8 ward and 3 at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=889.357s">And</a> I was also, in my mind was also the ultimate goal of success at the ballot box. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=894.76s">And</a> I felt like that was an important piece for that to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=898.902s">I</a> think it resulted in a good public discussion where the merits and the challenges of ward representation were discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=907.326s">It</a> was good to see people coming out to share their views communicate with the council and the mayor and I was just very glad that in the end that the council reached a compromise with the mayor that kept ward representation for council and I just want to reiterate that what you were actually doing was This is what the people want
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=936.752s">I</a> mean, you know, and there was sort of, some people countered that with, well, we don't know what the people want. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=942.417s">There's</a> 60,000 people in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=944.018s">And</a> that is true, but we have to base it on what we were hearing from people.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=953.406s">And</a> that's what we did.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=957.169s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=989.935s">Yeah,</a> it was great. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=991.917s">I</a> mean, there were some, like some people say, well, you didn't listen to the people on everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=997.662s">For</a> instance, the mayor being on school committee, which became, I mean, that in the end, that was part of the compromise made between the mayor and the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1007.509s">And,</a> you know, what we did as a committee was we did take that public engagement very seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1013.111s">But</a> we also talked to, I mean, we talked to almost every sitting elected. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1019.394s">We</a> talked to prior electeds. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1021.075s">We</a> talked to prior mayors. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1022.675s">We</a> talked to city staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1026.096s">And</a> we looked at a lot of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1028.257s">And</a> the school committee subcommittee, which was chaired by Paulette Van der Kloot, looked very carefully <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1035.3s">chair,</a> mayor being the chair, and you know, there were various reasons that the committee decided to recommend that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1043.729s">It</a> was changed, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1046.913s">You</a> know, term limits was another one, because term limits are very popular, but when we dug into the data, <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1056.52s">It</a> just, it didn't make sense for various reasons to recommend it for council and school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1062.963s">We</a> did recommend it for mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1065.384s">But</a> I never heard the council complain about the fact that we didn't, well, there was one time actually, once they complained. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1074.529s">But,</a> you know, I mean, we did our best. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1078.39s">We</a> took the public engagement seriously, but we also had other information that we incorporated.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1097.969s">Well,</a> I hope everyone votes yes.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1104.695s">And</a> I just want to say one of the really important things in the new charter, if everybody votes yes and it gets voted through, is that we will have regular charter review. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1113.602s">So</a> we will not go for decades with our charter languishing again.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1138.474s">We</a> did our best.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1171.61s">So</a> my position is that the city does need a zoning overhaul. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1176.491s">There's</a> not really a question and I don't think there's disagreement about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1181.152s">I</a> think that there's been a lot of work done and we have these sort of visionary documents that have been guiding the process like the comprehensive plan and the housing production plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1193.895s">And</a> we've had 18 months with an outside consultant. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1196.456s">So</a> a lot has been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1199.076s">But</a> based on my conversation with residents and watching the community development board meetings, I think that slowing things down, especially with the residential zoning, was the right call. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1211.099s">The</a> good news is that people are learning about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1214.88s">They</a> know about it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1216.72s">For</a> whatever reason that didn't happen, I prefer to look forward and look at the sort of the upside of that, which is that now we actually are hearing from people. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1228.487s">And</a> they will have a chance to share specifics about their neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1233.169s">And</a> I think that's important because, you know, the consultants have done their best, but they don't know every neighborhood in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1239.773s">So,</a> now that we have residents aware and on board, they can share specifics about their neighborhood with the community development board and the council, and that can help guide the process to a good final outcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1256.533s">I</a> think that... <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1259.646s">That</a> kind of detailed attention is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1261.668s">We</a> also have to give that detailed attention to the squares and corridors. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1266.053s">I</a> know the Community Development Board is working really hard on everything that's been sent over to them, which is a lot.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1272.46s">Yeah,</a> it's a tremendous amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1277.685s">And</a> I think it's probably prudent <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1280.563s">to</a> take the time that it needs and look at details. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1284.605s">Like</a> right now, I know one of the things they talked about at their last meeting was the boundaries of the squares, for instance. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1290.787s">I</a> mean, that was a question that I asked a month or two ago, because I noticed that in my neighborhood, <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1299.546s">the</a> boundaries of the squares had been stretched so that some really beautiful old residential houses were potentially going to be zoned to mixed use. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1309.873s">And</a> so they're looking at those kinds of properties and those kinds of things and those details. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1316.638s">And</a> I think that that's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1319.479s">So</a> I'm glad that that's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1322.221s">One</a> of the things that residents that I've talked to have been concerned about, several, is <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1327.785s">Teardowns</a> in their neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1329.486s">Yes,</a> and we have already seen yes, you know a house in South Medford That's slated to be torn down That's a beautiful perfectly wonderful house. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1342.433s">So</a> and and people are worried about things like that so those those are some of the concerns I've heard and and <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1351.543s">What</a> I don't see disagreement on is I don't see disagreement on the need for new zoning and the need for new housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1358.932s">We</a> particularly need commercial zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1362.736s">So</a> I think that the good news is that I think most everybody in the city agrees that this is important.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1371.526s">And</a> that it needs to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1373.727s">I</a> don't think that anybody's trying to stop rezoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1378.111s">I</a> think it's just let's make sure that we're listening to people and figuring out what's really the best for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1388.538s">What</a> is the right zoning for Medford?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1473.772s">Yeah,</a> no, that's a that's an excellent question. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1476.233s">And</a> it's a very important question. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1478.874s">It's</a> also a tough question because we have limited options, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1482.415s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1483.536s">I</a> think what we were just talking about zoning, particularly in the commercial sectors, is is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1491.399s">I</a> mean, that's maybe one of the biggest things we can do is to make Medford business friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1501.182s">with</a> the zoning process, looking at permitting processes, incentives, things like that, so that we can grow our commercial tax base. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1510.167s">We</a> have a lot of potential for that, and it just needs to be realized. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1517.911s">State</a> aid and grants, identifying opportunities, I think the planning department works hard at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1524.695s">But</a> that's something that, you know, the council could conceivably work with them on, is identifying those kinds of opportunities and making them happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1539.525s">We</a> should be doing regular reviews of our fee schedules. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1544.028s">Like,</a> we just, parking fees were just looked at, and I know some people might not like that, but our parking fees are very low. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1552.894s">You</a> know, I personally will, you know, look and say, okay, well, will I get the same number of permits this year? <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1561.638s">You</a> know, I don't know if I will. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1563.759s">But</a> I might. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1564.96s">But,</a> I mean, everybody will have to weigh that decision, but things like, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1572.924s">Permitting</a> fees just every and also looking at our contracts like I mean even the shovel year, which is amazing It's also Been a great business opportunity and it's proven to be highly successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1588.348s">So</a> maybe renegotiating some of these contracts where we have now a proven track record and <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1595.309s">And</a> also, I know that this is something that's being looked at, but linkage fees, developer fees, so basically looking at fees, looking at opportunities for state grants, beefing up our commercial sectors, and renegotiating the pilot program with Tufts, looking at, you know, where we can, so those are some of the ways I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1620.738s">They're</a> all good ones.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1660.09s">I</a> am a proponent of affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1662.512s">Um,</a> and I, I think that it's great that this, that we have an affordable housing trust now. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1668.395s">Um,</a> then we need to figure out how to fund it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1670.976s">And</a> we have, uh, the affordable housing trust has a board that put out recently a great comprehensive report with ideas for that, including a community land trust, which I think would also be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1681.662s">That</a> would be, um, like sort of a city owned property that would be available to, <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1689.485s">Build</a> affordable housing on so and that would stay affordable, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1693.446s">No,</a> it'd be nice a city-owned. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1695.446s">Yeah,</a> I mean that's So I think that's those are important. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1699.367s">So</a> and and also in the affordability issue I think looking at a residential exemption for taxpayers for homeowners would be a good thing to investigate Other cities have that Malden has it.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1715.051s">And</a> that is basically where if you live in your property, then you are eligible to apply for an exemption to your tax bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1725.517s">I</a> think that climate resiliency is important, and we have a great climate action and adaptation plan, so I think keeping an eye on that and making sure we're meeting the benchmarks is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1736.503s">I</a> think a lot of great things have already happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1739.545s">Expanding</a> the tree canopy, and these things are great for climate resiliency, but they also improve people's quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1746.669s">So</a> the tree canopy is going to make a nicer city. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1750.251s">The</a> bike share program, I think, has been great for people. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1756.575s">And</a> I think safe streets are important, so infrastructure improvements, things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1765.042s">And</a> I also am a big supporter of the arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1770.367s">I</a> would like to, as a Councilor, advocate for the installation of a city arts coordinator. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1777.032s">One</a> of the things that I hear from people is we have so many great arts organizations, and we do.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1784.158s">I</a> agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1784.738s">Yeah,</a> we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1786.119s">But</a> part of sort of what happens is we don't, you know, the people are picking up the slack, kind of. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1793.082s">So</a> a city arts coordinator could be kind of a unifying, an anchor, basically. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1797.484s">Right,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1799.165s">And</a> support the arts council and sort of unify arts in the city So I and that's what I've heard from the arts community that that's something that they would like nice Um, and I also would like to advocate for an lgbtq plus commission Okay, which would be um, just a you know, one of another one of the city's volunteer commissions, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1820.286s">um</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1820.806s">to</a> sort of advocate for that community. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1823.388s">So</a> those are some of the things.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1847.249s">Okay,</a> I have a couple of really fun ones coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1849.97s">I</a> love music, I said that, and I have musicians in my family, and so there's a couple of events coming up at Mrs. Murphy's, which is the Irish pub on Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1862.353s">on</a> August 29th, which is a Friday, from 6 to 8. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1867.055s">We</a> will be there with Celtic music, a great fiddler named Alistair White, and guitarist Eric McDonald. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1875.998s">Alistair</a> is Scottish, and he used to be in the Battlefield Band, which if anybody knows Celtic music, that's a very big name. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1884.081s">So</a> that's going to be really fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1886.403s">We'll</a> be there from 6 to 8. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1888.364s">Come</a> on over. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1890.146s">Order</a> off the menu. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1891.967s">Chat</a> with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1893.208s">You</a> know, talk to me about my platform. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1895.63s">Get</a> to know me. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1896.21s">I</a> would love to see you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1898.131s">There's</a> another one at Mrs. Murphy's on September 7th, which is a Sunday from 3 to 5 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1903.735s">with</a> the Shereem Klezmer duo. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1906.618s">And</a> Klezmer music is Eastern European Jewish folk music, and it's really fun.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1913.062s">That</a> will be a clarinet player and an accordion player, both who live in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1917.907s">Yeah,</a> so I'm excited about those. <a href="https://youtu.be/DvAYwvDCXNU&t=1919.228s">Very</a> nice, very nice.

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8752.435s">No,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8761.232s">I</a> believe it's Yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8762.712s">I</a> mean, I think the house next to it is also zoned as mixed use too.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8792.327s">Yeah,</a> this one's not because I know who lives there and I've been in it many times.<h2><a href="../2025-06-26_EO-vAhUJAKo/2025-06-26_EO-vAhUJAKo.html">Zoning Q&A/Info Session - Medford Square 05-08-25</a></h2>

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6748.906s">Yeah,</a> like what Zach earlier was saying how, you know, if you look and see, oh, nine stories can go up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6756.717s">with</a> the incentive and you live near it and you're freaked out about that, it might not necessarily be true because there's other factors that would prevent that from going up.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6856.016s">No,</a> I think the map is awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/EO-vAhUJAKo&t=6857.297s">Thank</a> you so much.

<a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6907.674s">There</a> was a lot of things said about the committee, so I just want to address a few of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6911.499s">I</a> may have misunderstood, but I thought I heard someone say that the Charter Study Committee left information out of the survey that we didn't want <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6921.952s">to</a> include. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6923.013s">So</a> if I misunderstood that, I would like, please correct me. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6926.994s">But</a> I would just want to say, if you have that impression, please come and talk to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6932.537s">Because</a> as far as I know, it is absolutely not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6936.258s">I</a> also just wanted to say, and this has been said before, district representation was not asked about because it does not happen in Massachusetts on city councils. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6946.563s">And</a> there have been references by Councilors to communities that have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6949.924s">And</a> I would love to hear the names of them other than Boston and Worcester. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6954.225s">Boston</a> is essentially not comparable. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6957.106s">State</a> law even separates it out from other municipalities. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6962.207s">And</a> Worcester is the second largest city in the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6964.748s">So</a> I am truly interested in hearing about the other communities that have it on city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6971.01s">Ward</a> representation has a definition that is understood. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6975.831s">People</a> know what it means. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6977.632s">So</a> when all of you ran on it, that's what they understood. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6981.115s">When</a> all of you have said for five years, 100% in favor of ward representation, when you said to us in interviews that you were in favor of ward representation, everybody knew what you meant. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6995.867s">So</a> the reason it wasn't asked was because it wasn't on our radar, because it's not really done. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7000.93s">When</a> the school committee subcommittee started digging in, they found that it is, there are a few school committees that have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7008.594s">And</a> I won't go into the, I've said it before, it's in the final report, why it was considered to school committee, but not city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7017.34s">I</a> also wanna say, this is not like the Senate. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7021.142s">The</a> problem with the Senate of our country is that you have senators who represent very small numbers of people and others who represent massive numbers of people who have the same power. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7036.027s">each</a> ward representative would represent the same number of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7040.99s">So</a> you may have a problem with the fact that some wards have low voter turnout and ward three that has high voter turnout has had a disproportionate number of representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7052.117s">And</a> I personally don't think that's an accident, but please don't say it's like the Senate because it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7060.807s">The</a> demographic research that has been done is great, but the demographics will change. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7067.072s">And</a> this charter is going to be in place for, if it passes, for at least 12 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7072.577s">If</a> you're confident that the demographics are going to be exactly the same and the district method will serve, will fix whatever you think ward representation won't, <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7083.386s">That</a> makes sense, but I don't think, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7086.909s">I</a> don't think any of us think that demographics are gonna stay the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7089.991s">The</a> housing studies that have been mentioned, we also addressed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7094.654s">If</a> there are more, I want to see them. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7096.916s">Please</a> show them to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7098.497s">There's</a> one study that we were able to find. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7101.139s">I've</a> asked repeatedly, several people, no one has been able to produce anything but that one study, which is not very conclusive. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7109.745s">So,</a> and just one more thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7113.399s">It</a> has been said, no system is perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7117.14s">This</a> isn't a moral issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7118.921s">This</a> isn't something, there's no perfect system. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7123.483s">So</a> a district system is not gonna be perfect either, but you're willing to ignore your constituents because on the idea that this is some moral issue, that it's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7139.407s">And</a> I don't understand that, because charter review is not easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7144.109s">There</a> are a lot more stops that this charter has to go to after you. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7148.872s">The</a> last one is the voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7152.534s">And</a> people have talked about word representation in the city for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7156.816s">It</a> was the biggest issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7158.657s">When</a> we talked to people, that is what they talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7163.019s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7165.59s">I</a> don't understand why you would abandon that when you have all supported it in the past and your constituents are asking you for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7174.914s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15005.037s">When</a> the committee discussed Milton McDonald 61 Monument Street, when we discussed referendum, when we were discussing the timelines, we did see them as initiative and referendum as inherently different. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15016.323s">And</a> one of the things that we discussed was that a referendum pauses a measure that was passed by a duly elected body and that it didn't <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15025.901s">that</a> that time frame, we didn't want it to be extended any more than it had to. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15031.464s">So</a> we wanted to give the citizens the right to do it while also making sure that the elected body that passed it wasn't, that the measure wasn't put, held at bay for too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15047.072s">I</a> just wanted to point that out.

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9854.054s">The</a> feedback we got was that we wanted the survey to be accessible, so not too complicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9862.42s">We</a> asked about major questions that voters are most concerned about, which is the composition, term limits, things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9873.408s">The</a> results are all in the final report. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9875.589s">So,</a> I mean, I can get them, but you all have them, right?

No, that was something that came up in the discussions about the school committee to address the challenges of making school committee, applying word representation to the school committee, because that would have increased the body size. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9947.567s">I</a> see. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9948.468s">And</a> so that's how that came up.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9991.111s">Well,</a> it's. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9992.854s">very</a> common cities all over the state have a different composition for city council and school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9999.518s">So</a> I think voters can figure it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10003.74s">I</a> mean, they do in most other cities or many other cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10009.624s">You</a> know, I think this is laid out in the final report, but I don't think we saw a call to increase the size of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10019.075s">But</a> we also recognize that the community still wanted board representation for the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10027.858s">I</a> actually was not on the school committee subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10031.68s">And</a> I think when you have that discussion, maybe Paulette Van der Kloot would participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10036.762s">She</a> chaired that subcommittee and they had extensive discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10039.883s">So</a> I would actually prefer to let her speak more about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10042.544s">I</a> can tell you in general, because obviously they came back to the full committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10046.979s">And</a> we then discussed it, so I can tell you more in general, but if you want more specifics of how they reached that, she did give you a more detailed answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10057.829s">But</a> that was the gist of it, was trying to incorporate ward representation without necessarily increasing it to a body of 11, which we felt was appropriate for council, but not for school committee.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10232.927s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10235.667s">they</a> don't collect that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10239.089s">I</a> do just want to say that the discussion about competitiveness, we didn't look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10246.434s">That's</a> not, but what we did look at was representation of the wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10251.778s">And</a> we looked back to 2005 and found that two wards in the city had no Councilor from those wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10262.528s">So</a> they had zero representation and that two wards that those were words one and four and two words two and three had disproportionate representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10270.996s">And</a> in terms of the competitiveness, you know, like I said, we didn't look at that we didn't research it, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10279.364s">I</a> can say anecdotally that in my approximately 30 years living in Medford, I've never seen an incumbent city councilor lose an election, and I wouldn't call that competitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10290.329s">So</a> I just wanted to say that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10318.583s">Yes,</a> we did some of those, and they should be in the final report. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10322.726s">Some</a> of the graphics didn't transition well, and so there's actually a new version on the website, I think, with better graphics that you can check. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10330.631s">But</a> Jean Zotter worked on that a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10333.894s">So</a> if you wanted more details on that, you could speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10337.716s">I</a> don't know if she's on Zoom, but she collected a lot of that information and presented it.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10445.612s">Jean,</a> if you don't mind, if I could just add that one of the reasons, as she mentioned, not everybody gave demographic information, but one of the reasons we chose to collect it was so that we could try to do outreach to populations that we didn't get as many responses from. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10461.538s">And</a> Jean was an amazing organizer of listening sessions around the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10467.7s">And</a> we tried to go and we, I mean, it's all in the final report. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10471.902s">So</a> you can sort of see, but I just wanted to add that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10583.456s">We</a> wanted the charter to succeed with the voters and at the state house. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10590.397s">So</a> we didn't necessarily look at alternatives that aren't used. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10596.339s">Ranked</a> choice voting did come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10601.3s">That</a> is something that we believed would see a hurdle at the state house, especially because Medford during the state question <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10613.69s">voted</a> for ranked choice voting only with a small majority. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10617.014s">So</a> I think, you know, the success of the charter, the ultimate success of the charter was a consideration for us.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10666.193s">Could</a> you just repeat? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10667.053s">I'm</a> not sure I cut that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10690.401s">Yes,</a> we had a spreadsheet of cities in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10695.064s">We</a> didn't look at other states. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10697.306s">We</a> don't know what the interaction of municipal governments with state government is in those states. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10703.89s">There's</a> just so many other factors that could come into play. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10706.571s">So</a> we stuck to Massachusetts.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10765.07s">I</a> believe not. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10768.127s">You</a> know, I don't have it in front of me, so I can't say 100%, but I don't think we did.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10776.891s">To</a> be honest, I mean, just there is a graph in the final report that represents the number of Councilors who ran from each ward and then who won. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10789.596s">So</a> there is information about that in the final report.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10823.713s">I</a> don't think that would be my decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10825.935s">So,</a> I mean, I think that would have to be between you and the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10831.199s">I</a> don't, I mean, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10836.963s">We've</a> officially finished our work, so I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10842.585s">I</a> just don't feel like I can answer that.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10851.629s">Possibly.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10883.543s">Well,</a> are you referring to multi—I mean, the— <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10891.068s">Sorry,</a> it's getting late. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10892.349s">The</a> options you talked about before.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10897.353s">So</a> what are you talking about exactly?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10903.757s">Just</a> simply district versus.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10908.14s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10937.329s">But</a> we explained why.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10952.053s">I</a> mean, we wouldn't be the only city that has this configuration with a different configuration for school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10958.695s">Lowell,</a> for instance, has an exact, you know, they have eight wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10963.296s">They</a> have 11 ward Councilors, one from each ward, three at large, and then their school committee is broke down with districts at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10972.482s">And</a> they have a seven-member school committee as well.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10978.846s">I'm</a> just saying it's not unheard of.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11018.226s">I</a> mean, there are timelines also. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11021.328s">So</a> that's something to consider as well.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11207.294s">I'm</a> sorry, of what?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11238.116s">It's</a> the census data.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11275.665s">I</a> feel like that's a question for the Pollen Center, because they have more knowledge about that in general.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11570.842s">We</a> did look at that and we asked, we looked for the research and we asked the Collins Center and we only found <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11577.98s">one</a> study. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11580.121s">If</a> there are more, we didn't find them and we couldn't, the Collins Center didn't know of any either. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11585.905s">And</a> we also mentioned that in the final report that that was the finding that you quoted, but there were also caveats, which included that it was a, it was mostly looked at towns and that more study would be warranted for the kind of <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11608.206s">area,</a> areas like Medford cities, and also that he didn't, the author didn't consider potential benefits of ward representation, including increased diversity. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11620.874s">So</a> it just didn't, it was one study, looked at one thing, and it wasn't a really broad, there wasn't much broad agreement on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11632.443s">and</a> the issues of representation and the potentiality for increased diversity, more accessibility to running for office were just more compelling to us.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14566.52s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14567.061s">Melvin</a> McDonald, 61 Monument Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14570.484s">I</a> want to thank Anthony for speaking and sharing his thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14574.987s">I</a> do just want to say that we all on the committee have different perceptions and different experiences, but we did consider other numbers besides 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14587.317s">I</a> could bore you with the details of that, but I don't feel like I have to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14592.281s">I</a> think it shows up in the minutes of our meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14595.806s">We</a> did not simply only consider 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14602.315s">Other</a> than that, I think we did take a comprehensive look and I think our final report shows that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14608.278s">So</a> I feel like it speaks for itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14612.761s">The</a> one thing that I did wanna point out because there's been talk about voter turnout and numbers were given about voter turnout in particular wards and the wards with low voter turnout correlate directly with the underrepresented wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14628.53s">When</a> candidates run for office, they naturally go where the voters are, so it becomes a, a cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14639.601s">And</a> one of the hopes is that with representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14643.965s">voter</a> turnout could increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14647.587s">So</a> I just wanted to point that out, that the low voter turnout correlates with the underrepresented or zero represented in the last couple of decades' wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=14658.973s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-10-05_GqBzZH7qLmA/2024-10-05_GqBzZH7qLmA.html">City Council 06-06-23</a></h2>

 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=2138.463s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=2139.163s">So</a> I'm going to hand over the program to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=2141.985s">And</a> I know that you all are interested in connecting with the committee members and you can start your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=2151.47s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=3502.626s">Does</a> anybody do you want us to just sort of introduce ourselves to start with?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=3543.898s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=3544.438s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=3544.858s">I'll</a> start and then I'll call each committee member and invite you to introduce yourself and comment on some of the things Michael mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=3555.222s">I'm</a> Melva McDonald. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=3556.262s">I'm</a> one of the co-chairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=3558.883s">I've</a> been hearing about charter review in Medford for several years and started to get involved in trying to get a review to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=3568.742s">uh,</a> about a year ago and it's taken, it's taken a while just to get this committee up and going. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=3574.904s">So</a> I'm really excited about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=3577.125s">Um,</a> I think for me, the fundamental issue is what Michael and Anthony and others have alluded to about the charter sort of being the core document that guides the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=3588.308s">Um,</a> and that's my main reason for being interested, um, in, in looking at it and updating it and. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=3597.48s">seeing</a> what would work best for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=3600.202s">So,</a> and Laurel, do you wanna go next?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=3645.731s">Anthony,</a> do you wanna go next?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4030.827s">Mike,</a> do you want to go next?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4353.694s">Matt,</a> do you want to go?
 <p>[Milva McDonald]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5469.673s">Thank</a> you so much for this presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5471.774s">I</a> think we have a lot to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5475.655s">I</a> have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5479.297s">When</a> you talked in your slides, there was the option of a complete rewrite or revisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5488.24s">And</a> given that we currently have a planned government, if the committee decides we, <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5495.55s">Does</a> that mean we have to decide not to keep the plan and just write a charter that's separate from the plan government? <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5505.476s">Would</a> that qualify as writing a new charter? <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5508.358s">Or</a> if we just want revisions, does that mean we can keep plan A and make revisions to it? <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5516.443s">How</a> would that work, given that we already have a plan government? <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5520.265s">So</a> you could- Go ahead, Mary.<h2><a href="../2024-11-18_PQNVkYiOrIU/2024-11-18_PQNVkYiOrIU.html">City Council 03-22-22</a></h2>

<a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1409.744s">I</a> ask that you honor the support you expressed to us and vote in favor of this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1415.563s">While</a> it is not the only route to charter review, it is the most expeditious in the current moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1422.125s">And</a> it offers you a chance to respond to your constituents and show that you value their concerns and you value their civic engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1431.028s">For</a> what better way to promote civic engagement than inviting every resident of this city to join in reviewing how their city government works. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1442.293s">We</a> are determined to partake of that opportunity, indeed of that right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1447.836s">Collecting</a> signatures is not the only other alternative available. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1452.218s">We</a> are exploring all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1454.619s">And</a> if this petition fails, we will pursue them as swiftly and as transparently as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1461.503s">Every</a> city has the right to a review, and we will have ours. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1466.205s">It</a> is up to you to decide whether you will help to honor that right in this moment or choose to delay it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1473.532s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_s4ePTNAg4Nw/2024-11-19_s4ePTNAg4Nw.html">City Council 02-08-22</a></h2>
