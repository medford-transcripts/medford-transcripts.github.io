<a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=7241.195s">They</a> could stay here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=7242.516s">How</a> many of our elderly people, they can't afford these bigger places. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=7246.76s">They</a> could stay in Medford at that price. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=7249.282s">So</a> creating the ADUs is creating housing that is affordable naturally to the people of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=7257.289s">However,</a> if you take that same single family and you now make it a two-family house, <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=7262.473s">I</a> guarantee you, now we're at 1.5 million for the two family, or maybe we'll split it in half, go sell it to two condos, and a million one or a million two apiece. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=7271.518s">None</a> of that is gonna create affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=7273.98s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_TWmAoWQ2xQE/2024-06-01_TWmAoWQ2xQE.html">City Council 04-30-24</a></h2>

 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3680.942s">Through</a> the chair, can I talk to
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3684.403s">Okay,</a> this will help housing, because the universities are part of your housing problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3690.708s">They</a> overcharge for their housing, they don't have enough housing, then their students end up moving into the neighborhoods, then because they're coming from wealthy areas that are willing to pay much more than what the people in Medford can pay, that raises the rents there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3705.639s">Then</a> they double up, they triple up, they quadruple up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3708.621s">If</a> I look to the right side of the room, which I won't, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3711.283s">They</a> all came to Medford because of universities. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3714.126s">They</a> all came to Massachusetts because of universities. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3717.65s">They're</a> coming here, they're staying here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3720.052s">It's</a> increasing the population that is part of the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3723.356s">Not</a> that we don't want you here, but it is part of the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3726.179s">So</a> if the university is gonna benefit, and I do believe Tufts just raised their tuition to $90,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3732.165s">It's</a> not about the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3733.466s">It's</a> the fact that they're increasing the cost of housing just by being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3737.59s">Mayor</a> Menino was able to do a lot with the universities in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3741.614s">Harvard</a> went to the city of Cambridge and they came up with a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3745.598s">Cambridge</a> is benefiting from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3747.28s">I'd</a> like to see Medford benefit on the housing end too. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3750.002s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3767.847s">When</a> you look at the cost of housing and where the highest costs of being paid from, they're not from the people that have been here all their lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3775.093s">The</a> people that have been here aren't being able to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3778.196s">People</a> are coming in, they're getting wonderful degrees. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3780.918s">The</a> companies are coming in to get the young graduates. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3783.84s">They're</a> getting great jobs and they can afford to pay more than what most people are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3788.244s">Unfortunately,</a> we have a lot of elderly people. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3790.746s">that</a> need to go into housing, they're being told they need to wait five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3795.872s">There</a> is a huge housing crisis, the university is a part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3798.775s">In</a> regards to Harvard University, they went to the city of Cambridge with a plan back in 2000, which I don't have all the statistics right in front of me because I didn't plan on going there tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3808.525s">However,</a> they helped the city of Cambridge produce and keep <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3814.11s">2600</a> affordable units. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3816.912s">They</a> don't give them money, they help leverage them the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3821.334s">That</a> would be great if Tufts did that for Medford, that could help Medford, that would be a partnership. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3826.496s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_X875ms8gt_4/2024-06-01_X875ms8gt_4.html">City Council 04-02-24</a></h2>

<a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14119.412s">I</a> had an 81-year-old lady ask me the other day, Cal, I give you my proxy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14123.256s">Do</a> you need me to sign it? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14124.797s">No,</a> I don't need you to sign it, but I will go. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14128.421s">All</a> of these people, they need a voice, but they don't have a voice here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14133.987s">They</a> don't feel like they can walk in the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14136.91s">When</a> we talk about trust, that <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14140.413s">You're</a> just asking for a discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14143.237s">That's</a> what we heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14144.258s">President</a> beer is the night of the transfer tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14146.941s">You</a> said we're only here to open a discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14151.067s">That's</a> what you said. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14153.837s">Councilor</a> Lazzaro wrote a blog. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14156.718s">We</a> are crafting this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14159.599s">We</a> voted to craft a transfer fee ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14163.721s">We</a> only have a new discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14165.222s">Are</a> we crafting an ordinance? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14167.122s">That's</a> a big question. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14168.843s">You</a> are doing things differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14171.424s">Never</a> ever in the history of the city of Medford have I seen more than <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14175.926s">The</a> council work on three or four different things, and they're usually things to improve the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14181.49s">They're</a> not things to change the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14184.092s">I've</a> never seen so many housing issues in front of a local city council, we have three branches of government because every branch has different resources, different funds <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14196.658s">in</a> access to different specialized people. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14200.182s">I</a> asked a couple of state representatives and a couple of state senators. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14204.407s">If</a> a housing issue comes into your house, what do you do with it? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14210.074s">We</a> put aside money, we send it for a study. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14213.017s">They</a> send it out to other people. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14216.041s">that</a> have the knowledge and the expertise to bring back the information to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14221.223s">And</a> if on the state level, that's what they're doing, I question if any of this is local level. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14228.066s">When</a> you look at the agenda and you look at everything that has been put forth, and we're only on April 2. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14235.703s">It's</a> a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14237.185s">And</a> I get that you're proud of this big governing agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14240.169s">I</a> have read pages 12 through 15, because all your housing issues are there, but it's too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14247.538s">People</a> do not like change. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14250.241s">People</a> want to be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14252.264s">You've</a> got this big, long agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14254.787s">I</a> think maybe you might find some more balance by picking what's most important and what's beneficial and what can actually be accomplished within the next 12 months and lowering the agenda before telling people that they can't come to the podium and speak anymore, that their voice isn't valued, that if they don't get here, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14275.934s">It's</a> seven o'clock and there's not already 200 people here to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14280.158s">They</a> may not get to be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14282.1s">The</a> email doesn't always work. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14283.842s">We</a> met the 80 year old lady that doesn't even have a computer. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14286.264s">She's</a> been here twice, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14288.386s">How</a> many other people are across the street that they were not heard at all during COVID? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14293.591s">They</a> don't do Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14296.194s">Does</a> it make them wrong? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14297.795s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14299.414s">They</a> want to be heard too. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14301.235s">So</a> I'm going to ask you, please don't put a 90 minute limit that if you're not here to be heard 90 minutes, you can't be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14308.237s">You</a> know, maybe the forums. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14309.738s">I</a> love the whole idea of the forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14311.398s">I</a> really do because then maybe, you know, Javier, the guy who was the, he's on the board of directors for the affordable housing council.

 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17326.528s">No,</a> no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17326.988s">Before</a> that, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17329.171s">Zach,</a> unfortunately, I've been in here an awful lot lately, but it's not going to lower the cost of housing as you're sitting here talking about adding a transfer fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17341.633s">There</a> are realtors that are in Washington DC for the last two years petitioning Congress. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17347.357s">Could</a> you give us a moratorium on capital gains for either three months or six months, because this is a 31 year realtor in this community and there's a quite a few other ones that can come up here and talk about their own lived experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17361.546s">Our</a> entire first-time homebuyer market in 2017 and 2018, it got bought up by investors. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17368.553s">We're</a> talking about those single-family homes, a lot of them in North Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17372.496s">Alicia</a> talked to you about how she was excited to buy her starter home. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17376.319s">Those</a> starter homes are now the forever homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17378.561s">However,</a> we do have a lot of those that are owned by investors, adding a transfer tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17384.967s">is</a> not going to help them let go of those properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17388.469s">It's</a> another reason for them not to. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17390.651s">Kind</a> of like people aren't letting go of their real estate because they don't want to let go of their 2% rate or their 3% rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17397.295s">There</a> are people that are in Washington, D.C. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17399.477s">now</a> that are trying to do something with the mortgages. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17402.639s">There's</a> too many clogs in the funnel of housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17406.341s">There's</a> clogs with the rentals. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17407.842s">There's</a> clogs with the purchases. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17409.263s">Somebody</a> here said, you know, all the people buying homes in Medford now are millionaires. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17415.267s">I</a> guarantee you they're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17417.048s">We</a> are seeing two and three generations of a family go buy a house together, because that's the only way that they can afford to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17425.773s">I</a> don't care if that tax is $500 in the buyer and $500 in the seller. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17430.815s">It's</a> another fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17432.176s">All</a> of you have moved at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17434.117s">You've</a> moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17434.537s">You</a> moved to college, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17436.118s">You've</a> moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17437.119s">You've</a> all moved.

 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17633.294s">You've</a> made it really clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17634.674s">The</a> seven of you are the only people they're going to get to vote on that home rule petition that you're going to send to the state house on behalf of 58,000 people.
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17647.439s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17648.259s">And</a> you believe that you have that right to do that because you were elected regardless of who people vote for. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17655.221s">Once</a> you sit in that chair, you serve. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17658.463s">58,000</a> people in this community like unfortunately in the last four years, we haven't seen citizens brought into these chambers to discuss these things, the way the former mayors used to do that that doesn't happen anymore, but maybe in your capacity, you guys can make these things happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17679.5s">There</a> are better ways, not just the best thing that you're being told from way down the street to go sell to the people of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17687.885s">It</a> doesn't mean it's the best thing for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17690.406s">Look</a> at Cambridge, look at Homebridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17693.047s">They've</a> had an affordable housing trust fund since 1989. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17697.71s">They've</a> done amazing things. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17699.031s">I've</a> sold properties over there that they've matched the money and made people homeowners, but they've been working on it a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17705.254s">I'm</a> just asking you to take a step back and reassess the situation.

 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2208.617s">I</a> can't? <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2208.877s">Okay,</a> can I just speak regular?
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2210.779s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2211.82s">I'm</a> red, I'll face it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2214.243s">Everyone's</a> here because of the sales tax thing, but I get that you want some money for affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2219.788s">So</a> I went back through from the CPA site. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2223.551s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2223.872s">They</a> did a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2225.373s">And</a> in the last seven years, they have estimatedly collected $7 million from the taxpayers in Medford, which was an extra one and a half percent that was added onto their property tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2236.583s">They</a> have spent $1,187,000 on housing, which is about 25%. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2244.525s">I</a> keep hearing Medford needs affordable housing, and there could have been a larger portion of that, but I'm not surprised to hear that the majority of the applications that they got were for the parks and for the recreation stuff like that Medford is most 40% conservation land. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2261.617s">which</a> we have Alicia to thank for protecting that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2264.898s">And</a> that's what the people of Medford love. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2266.879s">They</a> love their history. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2268.099s">We</a> are the fourth oldest English settlement in the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2271.581s">So</a> yes, they want to protect their history. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2274.041s">We're</a> not seeing applications for affordable housing, but the point of information that I want to make is that the application that came in for $69,500, it says in their request that it was for attorney fees <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2290.367s">to</a> defend tenants that were being evicted. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2294.269s">So</a> if you are, if you don't have the money for your rent, you're considered indigent. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2299.532s">If</a> you go to district court, you can fill out the application and they will need an attorney of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2305.636s">The</a> courthouse, and I did check this with housing attorneys today, <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2309.298s">still</a> has a two tier system where it's mediation before it goes into court. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2315.021s">So</a> nobody's being thrown there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2317.023s">If</a> you think that we need $69,500 to create housing, that would be wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2323.146s">But</a> I don't think that we need to be paying attorneys with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2326.568s">And</a> you do have the affordable housing trust right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2329.81s">And</a> cities do have the right to earmark a certain percentage of CPA funds actually above your one third if it's going to affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2339.574s">And</a> this committee, your body has the right to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2344.015s">And</a> if we're not seeing that it's needed now, I question if there's any need to charge the taxpayers another 2% when they sell their house as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2352.799s">So</a> I'd ask you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2362.096s">You</a> guys have a lot in your plate, I get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2364.317s">You</a> have full time jobs, but before you approve this round of CPA funding, I would ask that you go back and you actually read the request from these people because $69,500, it's a lot of money to a first time buyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2379.821s">It's</a> a lot of money to somebody that doesn't have the money to pay their mortgage because their rent's not being paid by their tenant. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2385.762s">The</a> homeowners in the community matter just as much. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2387.943s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_3l8qmINEpLQ/2024-06-01_3l8qmINEpLQ.html">City Council Planning and Permitting Committee 02-14-24</a></h2>

href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1967.151s">Their</a> rent was well below what anybody else was paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1971.733s">So</a> there is a big attrition there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1973.754s">There</a> is no way that those people were going to be made whole, whether they stayed there or they went somewhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1980.118s">Their</a> rent was brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1982.099s">Medford</a> is a victim of its own success. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1985.381s">It's</a> not a bad thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1986.542s">Everyone</a> said, bring in the green line. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1988.363s">We</a> want the amenity of the green line. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1990.484s">We</a> call that the money line, because where does it go? <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1993.446s">It</a> goes to Kendall Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1994.986s">It</a> goes down to the medical buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1997.248s">People</a> that work in those high paying jobs, that's where they travel to, is on that train. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2002.751s">They're</a> coming to Medford, and I'll tell you, I represent 732 landlords in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2009.074s">So</a> if you need me to come back with a petition, I will. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2011.655s">They</a> would like to be heard on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2013.516s">They</a> don't want just the tenant end of it being heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2016.658s">There</a> really is not a problem with a lot of the landlords and a lot of the tenants in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2022.085s">They</a> communicate very well because the majority of the landlords in Medford are small property owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2027.873s">They</a> own one or two units. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2030.757s">I</a> have an email here, which I am going to read into the record, and it's from one of my clients who emailed everyone on this council today. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2038.922s">Dear</a> housing members, as a homeowner of a three-family house in Medford for almost 60 years, I have never written to the mayor or city council before. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2048.168s">But</a> when a friend told me today that there was a meeting at city hall tonight at 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2053.431s">where</a> the Medford City Council's Housing Self Committee will propose creating zoning that will control rent <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2059.875s">And</a> also, and landlord rights to evict a tenant for any reason, I was appalled and had to write to all those concerned in this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2067.881s">Firstly,</a> regarding rent control around 1970 Boston, Cambridge, Sumbul instituted rent control, Medford did not. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2076.087s">It</a> ended in the late 70s there about with Boston abolishing it around 1994. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2081.651s">Voters</a> voted it out for the simple reason that the homes in those cities were deteriorating at a rapid pace. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2087.716s">The</a> landlords, mostly small, did not garner enough revenue to fix important breakdowns. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2092.84s">So</a> the apartments eventually were like trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2095.362s">The</a> carpenters, electricians, plumbers wages were going up during that time, but not the rents. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2100.726s">So</a> it was difficult to fix deteriorating structures without the proper income. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2105.269s">Please</a> don't let that happen in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2107.571s">As</a> far as ending landlord's rights to evict a tenant for any reason, whoa, that's not a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2114.236s">In</a> our almost 60 years of marriage and many tenants, last year found us with a tenant who always missed paying his monthly rent with unbelievable excuses. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2124.423s">We</a> had to call him three to four times the week before the first of each month to remind him that the rent was almost due. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2131.328s">Even</a> then the rent was not received until two to three weeks later. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2135.01s">Also,</a> we told him that another tenant had an allergy to cats for so pets were not allowed within three months he's serendipitously brought in a cat. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2144.437s">My</a> other tenant was about to give us notice for that reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2147.419s">So</a> I told the cat tenant that since we're not on the same page, and he has about two to three months to find another apartment. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2154.224s">He</a> left quietly on the first of the month. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2157.427s">Imagine</a> if I did not have the right to evict him for any reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2161.471s">Also,</a> that was the first time in all those years that I've had to evict someone. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2165.955s">I</a> have more to say, but I want to get this email over to you all before the 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2170.139s">meeting</a> tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2171.34s">I</a> wish we all knew sooner about this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2174.423s">So</a> I am going to ask you, maybe you could publish the entire community, a lot of communities, they send their notices out with their water bills, you're mailing it anyways, you're mailing a tax bill, send a notice to the whole city that you would like to discuss the landlord and the tenant issue here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2191.97s">The</a> problem is if you cannot come up with a solution that is going to help the rising interest rates, what?

schools and our community, and to advise the Medford School District on emergency planning, providing professional development opportunities and implementing best practices in emergencies of any kind, while delivering transparency and communication with families and guardians of students with special needs and all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=4998.814s">The</a> Universal Safety Committee meets monthly, realizing and putting into practice ways for school staff to provide necessary accommodations organically to continue to create adaptive change in culture, demonstrating that all students are Medford students. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5015.551s">Some</a> of our accomplishments for the past two school years are the first one we did was our classroom go bags. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5022.287s">These</a> were created for all of our subseparate classrooms and they include items that individual students may need in case of an emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5031.632s">There</a> may be a fidget toy, a stress ball, noise reducing headphones, a notepad to draw pictures while they're out on a fire drill, or if there's an evacuation. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5043.279s">We</a> also had our second <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5045.27s">I</a> believe it's our second annual safety preparedness presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5049.652s">And</a> with that, we received 96 emergency go bags that we were able to distribute to the community and members of our school department and also our special education students. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5061.697s">We</a> also developed our USC resource webpage, which will be accessible to all our families and community members. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5069.48s">It</a> has different <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5072.345s">resources</a> that members can use and look at when items come up or questions come up about different situations that happen within the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5082.109s">And</a> then our last accomplishment is our individual emergency response plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5087.211s">And</a> these are for our students with disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5090.312s">There's</a> a discussion at their specific team meeting and we talk about what sort of specific needs that they may have. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5097.115s">And</a> we create a document that goes along with their individual education program. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5103.898s">And</a> what we have next is a few pictures of the assembly of our classroom emergency go bags. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5109.601s">Our</a> project transition students took this on as a project. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5114.583s">We</a> had many donations and we also had funding from CPAC and other sources. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5120.547s">It</a> includes hand sanitizers, like I said, fidget toys, things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5125.169s">And</a> the students in our project transition classroom put these together and distributed them <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5131.788s">across</a> the district to our different classrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5136.391s">This</a> is us organizing and distributing the home emergency go bags that we received through our emergency preparedness from Homeland Security. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5146.998s">So,</a> Tanya, Jan Hollaback, Susanna Campbell and I, we organized them according to drop-off, pickup, and we all were able to get those bags to community members who had requested them. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5161.152s">And</a> this is just another picture of the distribution. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5164.233s">This</a> is the many bags that we had in our speech and language center. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5174.934s">And</a> our goals for school year 2021 to 2022 for advocacy and awareness campaign to increase awareness and the use of smart 911, which is a program that Medford has in place already. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5189.637s">If</a> you have, <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5191.134s">someone</a> in your home that has a disability or has an illness, you can note this with the SMART 911 program. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5200.477s">And</a> if there's an emergency and the fire department or the police department show up at your home, they will know that they are going to find a person or may find a person there that has the disability that's listed in the SMART 911 program. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5216.762s">We're</a> also for advocacy and awareness, the file of life when <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5221.604s">fire</a> personnel or police officers show up at a home, they typically will look on a refrigerator for what's called a file of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5229.989s">It's</a> a magnet that lists allergies, illnesses, disabilities, and things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5237.855s">And</a> they are trained to look there first. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5239.836s">So</a> it's something we really want to get out into the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5244.119s">For</a> training and resources, we would like to host our third annual emergency preparedness event. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5250.221s">Emergency</a> Preparedness Event 3.0. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5253.382s">It</a> should be amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5254.982s">And</a> hopefully it will be in person this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5256.822s">This</a> year we did it virtually and we had a great turnout and we think it will be even better next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5264.924s">To</a> create and distribute pamphlet on available resources, including self-advocacy, civil rights, and ADA. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5273.165s">And</a> then monitoring of the projects that we currently have in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5277.038s">So</a> ensuring the continuation of these projects by refilling the classroom go bags, and ensuring the implementation of the IERs. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5289.042s">And</a> are there any questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5290.282s">That's</a> our presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5292.763s">Great</a> job, ladies. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5293.723s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5295.544s">Member</a> McLaughlin? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5297.264s">Do</a> you want to go first? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5299.425s">I</a> just wanted to say thank you, guys, for presenting. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5302.106s">It's</a> been such a pleasure working with you all the past two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5306.632s">Our</a> emergency preparedness events have been really remarkable and I want to make sure that the community knows that, you know, the work we're doing certainly originated with persons with disabilities as we thought about well how did they get out of the building in a fire or what happens in a school shooting or any of these instances and we sort of really had to start to think through those things but <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5325.133s">I</a> also want to assure the community that this is for every individual. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5329.494s">And</a> that's what you learn in the emergency preparedness meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5331.775s">Suddenly</a> you start to realize that we haven't thought through these things as families and as individuals, like where do we go in a crisis? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5338.277s">What</a> do we do if there's suddenly a national emergency and we have to evacuate? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5342.038s">Where</a> are we going? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5342.778s">And</a> this is sort of what the emergency preparedness program has taught. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5346.299s">And</a> so the Mass Office on Disability has partnered with us on this program and they have been really tremendous. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5353.158s">you</a> all and the IERs as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5354.798s">I</a> just wanted to say the individual emergency response has been a model for DESE. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5359.759s">So</a> it's sort of, it was a takeoff on the IEP, but individual emergency response also obviously are for people with and without disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5367.1s">Some</a> people might break a foot, need additional assistance, what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5370.961s">So</a> these can be made available to all individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5373.702s">So</a> this has been a really remarkable program in our districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5376.282s">And</a> I wanna ensure open invitations to the community <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5381.88s">invitations</a> to our school committee members or community members. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5385.283s">The</a> meetings occur the last Friday of the month at 8am prompt. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5392.108s">In</a> the future, we'll be in the superintendent's conference room. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5398.373s">So</a> the equity and safety, I want to thank you all for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5401.535s">You</a> have really brought that to our district as well and the importance of that and really took <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5405.417s">you</a> know, a concerning situation and made the best of it and continue to make the best of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5409.198s">And</a> those emergency go bags for people who don't know what's in there, there's everything from chargeable flashlights to crank radios to, you know, just an amazing toolkit. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5417.76s">So</a> thank you guys so much.
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5452.001s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5452.241s">It's</a> our pleasure. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5453.042s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5454.443s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5457.405s">On</a> number six, we have CPAC report presented by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5460.707s">Alex</a> Lark and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5462.048s">Tanya</a> Sullivan, co-chairs of the special education <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5465.472s">Parent</a> Advisory Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5466.712s">I</a> feel like it's been years. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5475.854s">So</a> we are here to present for the Medford Special Education Parent Advisory Council, Madam Mayor, Superintendent, and school committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5485.377s">The</a> board members are Alex Lorak and myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5489.838s">We</a> are the co-chairs of BCPAC. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5492.468s">Our</a> treasurer is Jamil Webb Davis, and our secretary is Anne Herzog Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5498.052s">Membership</a> includes students, families, and guardians of children on IEPs, 504s, and any other interested parties. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5506.579s">The</a> Medford CPAC is always looking for parents or guardians of children with special needs and other interested parties, including students, to be a part of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5515.705s">If</a> you would like to learn more about how to get involved with the Medford CPAC, <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5519.563s">please</a> email medford.cpac at gmail.com. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5525.546s">We</a> would love to have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5528.548s">Our</a> mission. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5529.068s">So</a> what is CPAC? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5530.069s">Some</a> people watching may not know what CPAC is. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5533.431s">Our</a> purpose is to fulfill the directive stated in Chapter 71B of the Massachusetts General Laws, which requires a school district to establish a PAC, Parent Advisory Council, and assigns both an advisory and a participatory function to the PAC. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5547.95s">In</a> meeting this requirement, the mission of the Medford Special Education Parent Advisory Council is to advise the district on matters that pertain to the education and safety of students with disabilities by seeking input from the special education parent members. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5564.117s">We</a> meet regularly with school officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5567.298s">We</a> participate in the planning, development, and evaluation of the school district's special education program. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5573.374s">and</a> we participate in planning workshops and activities as prioritized by the CPAC board. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5580.218s">We</a> have some highlights to let you know about. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5582.719s">There's</a> a couple pages of them, so sorry if we're going on and on, but we were very busy this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5588.263s">This</a> has been a crazy year for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5592.125s">The</a> CPAC co-chairs, Alex and myself, were involved in the Medford reopening strategy. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5596.808s">I</a> was part of the district-wide reopening task force, and Alex was part of the McGlynn reopening team. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5603.522s">CPAC</a> hosted four Q&A sessions with Joan Bowen to address questions, concerns, and challenges our families experienced regarding school reopening. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5612.086s">The</a> feedback on that, I will say, was tremendous. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5615.548s">Parents</a> so appreciated that, and they so appreciated Joan taking the time to actually participate in the Q&As and offer explanations and valuable information. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5628.914s">The</a> four sessions were held during August, September, and October of 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5634.307s">CPAC</a> participated in the tiered focused monitoring process and received a commendable rating, recognizing the collaboration among district leadership, the CPAC and the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5644.669s">There's</a> still much work to do moving forward and we look forward to our next steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5650.25s">CPAC</a> has continued advocacy for the adoption of a disability awareness curriculum in Medford public schools and is presented to the curriculum subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5658.991s">We</a> continue to collaborate with the special education department <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5662.729s">and</a> with the curriculum subcommittee to advance issues important for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5667.413s">Both</a> Alex and I were panelists for the disability awareness professional development program offered to teachers and administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5674.92s">And</a> Alex was part of Medford team and the Desi sponsored family school partnership initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5681.185s">CPAC</a> offered several content rich presentations throughout the school year, new for the school year of 2020 and 2021, <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5689.629s">CPAC</a> presentations qualified as PDP credits for teachers and staff who attended the presentations. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5697.015s">And</a> the topics included basic rights to evaluation and eligibility, transition planning and services for students 14 and over, understanding dyslexia with a focus on Orton-Gillingham reading instruction, out-of-district community connections, differentiated curriculum accommodations and modifications, <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5717.773s">and</a> vocational presentation on opportunities for students on IEPs. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5724.718s">CPAC</a> goals, we're focused on moving the disability awareness curriculum forward for students in all schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5730.903s">Through</a> this disability awareness curriculum, students will develop understanding and respect for fellow students with physical, intellectual, sensory, and developmental disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5742.151s">The</a> curriculum will provide age appropriate information that highlights the unique perspectives <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5747.638s">and</a> strength people of all abilities bring to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5751.14s">This</a> will begin with a pilot program being implemented in the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5755.163s">We</a> will also continue to serve on the special education and behavioral health subcommittee where for the special education part of this committee, forming authentic peer friendships in school and in community and for the behavioral health side of it, the trauma informed schools to really have our schools be on point <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5775.998s">when</a> it comes to being trauma informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5777.539s">So</a> we have a lot of great people in the district that are helping us work on that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5785.205s">And</a> we actually have a few awards we wanted to give out every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5789.228s">CPAC</a> presents an award or awards to members in the district who for the current school year have embodied what it means to go above and beyond for our students and families. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5799.456s">So</a> as we read the names, we request that each person come up and then <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5804.893s">remain</a> up here until they're all done so we can get a photo up. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5810.716s">Mel,</a> do you mind taking the picture? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5811.836s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5813.457s">Okay,</a> our first person, I'll read what I have here. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5818.779s">So</a> our first award is going to go to Carla Andre. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5821.32s">Carla</a> is a fifth-year teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5823.861s">Yes,</a> absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5828.774s">Carla</a> is a fifth year teacher in the access program at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5832.676s">The</a> access program, for those that don't know, is a life skills based program. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5836.458s">It's</a> focused on functional academics, independent living skills, and community interactions. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5842.242s">Carla</a> has always been a think outside the box educator, and this past year was no exception. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5848.145s">Carla</a> took the pandemic as a personal challenge and raised the bar on new ways of teaching her students and providing virtual community experiences. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5856.83s">She</a> was integral in transitioning students to virtual and back to in-person, making it look seamless. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5862.793s">Thank</a> you, Carla. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5869.376s">Our</a> second award goes to Denise Desjardins. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5872.978s">She</a> is the district-wide physical therapist. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5882.143s">She</a> is not happy that she has to come up here, but that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5885.832s">Denise</a> provides PT services, physical therapy services in three of our elementary schools, both middle schools and Medford Vocational. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5893.555s">If</a> a student requires PT services through their IEP, chances are Denise has worked with them, advocated and provided support for them and their families. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5902.638s">During</a> the pandemic, Denise worked tirelessly with families and students to transition from school to remote learning, from elementary to middle school and from remote learning back to in-person <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5913.448s">and</a> I'm sure I have forgotten something because she does so much in this district. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5918.39s">Thank</a> you, Denise. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5924.613s">Our</a> third and final award we'd like to give to Joan Bowen. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5935.038s">Having</a> worked in the district for many years, Joan became the Director of Special Education and Pupil Services in 2019, right before all this craziness happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5943.513s">Just</a> in time for the COVID pandemic, we are offering this award for outstanding collaboration with CPAC, transparency of the special education process during the pandemic, and her advocacy for the speedy in-person return to school for children with high needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5959.184s">We</a> are also offering this award to Mrs. Bowen on behalf of all special education teachers and service providers in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5965.566s">who</a> were the first to return to school in person, while also making remote learning work for students with special needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5971.432s">They</a> were truly frontline workers during this pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5974.875s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5980.52s">Mayor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5980.761s">Do</a> you want to take a picture?
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5982.482s">Can</a> we get a picture with the school committee, actually? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5984.484s">Can</a> you guys come right in here? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5987.307s">And</a> then may I, Mayor, just for a moment? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5989.088s">Yes,</a> Member Rubio. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5989.869s">Also,</a> I just wanted to say thank you to our co-chairs for our CPAC and your tireless efforts in advocating for students with and without disabilities and the folks that are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5998.235s">I</a> also want to say Denise Desjardins was distributing lunch to students all summer long. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6004.239s">And</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6004.739s">Andre</a> was doing a presentation on differentiated curriculum to make sure that we're presuming competence for every student in our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6010.683s">So</a> they're just really wonderful examples of folks here. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6014.266s">So</a> a community shot would be great with us.
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6129.253s">Some</a> great things, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6132.355s">Number</a> seven, recommendation to approve Medford Public Schools strategic plan updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6136.577s">Dr.</a> Marice Edouard-Vincent, Dr. Peter Cushing, and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6139.779s">Suzanne</a> Galusi.
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6550.805s">Thank</a> you very much, Dr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6552.686s">Thank</a> you, Madam Mayor and members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6555.026s">I'm</a> just going to talk the next piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6556.847s">We</a> wanted to make sure that this document is accessible to the entire community so that you will know that there is a glossary of terms that will be included in the strategic plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6567.301s">Just</a> a brief example, there's several terms in this document, but just a brief example are located here so that parents can, or community members can look and see what we're referencing in certain items of this plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6581.591s">You'll</a> see that this brief example just gives an explanation for what a 504 plan is, what a BCBA is, it's an employee within the city, it will explain, <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6594.197s">Credit</a> for Life, which is an organization that works each year with high school students. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6598.639s">So</a> we just want to make sure that this plan, when members of the community are reading it, is accessible to all. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6604.4s">So</a> you'll also find a glossary of terms. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6607.882s">Moving</a> forward with the rest, I'm going to start off with the achievement bucket. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6611.603s">I</a> just want to say Dr. Cushing and Dr. Wadvinson gave a very nice overview of the strategic plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6618.545s">What</a> you're going to notice here is <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6621.23s">just</a> a high level, a more detailed, as Dr. Cushing mentioned, it was provided to the school committee and will eventually be posted on the website for those to see the more, the sub documents that Dr. Cushing was referring to. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6633.04s">So</a> in the achievement objective, there are going to be four initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6639.185s">You'll</a> notice that as I speak about them, these initiatives start at like a foundational level and move forward that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6646.951s">So</a> for example, the first initiative is going to talk about curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6651.045s">and</a> then move into an effective instruction, and then common assessments to make sure that we can monitor the curriculum that we're utilizing and ensuring that the instruction matches that, and how we can use technology efficiently to wrap that all together in a nice little package. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6668.919s">So</a> this first one, as I mentioned, is establish an ongoing curriculum review cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6674.743s">So</a> the anticipated outcomes for this would be an alignment of curriculum with the Massachusetts frameworks, <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6680.687s">assessing</a> curriculum for bias, which we do annually through the use of a rubric tool and professional development to support curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6689.691s">Now</a> we are in the process of a lot of alignment right now with our curriculum here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6696.673s">As</a> standards are being updated through the department of education, we have to align our curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6702.716s">And</a> as such, we're in the process of that through the humanities department, as well as the math department. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6709.726s">The</a> second initiative is the use of evidence-based instructional practices to implement the curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6717.063s">So</a> the anticipated outcomes for that are educators utilize teaching practices proven to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6722.884s">Students</a> are both challenged and supported. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6726.185s">Students</a> engage in academic conversations and metacognitive activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6730.945s">All</a> students have access to instruction that benefit their learning style and progression. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6735.886s">Instructional</a> feedback is rich, authentic, and targeted. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6740.027s">And</a> so these outcomes are aligned with the five core actions that Dr. Vincent has brought with her <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6746.578s">here</a> to the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6749.04s">We</a> work with this, with building leaders, as well as department heads and teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6755.944s">That</a> focus is continuing next year, as well as training and integration. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6763.008s">The</a> third initiative is to implement common assessments to inform instruction and make modifications to our current curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6771.832s">Anticipated</a> outcomes are utilization of student data to inform instruction, data to better identify students in need of additional support interventions and enrichment, growth determination per student, and streamline and update district-wide assessment schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6790.902s">So</a> this outcome, I think, speaks crucially to the work that we have ahead of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6797.045s">A</a> lot of this is in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6799.366s">but</a> we need to refine, align, and enhance what we currently have in place due to what COVID has done to disrupt student learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6808.988s">So</a> a big focus next year will be on developing reporting systems and progress monitoring through the enhancement of our school-based data teams. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6821.831s">So</a> we'll have a lot of work on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6823.351s">Another</a> piece to this is finalizing our early literacy screener. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6827.932s">which</a> we've been piloting for the past two years, as well as coming up with common assessments district-wide with a norm-based assessment tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6839.001s">That</a> way we have district-wide data with common goals and terminology to help us with our progress monitoring of students, ensuring they get what they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6851.37s">And</a> the final initiative is provide instructional technology that meets the curricular needs of educators and learners <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6857.764s">Those</a> anticipated outcomes are to create a district technology plan, which I think is the biggest outcome and piece of this, which means we are going to assess our infrastructure, personnel, digital resources, and staff development needs, and then work really hard to create a plan and implement that plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6878.228s">engage</a> stakeholders to support the effective use of instructional technology and digital learning resources, assessment of current technology management and infrastructure staff and recommendations for future growth, critical elements necessary for effectively utilizing technology for teaching and learning identified and implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6898.238s">I'm</a> now going to pass off to Dr. Cushing to speak to you about the collaborative
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7207.498s">Good</a> evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7210.32s">Equity</a> represents equitable learning opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7213.982s">Specifically,</a> the district's objective is to understand the needs of our diverse population and support the academic, social, emotional, and physical needs of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7225.53s">As</a> you will see through the five initiatives under this objective, as a district, we believe in supporting the whole student. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7233.435s">Our</a> first initiative is increase the support and understanding <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7237.154s">of</a> the health, wellness, and social-emotional needs of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7245.398s">The</a> anticipated outcomes are that we will have a social-emotional inventory to share with the public, social-emotional resources that are available to all faculty, social-emotional learning plan, excuse me, learning action plan, professional development plan, increased ability <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7266.375s">for</a> students to access the curriculum, increased students' social-emotional skills, data cycles and screenings will be established, and we will have increased evidence-based groups for counseling. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7280.625s">An</a> example of one action item from this initiative is an annual assessment of the district's current, thank you, of the district's current social-emotional learning programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7291.292s">Each</a> year, the district will identify areas of strength and need. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7295.907s">This</a> information will be used to develop social-emotional learning action plans at school and district levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7302.512s">A</a> monthly review of the action plans will take place to ensure that we are moving forward productively. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7309.978s">Our</a> second initiative is to prioritize development of systems that support a shared vision for disability awareness, anti-racism, anti-bias, and cultural proficiency across the school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7323.427s">There</a> are five anticipated outcomes of this initiative, which include emergence of an increasingly diverse staff, culturally proficient curriculum for all students, assessment of the state of our district with regard to diversity, district-wide disability awareness curriculum, and social justice curriculum for secondary education. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7346.278s">When</a> we think about and speak about diversity, our district vision encompasses numerous stakeholders. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7353.179s">We</a> are working toward building a community that sees diversity as a strength, while also recognizing that bias is real. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7360.941s">We</a> are considering many groups of people who are at risk of being marginalized. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7366.002s">This</a> includes people of color, people with disabilities, students of various religious, cultural, linguistic backgrounds, and more. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7374.983s">I</a> would like to also point out that for many individuals, they are a member of more than one of these groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7381.328s">I</a> would like to highlight two action items from this initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7384.91s">First,</a> our racial equity task force. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7387.872s">This</a> group of community members, parents, caregivers, teachers, and administrators is focused on implementing a means by which to diversify staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7398.28s">In</a> addition, the racial equity task force is focused on assessing the district's cultural proficiency through an equity audit. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7406.925s">That</a> is being done this fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7408.746s">The</a> results of this audit will provide us with information that will help us incorporate information into this living document, our strategic plan, so that we can move forward productively. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7419.931s">Also,</a> I would like to briefly touch upon expanding our disability awareness curriculum, something that was also mentioned by our CPAC here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7427.346s">This</a> will include further professional development so that we can reach more staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7433.71s">In</a> addition, we are piloting disability awareness at the kindergarten, first grade, and high school levels this coming school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7443.055s">Initiative</a> three. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7444.636s">Initiative</a> three states provide equal access to academic support and enrichment. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7451.32s">The</a> anticipated outcomes are to define and adopt MTSSE. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7456.472s">For</a> reference, MTSS stands for multi-tiered systems of support. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7462.555s">It's</a> a well-known framework for how school districts can build necessary systems to ensure that each student receives a high quality educational experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7471.94s">Under</a> Dr. Edouard-Vincent's guidance, our task force added an E to MTSS. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7477.983s">The</a> E represents enrichment. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7480.984s">We</a> understand that enrichment is a vital component in meeting all of our students' needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7486.763s">There</a> are four anticipated outcomes of this initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7489.505s">Oh,</a> excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7490.285s">Hang</a> on. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7490.526s">Let</a> me go back and tell you the anticipated outcomes. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7493.207s">We</a> will establish common practices, procedures, and terminology for screening, assessment, data collection, analysis, and focused evidence-based intervention. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7503.094s">We</a> will expand a library of special education assessments, and we will have extended day opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7509.498s">One</a> action item within this initiative relates to the Massachusetts Dyslexia Guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7514.556s">To</a> analyze this guidance, we are forming a team to review the guidelines, review Medford's current level of compliance with recommendations made in the Massachusetts Dyslexia Guidelines, and develop, begin implementation of an action plan that will target items from this guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7531.749s">Initiative</a> four, ensure positive school culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7537.02s">has</a> three anticipated outcomes, demonstrated improvement of school culture based on data collection, responsive classroom implementation at elementary level district wide, and restorative justice implementation at the secondary level district wide. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7552.83s">Numerous</a> stakeholders also weighed in on this objective and the initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7560.657s">We</a> considered various developmental levels, thinking about preschool all the way through high school and how to create the most positive school culture all the way through. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7570.585s">One</a> of our specific initiatives speaks to promoting positive school culture by developing a culture climate action plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7577.415s">When</a> we think about a positive school culture, we're also thinking about building a community that sees diversity as a strength, as we mentioned previously. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7585.538s">These</a> practices work in tandem and we remain inclusive in our thinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7590.039s">For</a> example, enrichment opportunities are an excellent occasion for students to learn about cultural experiences, seeking out a diverse group of professionals to present to middle school and high school students about career paths, <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7604.047s">helps</a> to break down stereotypes and gives all students a model. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7608.189s">For</a> clarity, when we say diverse, this encompasses all types of diversity. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7613.373s">We're</a> talking about racial, cultural, linguistic, disability, LGBTQIA+, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7620.777s">Seeing</a> students who look like you or sound like you or have had similar life experiences achieve great things has a powerful influence on our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7630.222s">Initiative</a> five, <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7631.618s">The</a> final initiative under equitable learning environments is to recruit retain and develop a diverse staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7639.126s">The</a> anticipated outcomes of this initiative are to cultivate a diverse workforce and increase retention rates for all new employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7648.654s">One</a> of the specific actions included in this work is to expand our human resources recruiting activities to fill all positions and develop more diversity through using memberships in the New England Minority Network and the Massachusetts Partnership for Diversity to facilitate this goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7666.922s">To</a> highlight and understand why this is so important, we need to consider our current teaching workforce. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7672.924s">Based</a> on information from our human resources office and DESE data, <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7678.008s">1%</a> of our teachers are Hispanic, while 13.5% of our students are Hispanic. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7681.831s">0.41%</a> of our teachers are Black, compared with 11.9% of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7685.754s">And</a> 1.9% of our students are Asian, while 9.5% of our students are Asian. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7701.328s">The</a> district is committed to increasing diversity of our workforce so that it better represents our student body. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7708.833s">In</a> closing, as you have heard, equity is a large umbrella under which many key initiatives reside. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7714.617s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=7714.937s">I'll</a> turn it over to Dr. Edward-Linson.

 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8370.023s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8371.843s">Thank</a> you for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8374.504s">And</a> for the plan, it's really great to see it broken down into both the acronym and the initiatives and their relative, you know, prefix and the initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8381.986s">And</a> I especially appreciate the glossary. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8384.526s">And</a> I too would just encourage folks to consider <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8388.708s">the</a> definitions and to consult with our experts in the community on the definition. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8393.111s">So,</a> for example, the definition of a 504, I would ask that respectfully that we talk with, you know, Dr. Hollenbeck or Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8402.198s">Bowen</a> around strength based language is really sort of, you know, what we want to, what I would recommend using. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8410.744s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8414.409s">to</a> member, through the chair, to member Ruseau's point around equity, I always think of sort of equity versus equality, and this is not from me, this is a quote from someone else who I'm sorry, I can't credit right now, because I'm not sure who, but it's, you know, equity is not that everyone gets the same, it's that everyone gets what they need, as opposed to equal, in which everyone gets the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8437.464s">So</a> I just really like that sort of a definition, but I also appreciate having the definitions <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8442.512s">be</a> universal and be across districts so that we're all under the same understanding when we hear these different words or acronyms or what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8450.776s">So</a> with that, I actually also wanted to put a motion on the floor, but I don't know that I can do that if there's one on four hours, so I'll wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8458.099s">Motion</a> to approve, but I will wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8460.16s">Thank</a> you, Dr. Edward-Vincent and everyone on the tactical team and within the district for all your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8465.502s">Appreciate</a> it.
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8552.395s">.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8552.455s">So</a> thank you for all the work that everybody put into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8555.257s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8557.217s">Thank</a> you, member van de gloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8558.138s">Member</a> graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8561.399s">Just</a> one final note that this is substantially different than what we saw in February before the pandemic sort of upended everything.
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8595.758s">So</a> this is like a year's worth of work on its own. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8599.34s">And</a> instead you all did it, you know, with just a few other things going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8606.382s">So</a> I'm really appreciative and I can't underscore how much work this was, so thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8611.69s">I</a> second that. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8614.592s">Me</a> a third then. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8617.075s">Great</a> work. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8618.436s">Number</a> eight, report on the business services. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8622.519s">Oh,</a> yes, that's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8623.86s">Motion</a> to add this to the annual presentation list by member Rousseau, seconded by member McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8629.705s">All</a> in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8630.726s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8631.106s">All</a> opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8632.327s">Motion</a> passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8633.208s">Can</a> I make a motion to approve the recommendation? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8638.657s">of</a> the NPS strategic plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8640.057s">Motion</a> to approve the recommendation by member Glossman, seconded by member Van der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8644.179s">All</a> in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8645.299s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8645.579s">All</a> opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8647.099s">Motion</a> passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8648.88s">Now</a> number eight, report on the business services audit of the Metropublic Schools by the Management Solution, TMS, Mr. Andrew Parkett and Mr. David Murphy. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8667.383s">Hold</a> on, Mr. Murphy, let me just get your microphone on, sorry.
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8813.071s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Murphy. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8814.912s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8818.714s">Good</a> evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8820.175s">We're</a> pleased to be here this evening on behalf of TMS to present this report to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8826.579s">I'm</a> Judy Hull. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8827.58s">I</a> am the Senior Vice President and Chief Education Officer for TMS, and I've been in this business for over 40 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8835.784s">It's</a> a hard number to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8838.176s">But</a> I have been a teacher of students from grades three through adults. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8842.519s">I've</a> been a curriculum director. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8844.02s">I've</a> been a business administrator and I've been a superintendent of schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8847.462s">So</a> I've been in most places that education happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8851.545s">So</a> it's nice to be on this side of it and to be able to be a resource to districts as they try to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8858.97s">Alan,</a> I'll let you take the next side of honors.
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8951.228s">So</a> the report is broken into two parts. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8954.569s">The</a> first part is the findings. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8955.949s">And</a> basically what we did was we combed through the data from the interviews. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8961.03s">One</a> of us asked the question while the other was the note taker so that we could each focus on our relative tasks around facilitation and note taking to make sure we captured everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8970.852s">And</a> then we looked for common themes that came across from either all or most of the interviews. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8976.073s">And</a> so that's what you have in the findings piece of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8978.857s">And</a> then the second piece of the report is a set of recommendations around budget development and financial management. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8985.9s">And</a> these recommendations really stem from state and national organizations as well as TMS's own best practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8993.683s">We</a> have worked in several districts across the Commonwealth and collaboratives as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8999.725s">And</a> so we have learned along the way about what our best practices and how we can make those real for our clients. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9009.05s">That's</a> where the recommendations stem from. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9011.392s">So</a> we're gonna start with the findings first. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9016.496s">And</a> let's talk a little bit about the budget development themes. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9021.981s">And</a> these were things that were common recurring themes in the interviews that we did with folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9027.045s">And</a> we interviewed about 20 staff members, both on the city side as well as school side and superintendent as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9033.771s">So</a> these are where the themes came along. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9037.688s">One</a> of the themes that came out in our discussions with folks was that the timeline for putting the budget together seemed to be too late for the kind of presentation, preparation, discussion, and revision that's necessary to put a comprehensive budget together. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9056.098s">And</a> I think when we get to the recommendations, you'll see why we came to the conclusions we did about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9063.853s">people</a> also felt that prior to the current administration, that there was a lack of input and advocacy for student needs across that. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9073.056s">They</a> have also reported to us that the current administration is beginning to change that work in the way the budget is developed so that there is input and there is the opportunity to have some advocacy for student needs in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9088.941s">So</a> I think that's an optimistic sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9092.912s">The</a> other part of the data told us that also because of some high turnover in administrative positions, that some of the history of requests along the way got lost in the shuffle. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9105.042s">So</a> again, just hopeful that the current administration, as things gel and come together and you have some longevity together, that you're gonna be able to really have some good budget history on which to build. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9117.612s">And</a> so people really in the interviews seem very optimistic <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9121.997s">about</a> what the future holds for the budget development process. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9127.74s">And</a> I'll let Alan speak to the financial management themes.
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9295.298s">Just</a> if you could clarify what encumbered means for the community, please.
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9361.334s">Yeah,</a> and it also gives an opportunity for people to see what's left. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9366.755s">What</a> you pay, what you need to pay, and then what the net is that's left allows you to really calculate and track the budget in a way that makes some sense and to be able to have a software package that can do that for you versus manual calculations <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9382.249s">is</a> certainly gonna be a much more efficient way to be able to do that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9386.673s">Mayor.</a> 
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9515.768s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9516.449s">And</a> some folks reported that the process for submitting purchase orders and tracking them was different from department to department. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9523.714s">Again,</a> I think it's because you don't have, at the current moment, an accounting system that can <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9529.698s">take</a> you through that process in a way that is efficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9533.22s">So</a> that was something else that came through in the data as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9537.322s">So</a> those were sort of the major themes that came out of the interviews that we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9541.584s">And</a> so we'll move on now to the recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9544.465s">And</a> we'll begin with budget development. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9547.747s">And</a> it's interesting to <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9550.186s">see</a> and hear that you have a new strategic plan because you stole our thunder a little bit, but that's okay.
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9559.648s">Yes,</a> nice job superintendent, great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9563.449s">So</a> we would recommend an expanded timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9567.65s">Both</a> of us in our positions as superintendent usually begin this process in November with our administrators. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9574.071s">We</a> begin that process of looking at where it is that you want to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9580.176s">And</a> aligning the document with your school improvement or your district strategic plan is critical. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9586.181s">They</a> should fit like a glove. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9588.202s">You</a> should not have one document over here and another document over here that don't speak to each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9593.666s">Because</a> the only way you're going to be able to accomplish the ambitious goals you've just set for yourselves tonight is to make sure that they are resourced properly so that the things that you have committed to can happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9605.696s">And</a> the only way to do that is to put those two things together. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9609.377s">So</a> it requires the budget process to begin much earlier in the cycle in to begin November ish, give or take. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9617.285s">I</a> used to with my principles tell them that their ticket to their December vacation was their budget requests in my hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9624.553s">You</a> know that was often a way to kind of motivate to get the thing done. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9629.692s">And</a> it's a collaborative process. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9631.193s">Now</a> that you've got the roadmap in front of you, you really can begin doing a collaborative process on the budget and how all of the pieces impact each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9642.08s">It</a> also allows for accountability in the budget cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9645.342s">It's</a> a term used in business world, it's called value chain analysis, but you measure the effectiveness of the resources with the metrics for success of goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9655.708s">So</a> we heard repeatedly tonight looking at <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9658.666s">improve</a> student outcomes, and how you measure those student outcomes gives you a window on how the resources are being used to accomplish the goals that you've set for yourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9670.556s">So</a> it, in a way, puts in its own accountability system within the budget process as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9677.181s">Are</a> the resources we are targeting towards these particular outcomes, are they making a difference? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9684.707s">And</a> if they're not, <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9686.638s">then</a> how do we need to resource things differently? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9689.599s">So</a> it's sort of this cyclical process that really keep asking those questions of yourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9694.622s">Here</a> are the goals we want to accomplish. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9696.783s">Here</a> are the resources we're gonna put toward it. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9698.964s">Did</a> we get where we wanted to go with the resources? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9701.825s">If</a> we did, let's continue moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9704.006s">If</a> we didn't, then we need to think differently about how we do resource allocation. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9708.548s">So</a> that's all of sort of tonight's presentations kind of wrapped up in one tiny little package in terms of <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9717.361s">how</a> we put those things together. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9719.503s">And</a> as we think about that, oftentimes people are looking to the business office for how to spend the funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9726.187s">We</a> are not advocates of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9728.188s">We</a> think that the budget belongs in the hands of the people who run the district, most importantly, the people who are closest to the classrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9737.034s">So</a> your principals, your directors who are really directly involved with the act of teaching and learning, those are the people in whose hands the budget should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9748.337s">What</a> we do in our work is we advise people, we tell you if you have the money or you don't have the money, and we advise you about ways that you can make use of all of the funds that you get, whether it's your local appropriation, any of your grants, those kinds of other resources that are out there, revolving accounts and whatnot, to be able to put those pieces together to get a comprehensive budget picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9771.69s">But</a> it really should be in the hands of the people who are closest to the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9775.932s">So</a> again, that's part of what, <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9778.287s">beginning</a> this process earlier allows to have happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9781.368s">You</a> can take a look at the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9782.608s">How</a> are our kids doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9783.869s">Obviously,</a> you're going to be gathering baseline data right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9786.929s">And</a> then say, OK, what do we want to do in the first year of this strategic plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9791.471s">And</a> what resources do we need to get us to that first year end game? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9796.492s">And</a> then measure the effectiveness of those resources on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9800.353s">And</a> if things are going well, move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9803.074s">If</a> they're not, then reassess and reevaluate on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9809.751s">You're</a> on. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9810.592s">Thanks.</a> 
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9962.836s">And</a> it is a long process. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9964.598s">It</a> will take you probably a good six to 12 months to get this fully up and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9969.461s">So</a> be prepared for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9971.663s">It</a> is arduous. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9974.245s">And</a> making sure that not only the initial training goes on for staff who are going to be using it, but that there's ongoing training <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9981.142s">that</a> you invest in to make sure that, again, the features that are available through something that's far more robust can be available to you to make the accounting system easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9993.408s">When</a> you have multiple systems, there is opportunity for error. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9997.21s">There's</a> no way around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9999.852s">And</a> if you're trying to do things like, I have done step and lane changes in a spreadsheet, it is not easy work. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10007.335s">It's</a> very time consuming. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10011.12s">an</a> opportunity for error. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10012.46s">So,</a> you know, the fortunate thing at TMS is we work together as a team. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10016.502s">So</a> you do your work and you have someone else check it. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10019.703s">And</a> oftentimes we do find errors if we have to do it manually, because it is just such a difficult task to be able to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10026.865s">So</a> to be able to say to the financial software, can you please roll everybody over and it just does it. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10034.492s">And</a> you know that the algorithms are in the background to support that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10038.634s">It</a> just makes it a whole lot easier and a whole lot more accurate as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10042.455s">And</a> if there's any one thing we know in this business, it's pay needs to be accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10050.018s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10051.319s">So</a> just some final conclusions from the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10056.792s">You</a> know, as you've gone through tonight's presentations, you are a large and complex district with a diverse student population, certainly. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10069.023s">But</a> now you have really a strong professional team in place, both at the business office level. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10076.99s">I</a> can't say enough for your business office staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10080.233s">They're</a> very competent and very, <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10083.244s">caring</a> people. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10084.044s">They</a> want to do right by the school district and right by the children that you educate. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10088.246s">They</a> really do. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10089.907s">So</a> my hat is off to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10091.448s">I</a> think Alan would certainly echo that sentiment as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10094.529s">Very</a> professional, really wanting to do the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10098.39s">So</a> you've got now a good administrative team in place that's working collaboratively. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10103.993s">So</a> I think this is the moment for you to be able to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10109.455s">The</a> challenges will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10111.905s">difficult</a> because it is a change of the way of doing business and that's always hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10116.468s">But</a> I think if you're willing to do the work, I think you'll find that, you know, that's going to really just pay off for you in ways that are amazingly wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10127.775s">And</a> it was just interesting as I was looking on your website just to see about policies, which your policy manual is in really good place around the business practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10137.502s">So</a> that was not something we had a concern about by any stretch of the imagination. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10141.592s">But</a> just noticing that, you know, your tagline at the top is that you are curing educational partnership of school, family and community. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10149.418s">And</a> that's what it will take to be able to just build a really strong school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10153.921s">And</a> I think you're really right on the right path. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10156.283s">And</a> we hope that this information will help you move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10160.226s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10162.708s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10165.65s">Member</a> Van der Kloot and Member Graham.
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10234.393s">But</a> you can't blame me for trying, though.
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10274.228s">And</a> it depends on the number of user licenses you have, the number of employees that have to be processed through the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10280.652s">So</a> it's really, <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10282.802s">dependent</a> on your specific instance. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10286.543s">So</a> again, as Alan has reminded me, that I don't think I would do you a good service by trying to give you a number at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10296.987s">But</a> there are several major players out there that we have worked with at TMS that I think you can certainly evaluate for your specific needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10307.05s">But</a> that would certainly do a great job for you and make things much more efficient than
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10323.478s">I</a> do believe that he and Mr. Parkett have had that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10326.32s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10326.78s">Okay,</a> that's true. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10328.862s">You're</a> on the spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10332.565s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10335.007s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10338.098s">Thank</a> you for your report. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10340.279s">I</a> just had a couple of clarifying questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10343.341s">Is</a> it standard practice that school committee, school expenditures would require authorization from city hall? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10354.607s">It's</a> a great question. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10355.847s">And</a> some of it depends on city charters and how things are written. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10360.95s">Some</a> of it, again, it's sort of district specific and municipality specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10367.957s">Um,</a> you know, right now we're doing a lot of work for the Greenfield public schools, which is a small city, certainly the size of, by any stretch of the imagination. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10378.619s">Um,</a> but most of the, um, purchases, you know, daily purchase orders and whatever are processed on the school side with good, what we call in the business internal controls. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10390.702s">So</a> we have people who put forward requisitions that get signed. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10396.383s">Um,</a> you know, we have, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10398.19s">bookkeeper</a> who then processes them, sends them to the business administrator, you know, who then verifies and so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10406.332s">So</a> there's internal controls along the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10408.873s">I</a> think that's the key issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10411.394s">For</a> example, in Greenfield, however, it's a big procurement. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10414.154s">We</a> work with the city procurement officer to make sure that that process is all done in the way that it should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10421.516s">So</a> I would say that, you know, your city charter may govern some of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10427.825s">you</a> know, not having seen it, I can't speak to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10431.046s">But</a> again, you know, it's how much of the routine things could be done in the school department internally with a good set of internal controls. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10440.767s">And</a> again, you have a great staff who could certainly provide that check and balance for each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10444.948s">So</a> it's again, how do you put those processes into place to make them work efficiently and well? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10451.949s">And</a> Mr. Murphy, are you aware whether the charter outlines that as a requirement where the mayor
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10463.382s">I</a> would assume finance laws, but I don't think the charter is only a couple pages long. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10467.184s">I</a> don't think the charter outlines it.
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10553.631s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10554.211s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10555.471s">And</a> I think the other question or clarification I just wanted from you both is the budget system that you're talking about, is it a requirement that the city and schools would need to implement together <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10571.912s">or</a> is it possible that the school district could pursue an implementation to make its own shop efficient with or serve with or without the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10584.78s">I'm</a> just trying to understand, is it like a package deal? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10587.242s">Is</a> it recommended to be a package deal? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10590.323s">And</a> what do you give up if that is not the case?
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10666.53s">And</a> there are reporting requirements obviously on the school side to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education as there are reporting requirements on the municipal side and those do cross paths and end-of-the-year reports so schools are required to report on the city's contribution to the school's efforts and likewise on the municipal side <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10691.002s">the</a> city reports also to the Department of, Division of Local Services, how they're expending funds in the name of the city and also on the school side. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10702.426s">So</a> having a common software to work with allows for that reporting to be pretty seamless between the city side and the school side. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10711.489s">Most</a> districts I work in, I've worked in, that is the case that they do share the same platform because it just makes it easier <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10718.855s">again,</a> and more efficient on both sides of the ledger. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10722.619s">And</a> I just have two more questions, if that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10726.803s">So</a> my first question is, you mentioned a six to 12 month implementation window, and as a systems implementer in government, that is like lightning fast. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10737.414s">So</a> I'm just curious, why is that <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10742.315s">the</a> normal experience of implementing such a software? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10745.237s">I</a> mean, usually in a complex organization, which certainly the city of Medford qualifies because of all of its disparities across like departments who do completely different things, all kinds of different structures, lots of different like kind of cross sections, like you're looking typically at like 12 to 18. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10764.867s">Is</a> there a reason why these systems implement so fast? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10768.469s">Or</a> is that just like the best case scenario? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10771.565s">Um,</a> probably best case scenario, obviously, the smaller the entity, the shorter the period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10777.006s">Right</a> now we are working with Windsor Connecticut public schools that just started a implementation process of one of these systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10788.249s">And</a> it's going to be about a year by the time the town and the school department have all of the training and all of the integrations that need to be in a city the size of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10798.271s">It</a> could be more like the 12 to 18 month window. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10801.768s">sure</a> okay thank you and my last question i think is for mr murphy um mr parkett would like to potentially answer one of your questions we already asked so why don't we give him a chance and i'll go back to you mr parkett uh yes good evening everyone uh i apologize for not being able to make it in person um just one of the things i'll say regarding that timeline yes
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10871.867s">And</a> many of the systems now have the ability to easily import what you can export from what you currently have and dump it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10880.129s">And</a> so that does, again, you're not trying to build it from scratch. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10883.47s">So</a> that's also something that'll be helpful along the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10888.251s">And</a> my last question, you all alluded to lots of things that are already happening because the change of leadership happened earlier this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10897.654s">Is</a> this procurement something that is actively in the works or is this <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10902.532s">not</a> yet moving forward.
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11002.808s">And</a> what else I make a motion to approve the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11007.029s">Miss</a> it on file sure section to replace which one. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11013.57s">Okay,</a> motion to place the report on file by member Graham, seconded by member McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11020.333s">Roll</a> call. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11021.033s">All</a> in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11024.635s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11025.095s">All</a> opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11025.675s">This</a> is received and placed on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11028.597s">Thank</a> you so much for being with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11029.977s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11438.212s">Thank</a> you for this opportunity to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11439.712s">It's</a> really nice to see everybody in person and see everyone's face. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11444.378s">So</a> this is a really exciting opportunity for me personally, of course, but I think for the district, I think it's just a way to bring together terrific departments that are already working well and working well together, but it's just sort of formalizing the communication between departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11459.644s">It's</a> sort of formalizing, if there's a request for information from one department to the other, I can be there to sort of facilitate the urgency of it, and it's not piling more work on <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11473.939s">and</a> it's making it clearer what's urgent and what's not urgent. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11478.282s">So</a> I think it's just a way to improve our communications. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11481.405s">I</a> really like that this presentation is following the strategic plan presentation, because I think that these things dovetail really nicely. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11489.05s">I</a> think that a lot of the student support is going to be happening here. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11494.754s">Family</a> engagement happens at every level. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11496.495s">The</a> principal is doing family engagement in all of their outreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11499.498s">The</a> teachers constantly, the guidance Councilors, adjustment Councilors, <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11503.03s">this</a> new re-engagement team will be there to just sort of fill in some of those cracks, prevent cracks from happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11509.772s">I</a> think, you know, when I, I think you guys have heard me say this before, when I hire for the before and after school program, I always say to them, it just takes that one adult to be the change in any student's life. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11520.575s">And</a> isn't it exciting that you might be that one adult, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11523.135s">So</a> if it doesn't happen to be the principal or the teacher or the guidance Councilor, maybe it's somebody from this re-engagement team that will make a connection with the student or make a connection with the family <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11532.648s">to</a> build the necessary trust to re-engage them back into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11536.71s">So</a> I love the idea that we're putting together a team because we'll be able to get people's human strengths and experience and kind of put it together into a nice circle like this, like a puzzle. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11546.476s">So,</a> you know, we're gonna do that marketing that we mentioned in the, I think that's in the ACE of ACEs, you know, get our marketing together so that we can do a better job of explaining to families what our public schools offer, that they're not getting at charter schools, that they're not getting at parochial schools, <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11561.76s">And</a> I think that that's a way that we can really hyper focus all eight hours of our day and beyond as we all know that you know teachers and people in the schools don't have because they're focused on curriculum instruction as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11574.743s">So</a> we're everybody that we've looked at so far for that's applied for this job has had <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11582.025s">has</a> mentioned social work, has mentioned restorative justice values, and that's really exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11587.389s">It's</a> all very positive, it's all very strength-based, and it's all really away from that punitive, that truancy officer driving down trying to catch the kid, going to the mall. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11598.278s">We're</a> totally moved away from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11600.419s">It's</a> really about establishing relationships, figuring out if there's a student not coming to school, figuring out why, and then meeting their needs, connecting them to the resources they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11609.466s">So</a> I'm very excited, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11612.774s">It's</a> gonna be very successful.
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11759.999s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11761.039s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11763.4s">Member</a> Graham, Member Ruseau, Member McLaughlin, Member Van de Vroegh. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11768.962s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11769.642s">This</a> is exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11771.682s">You</a> know, we've talked throughout the budget process about a couple of different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11775.963s">So</a> one is sort of students needing more, especially sort of into <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11781.885s">as</a> we start the next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11783.086s">And</a> we've also talked about the need to revisit our own organizational structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11790.149s">And</a> I feel like this sort of starts to do both of those things at the same time, which is really exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11797.933s">But</a> I was just curious whether you had received any feedback from the administrative team as you created this and what that feedback was.
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11959.977s">Thank</a> you, Member McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11961.178s">And</a> Member Van der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11963.84s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11964.421s">Thank</a> you for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11965.482s">It</a> is very exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11967.244s">It's</a> long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11970.046s">Family</a> and community engagement is critical throughout any business and district to engage all your stakeholders. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11978.061s">You</a> know, I know you said we'll see where we are in a few years, but if we're building relationships, I certainly don't think that we're going to be able to cut them off after a few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11985.006s">So</a> that's encouraging. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11986.727s">And</a> we'll have to find a way to make sure that we continue this and make this happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11990.09s">But</a> I wanted to ask, I guess, about the interdepartmental collaboration and the tactical team that you're building. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11996.815s">A</a> few things. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11998.676s">One</a> is obviously the re-engagement specialist. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12002.159s">And</a> I wonder if there's, you know, just sort of the name of it, but we're not, <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12007.413s">just</a> thinking preventative, we're thinking proactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12010.694s">And</a> so re-engagement feels like to me, we're talking about, oh, people have become disengaged and now we have to go and re-engage them, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12016.976s">We</a> don't wanna get to that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12018.196s">We</a> wanna be proactive and really start. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12020.537s">And</a> I know that we have a year that we're reflecting on where people have been disengaged. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12023.557s">So</a> I just sort of wanna make sure that we're focusing on the proactive and to that end, the school in Maine audit that we were able to have recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12034.12s">and</a> looking at that family and community engagement audit and being able to, it's late in the end of the year and the end of the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12040.621s">So</a> we had talked about having some sort of presentation around that in September, around what that audit really showed, how we're proactively marrying to our strategic plan in this tactical team would be really great. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12053.603s">And</a> then obviously I know that you guys are looking at diversity. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12058.164s">And</a> so we're more thinking about our most vulnerable populations, as you were saying, ensuring that we're reaching them <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12063.89s">you</a> know, through and by people who they identify with, and that we're considering that as we're picking up. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12070.294s">And</a> I'm sure you are, but I just wanted to, yeah, put that out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12073.917s">Thank</a> you, very exciting.
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12128.896s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12129.357s">Member</a> van de Klook? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12130.498s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12343.939s">Motion</a> for approval my second seconded by member Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12348.523s">All</a> those in favor.
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12350.065s">Opposed.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12351.006s">Paper</a> passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12352.967s">Thank</a> you both. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12353.348s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12541.269s">Motion</a> is on the floor, seconded by Member Kreatz.
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12552.535s">Great</a> job. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12553.155s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12554.976s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12558.037s">We</a> have next up proposal of dates for school committee meetings is school year 2021-2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12565.161s">Dr.</a> Maurice-Edouard-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12566.942s">Motion</a> for approval by member Mr. Stone, seconded by member Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12570.123s">All</a> those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12573.205s">Member</a> Ruseau.
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12605.188s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12605.548s">8th</a> and 15th then.
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12614.134s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12614.634s">Your</a> microphone's on. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12615.575s">Is</a> that? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12615.835s">All</a> those in favor?
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12629.002s">Number</a> 10, I believe it's communications. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12636.207s">And</a> then we have new business. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12637.388s">Number</a> one is the request for one week extension from the advisory committee to rename the Columbus Elementary School offered by myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12645.273s">I</a> did speak to the chair and they have, <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12649.065s">working</a> extremely hard on a 30-minute presentation plus for us next week, and I know they're putting a lot into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12655.432s">So</a> they're meeting, I believe, Thursday this week to finalize that, and they'll be here next Monday, the 14th.
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12692.524s">It</a> goes against our policy, if I may, through the chair, because we did say they could extend up through July 31st.
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12871.726s">If</a> I may, through the chair, I think we give them the benefit of the doubt. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12874.106s">And</a> if we choose on the 14th to pick a name out of those three, and we choose to do it, that means all of us would be prepared to have read any research that they have available. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12884.489s">But</a> I'm not prepared to vote to definitely pick a name if they needed another couple of weeks, because we do are going to have potentially one more meeting, short meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12894.491s">But</a> still, I want to give them that opportunity.
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12898.532s">Member</a> Ruseau?
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12937.732s">So</a> and if we don't vote on the 14th, if we don't have any other meetings, obviously, for the summer, then we're talking about September. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12944.535s">So</a> I just want to make sure that I'm understanding that the implication if there's not, you know, if there if there's a request for another extension or something like that, I want to give the benefit of the doubt to looking forward to the presentation on 14th. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12959.959s">So</a> I just want to ensure that they have enough time to do the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12963.681s">And</a> it seems that they've been working on it for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12965.823s">So</a> I'm excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12966.463s">It</a> seems three names they should be able to do a presentation for the 14th, which is next week.
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13002.248s">I</a> think that's what we're debating right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13006.35s">We're</a> debating member Ruseau's amendment to vote on it no matter what. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13010.595s">point</a> of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13011.315s">I'm</a> sorry, I didn't hear miss. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13012.695s">I</a> didn't hear him through the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13013.756s">I</a> didn't hear him. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13014.176s">She's</a> asking a question about next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13016.776s">We're</a> definitely getting the presentation, which is their hope. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13019.877s">And</a> I know they're working hard on it and that's what they've asked for an extension. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13023.717s">She's</a> also asking if we're going to be, when we, after we get the presentation, I'm going to be voting on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13027.898s">But</a> that's what I'm, thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13029.958s">I'm</a> trying to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13030.999s">Are</a> we scheduled for another meeting after the 14th currently? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13034.039s">Currently?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13034.519s">No,</a> we're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13035.319s">So</a> very well might need one because of <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13040.224s">you</a> know, the ESSER funding.
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13135.82s">How</a> do we deliver that? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13136.501s">I</a> like that amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13137.621s">We</a> can respond to them in the morning that we approve the extension to the 14th, that we'd like a fair presentation, however long that may be on the 14th, because we'd like to take a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13151.147s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13153.087s">Is</a> that your motion?
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13176.705s">We</a> could also say an even number of slides, and it doesn't have to be lengthy. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13181.649s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13182.169s">It</a> doesn't need. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13183.25s">Whatever</a> they get to, Thursday night, they get to, and we want them to be presented to. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13187.613s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13187.994s">I'm</a> really looking forward to hearing <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13190.128s">the</a> presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13190.928s">The</a> motion is on the floor as amended by Member Van der Kloot, seconded by... Can we restate the motion?
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13202.194s">The</a> motion is request for one week extension from the advisory committee to remain in Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13208.216s">And</a> Member Van der Kloot's amendment is that we send a message to the committee tomorrow that we would like a <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13218.329s">equal</a> amount of slides, however that may be, and whatever is ready at the end of their meeting on Thursday evening to present on the 14th so that we can pick a new name for the Columbus School during that meeting.
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13235.815s">Their</a> meeting's tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13237.715s">Okay,</a> their meeting tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13239.236s">So</a> that would give them the opportunity to schedule another meeting if they needed it on Thursday or Friday so that they could have it ready for us <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13246.911s">Seconded</a> by member Rousseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13248.452s">Rousseau,</a> all those in favor?

 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7180.362s">I</a> just want to make everybody aware on this eviction thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7187.807s">So</a> there is a process in housing and it's not easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7191.049s">There</a> was an article last week in the Globe that I hope some people read it and caught the last paragraph. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7197.994s">In</a> order for the landlords to be able to collect <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7201.598s">the</a> federal money, they have to issue the eviction notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7205.08s">They</a> do not want to evict people, but in order for them to be able to collect the arrears, they've got to be able to put something on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7212.985s">Nobody's</a> trying to put people in the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7215.007s">Housing</a> Court has reached out to the realtor industry, and they are recruiting hundreds. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7220.41s">across</a> the state in order to mediate between the tenants and the landlords. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7226.156s">So</a> when the landlord is able to access that federal money, part of getting that money is an agreement that they're not going to evict the tenant. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7235.485s">If</a> it's just a money issue, if it's a legal issue that they're breaking the law and they're making people unsafe, I think that's a different situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7242.992s">But</a> I am on the Housing Sustainability Task Force group there and it hasn't met since last May. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7249.94s">I've</a> been asking when are we going to meet because I'm really concerned for everyone in Medford, the tenants and the property owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7257.789s">We</a> have a lot of people that can't pay their mortgages and one of the best things that the city can do is <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7263.636s">is</a> to be able to compile resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7265.838s">And,</a> you know, Alicia Hunt and I have had numerous conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7268.96s">She's</a> pulled together an awful lot of stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7271.321s">I've</a> been sending her stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7272.662s">Everyone</a> wants to help each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7274.744s">But</a> what I'm afraid of is, like, the state purposely backed off on extending their eviction moratorium because of the federal one that was put out. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7283.57s">And</a> the federal government did extend today. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7286.672s">they</a> extended theirs until the end of January. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7290.073s">So</a> I feel like if, as a city, we start getting involved in that and start making these home rules, it's actually gonna hurt our property owners that they're not going to be able to access the funds, because at the end of the day, they still need to pay their mortgage. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7302.555s">Nobody</a> really wants to put anybody in the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7305.195s">And</a> a lot of our landlords in Medford, they're elderly people, and they're relying on the rent in order to actually live and buy their food. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7313.537s">So</a> it's important that we can keep the resources there for everybody, the tenants and the landlords. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7318.939s">And</a> I don't think that we're helping everybody if the city steps in and puts an eviction moratorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7324.362s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_ODT3XVbBhL4/2024-11-19_ODT3XVbBhL4.html">City Council 09-08-20</a></h2>

 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2911.788s">I'm</a> just asking you to consider working with the parking situation just because the housing situation is that dire right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2919.057s">With</a> COVID, you know, a lot of the younger generation has all moved home. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2923.563s">They</a> would love to have an in-law apartment in their mom's house if they still have some independence. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2927.848s">So</a> there are so many great ideas and so many places that you can go with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2932.01s">And</a> if you could also consider what the city of Boston has done, they've taken accessory dwelling unit and they've actually called it an additional dwelling unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2940.514s">And</a> there is some legislation that's online that you can get right off of the city of Boston website. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2945.956s">And</a> if you would consider that, I think that it would help a lot of people be able to afford to stay in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2952.459s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2952.839s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6526.784s">Hello,</a> Mr. Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6528.465s">So,</a> Zach, this is a great paragraph. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6532.128s">Nobody</a> wants anybody homeless. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6533.71s">I</a> think we're all on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6536.252s">However,</a> there's an awful lot put in here, and it's very compounded. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6541.075s">And</a> what my eyes are going to is a rent freeze. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6544.478s">So</a> if we have a rent freeze we're going to have people in our city that can't pay their mortgages I cannot tell you how many people in our city own two family homes that are 80 years old Relying on their rent payments in order to be able to buy their medicines and buy their food Roberta, I agree with you 100. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6564.863s">We</a> do need a task force <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6567.504s">And</a> I think that we need people from the entire circle that touch housing on this task force, so everybody can show what they're seeing. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6575.988s">The</a> landlords and the tenants, and I've talked to so many in the last week, because Adam, I also got a lot of phone calls from tenants who thought that they didn't have to pay their rent this month. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6587.133s">Um,</a> so we need the landlords and the tenants to work it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6590.517s">They</a> are working it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6592.861s">I</a> think when we put government restrictions on housing and on people's private property, it just kind of makes them angry and it's not good. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6602.114s">You</a> know, nobody is looking to evict tenants today. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6604.796s">I</a> have not heard one person say to me that they want to evict. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6607.858s">I</a> have landlords that are very, very afraid of not getting their rents. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6612.241s">I</a> have landlords that have had tenants serve them notice, and they can't go in their property to re-rent it or to sell it right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6619.646s">So</a> I think, again, if we can get everybody into one group and we can come up with a solution that benefits everybody, that could work. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6627.491s">Freezing</a> rents doesn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6629.051s">The</a> only thing that's being offered right now from a lot of mortgage companies is forbearance. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6633.752s">Forbearance</a> means we're going to let you not pay your rent for three months, or your mortgage, but in three months, we want it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6640.953s">So</a> if it's a deferment, it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6642.594s">It</a> goes to the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6643.814s">But</a> again, if we have a housing task force, we can get the message out to people, we're not going to end up in a mess.

 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7262.241s">So</a> I guess my question is, since it's on the table here and you guys all might vote on it, do you have a problem with a homeowner that wants to allow us to show their home? <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7272.566s">So</a> if they live in their home, and Zach, I get what you're getting, no tenant wants to feel like somebody is going to barge into their home and they're going to feel unsafe. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7281.611s">However,</a> if a homeowner puts their house on the market, is it okay for the homeowner to allow somebody in? <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7287.894s">Are</a> you okay with that?
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8282.732s">So</a> the eviction thing, the way that it's written, evictions are not easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8287.138s">So</a> to say nobody's going to be evicted if you mass murder somebody and somebody wants to evict you, you're gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8292.866s">If</a> you're dealing drugs out of the apartment, there's a two-year-old that lives downstairs, you should be gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8297.953s">The</a> House and the Senate are already dealing with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8300.255s">The</a> House bill is 4615. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8302.817s">The</a> Senate is bill 2621. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8305.559s">And</a> they are trying to come with a consensus. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8308.001s">I</a> think once this is already on the state level, we as a city need to back off and let our state legislatures do what they need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8316.067s">I</a> do believe that your heart is in the right place, that we do need a housing task force. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8320.15s">We</a> want to protect people. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8321.631s">But</a> at the same instance, we don't want to do it at the financial, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8327.606s">rhetoric</a> of the property owner either. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8330.028s">So</a> the property owners aren't bad people, but they are the people that are paying you the taxes that you said in January that they wanted you to raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8338.193s">They</a> don't want you to raise them, but they're paying all your increased fees for everything else in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8343.676s">And</a> I think at some point we need to back off as a city and let the state legislators do their job.
 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9618.99s">President</a> Falco, so just for everybody's information, the city of Medford does have a page on the website which relates to everything that we've been talking about tonight with resources for tenants and homeowners relating to foreclosures, evictions, if they can't pay their rent. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9637.059s">There</a> are a ton of nonprofits out there that can help people <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9642.382s">We</a> are just at the very beginning of this entire thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9646.423s">But</a> there's so many resources, and the city of Medford has actually compiled quite a bit of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9651.405s">So</a> maybe we can look at those. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9653.045s">I</a> love the idea of increasing the RAF funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9655.406s">I</a> think it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9656.967s">But</a> we have a lot of other resources as well that I just want everybody to be aware of.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_3EjMDeUU8A8/2024-11-19_3EjMDeUU8A8.html">City Council 03-31-20</a></h2>

 <p>[Kelly Catallo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6814.377s">Kelly</a> Catalo, 46 Otis Street, Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6817.979s">First</a> of all, I will state I am a tenant. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6820.361s">However,</a> I am going to ask you not to put any stricter, put anything out there that the governor hasn't already done. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6828.166s">I</a> think Governor Baker has been very responsive to the people of Massachusetts, and I think for each city to go about <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6835.093s">making</a> different rules, we're going to have a bigger problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6839.094s">In</a> regards to telling people that they don't have to pay rent, not every mortgage is underwritten by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6846.556s">And</a> right now, those are the only people that can call and get a stay on their mortgage. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6851.118s">And</a> what's happening is people are being told at the end of those three months that they have to pay the whole thing in full. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6856.659s">So</a> if people don't pay their rent, the mortgages can't get paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6859.98s">I</a> think that the stimulus package in itself is going to be aid to everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6865.542s">So</a> I'd really rather you didn't do any stricter restrictions than what the governor has already done. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6869.983s">Today,</a> he turned around and actually made real estate, residential, and commercial services as deemed essentials, which does give me the right to go open up my office again. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6879.707s">I'm</a> not going to do it because I don't feel like we need to. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6882.408s">We</a> can work remotely. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6883.468s">And</a> we are working with precautions <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6887.149s">So</a> I don't think that we need any stricter guidelines than that either. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6890.43s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2019-06-26_9OsqmilNK4I/2019-06-26_9OsqmilNK4I.html">Medford School Committee meeting June 24, 2019</a></h2>
