    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1691.462s">[Bears]</a>: Madam President, motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1705.213s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1726.588s">[Bears]</a>: Madam President, motion to suspend the rules to take papers 22-584, 22-609, 22-603, and 22-604.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1729.509s">[Bears]</a>: 603, 604.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1730.249s">[Bears]</a>: And 584.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1769.779s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1810.773s">[Bears]</a>: And motion for a brief summary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1837.093s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2091.724s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2106.35s">[Bears]</a>: My intention was to 609 next that's the eviction license.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2260.348s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3568.517s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3569.878s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Penny, for reaching out to me to make this presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3573.441s">[Bears]</a>: I think it's really important for us to hear and for anyone who's, you know, in the community to hear the great work that we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3582.407s">[Bears]</a>: I think this is really showing how we're bringing together so much of the response work and whether we're talking about climate or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3592.984s">[Bears]</a>: you know, substance use disorder or food insecurity or housing insecurity, all the other issues that we know so many people in our community are facing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3601.07s">[Bears]</a>: But also just bringing the community together in general and building a more resilient community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3605.153s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, I think something that we have been talking about and will continue to be talking about is social emotional support for young people in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3612.318s">[Bears]</a>: And also, you know, making sure that seniors have connection to the resources that they need in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3617.603s">[Bears]</a>: And I just think that this is really showing that there's an intentional approach and that the staff on the ground are really doing amazing work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3624.309s">[Bears]</a>: not just in bringing in funding so that we can do this, which I know is really tough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3629.352s">[Bears]</a>: And one of the reasons that it hadn't been done before is we have huge budgetary problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3634.234s">[Bears]</a>: So I'm glad that there's a pool of money that you're able to access for this, but also how we can really embed it throughout all of our public institutions, from our public schools, to our city departments, to our nonprofit organizations going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3649.437s">[Bears]</a>: It's really impressive work, really thankful to you and everyone who's been working on it and obviously continue to love to support and help out where I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3658.782s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4519.453s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4521.677s">[Bears]</a>: And I also do recognize that Councilor Knight did submit<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4525.345s">[Bears]</a>: an amendment to this paper requesting that the documents be presented to the council in advance of a presentation and that the presentation be tabled to the next regularly scheduled meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4535.394s">[Bears]</a>: So I don't know what you have tonight for us, Director Dickinson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4539.037s">[Bears]</a>: I'd be happy to hear kind of a short update, but I do agree that in order for us to be fully prepared for a budget presentation and financial update, having the documents in advance would be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4548.965s">[Bears]</a>: So I don't want to speak for council tonight beyond that, but I do understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4553.743s">[Bears]</a>: a concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4554.624s">[Bears]</a>: So, you know, I'll just put that out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4723.039s">[Bears]</a>: They're never presented to us, Bob.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4782.851s">[Bears]</a>: 2020 to the present is what we're requesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4910.913s">[Bears]</a>: Point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4913.153s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4915.534s">[Bears]</a>: If we could, I think it sounds like we should just get on paper right now what we're asking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4939.294s">[Bears]</a>: It's not exclusive to the finance department, Bob.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4942.656s">[Bears]</a>: It's almost, unless we make the outreach directly, every paper that we submit to the mayor's office to almost any department, we're not getting the response in a timely manner or a complete manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4952.744s">[Bears]</a>: So I just wanna put that out there and I'm not gonna ask you to say that, I'll say it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4958.208s">[Bears]</a>: The first thing I wanna just get on, so yes, I think the first thing we'd really like to see would be the AP warrants<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4965.939s">[Bears]</a>: from January 2020 to present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4968.68s">[Bears]</a>: And I know that's probably a pretty big file, but I think we'd all like to see it electronically and also to be sent to the clerk to be delivered to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4981.086s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4981.366s">[Bears]</a>: And I mean, we can also send you an example of what the previous finance or finance director gave us for...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5004.251s">[Bears]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5004.411s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, the other thing we can send you is Aleesha Nunley Benjamin did provide us with copies of what we call warrant articles and we can provide you an example of that so that you can see what those reports were like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5018.019s">[Bears]</a>: And then the two things that you said that you have with you tonight, you said you had a quarter one<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5028.228s">[Bears]</a>: And then the other thing that you said is you have revenue projections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5038.535s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5044.918s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5059.301s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5060.301s">[Bears]</a>: And I don't mean this to be exhaustive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5061.582s">[Bears]</a>: I'm sure other Councilors are going to have other items, but basically what would be also very helpful is if you could take anything, anything that we request tonight, send them to us in a digital format and the clerk in a digital format, he can provide it to us in a print format.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5075.072s">[Bears]</a>: And then if we can have that, you know, maybe by the end of this week,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5080.334s">[Bears]</a>: then we could have a full presentation from you in January, as Councilor Knight had requested, where we've had time to review the documents in advance to ask, have our questions ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5116.309s">[Bears]</a>: I'm through, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5740.47s">[Bears]</a>: Just amend the motion to request that the finance director submit to the clerk in the council and digital format, the documents requested and documents that we listed out earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5752.817s">[Bears]</a>: And I'll leave it at that but I do think we should try to schedule this early in January and try to figure out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5822.266s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7482.764s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7486.166s">[Bears]</a>: Nobody's happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7489.108s">[Bears]</a>: There's disagreements about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7491.65s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think there's any single person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7493.411s">[Bears]</a>: And if there is, they got to get checked out who was happy about what happened yesterday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7500.233s">[Bears]</a>: I think everyone agrees and agreed six months ago, or two months ago, or two days ago, that there are things that need to be improved, that there are problems that need to be solved, that we're not always, and even if we had solved them, that we're not always going to get it 100% right 100% of the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7521.246s">[Bears]</a>: Now, how we,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7528.559s">[Bears]</a>: address those problems, how we build processes, how we improve systems, how we address systemic challenges is by putting forward solutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7538.125s">[Bears]</a>: The thing that we're talking about in resolutions coming later than this are some ideas around that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7546.43s">[Bears]</a>: But I think also it's important to look back at what we've heard from our school committee and school administration, what we've heard from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7557.56s">[Bears]</a>: this council, when it comes to the budget and the funding of our schools, when it comes to the resources that we need, when it comes to the resources that we need in this moment, when we know, hey, there was violence at Medford High School when I was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7573.189s">[Bears]</a>: There was violence at Medford High School 30 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7575.931s">[Bears]</a>: And we can talk about certain numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7577.732s">[Bears]</a>: The one number that hasn't been talked about any of this is actually looking at the trends and data on this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7583.561s">[Bears]</a>: But the one thing we do know is whether it's Medford or a neighboring community or every community in Massachusetts or every community in this country is that student supports are deeply needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7594.648s">[Bears]</a>: That mental health is a serious issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7597.049s">[Bears]</a>: That conflict resolution and addressing problems in a peaceful manner is a huge problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7603.733s">[Bears]</a>: And that quite frankly, before these things got worse, it was a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7609.276s">[Bears]</a>: It's an even worse problem now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7611.318s">[Bears]</a>: Students are walking out because they recognize it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7613.829s">[Bears]</a>: Students are crying out because they know that they need help or they know someone who needs help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7618.572s">[Bears]</a>: It's a question of resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7620.993s">[Bears]</a>: The first thing I thought about when I ran for office was the funding for our schools three years ago, that was before the pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7626.056s">[Bears]</a>: It was my first concern in June when we were talking about the fiscal 23 budget and the $2.8 million that got cut from our schools at the last minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7635.401s">[Bears]</a>: And two weeks ago, it was again, where I was focusing my energy and efforts in a resolution that passed this council<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7644.369s">[Bears]</a>: about funding and asking what are the supports?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7646.951s">[Bears]</a>: What are the funding that's needed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7649.693s">[Bears]</a>: Another thing that needs resources and funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7651.815s">[Bears]</a>: We were just talking about it for municipal vulnerability plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7654.498s">[Bears]</a>: We were just talking about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7656.499s">[Bears]</a>: When we talk about this whole city, schools and city side, communications and engagement, the city doesn't invest its budgetary resources in that issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7665.026s">[Bears]</a>: So we have, you know, people scrambling to put something together to get it out when there's an emergency situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7672.475s">[Bears]</a>: We have in a million other situations insufficient resources for communication and engagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7681.26s">[Bears]</a>: So all of these things, no one is happy here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7685.222s">[Bears]</a>: We've all identified problems that we want to solve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7688.324s">[Bears]</a>: We're starting to talk about solutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7690.966s">[Bears]</a>: The big elephant in the room solution that we don't want to zone in on is that we don't have the resources to address the scope of the problems that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7699.57s">[Bears]</a>: And until we are willing to admit that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7702.734s">[Bears]</a>: and engage in a good faith discussion about what is the true scope of resources that we need to invest in our schools and in our community to address the sheer scale of the problems that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7713.763s">[Bears]</a>: We're not going to unify or come together or solve these issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7720.148s">[Bears]</a>: And they are of a scope and scale we could not have imagined four years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7725.212s">[Bears]</a>: So that's the crux of this whole question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7729.275s">[Bears]</a>: We come together in government<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7731.704s">[Bears]</a>: to pool our resources to address our collective problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7735.927s">[Bears]</a>: That is what we do more than anything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7739.39s">[Bears]</a>: And we've clearly identified a collective problem that needs resources and the resources, we are literally unable to put those resources on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7749.538s">[Bears]</a>: Now, I think there are things that we can do and should do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7752.816s">[Bears]</a>: and try to do in the short-term, medium, and long-term with what we have to better target what we have and do the best that we can do with what we have, but that's not going to be enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7767.066s">[Bears]</a>: The other two things I want to talk about here are that we are once again not going to get unified and be on the same page and be able to move forward collectively unless we are moving on a single set of facts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7781.903s">[Bears]</a>: about who has the authority to do what, who has the power to do what, and who sets the rules about what.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7789.849s">[Bears]</a>: The state and the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education set a number of rules about a lot of the things that we're talking about tonight, or have talked about in previous meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7800.457s">[Bears]</a>: The state defines the scope of the authority of the school committee and the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7805.701s">[Bears]</a>: The one place where we truly do have authority<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7809.125s">[Bears]</a>: is on this fundamental core question of funding and the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7813.007s">[Bears]</a>: That is where we can partner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7814.828s">[Bears]</a>: And I know that there's a resolution from Councilor Scarpelli on that question and a resolution from Councilor Collins and I on that question, because that is where we can most and best engage in this discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7826.054s">[Bears]</a>: And I don't say that to limit that there may be other things, but that is where our authority and power lies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7832.738s">[Bears]</a>: And the last thing I'm going to say, people aren't going to be happy about it, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7839.468s">[Bears]</a>: I'm not happy about everything that everyone else has said, so I'm just going to go ahead and say it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7844.011s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know what veiled accusations about national organizations are going to get us anywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7850.516s">[Bears]</a>: When we have information that is not correct out there about why people are making decisions that they're making or what decisions have been made or the policies and rules that actually exist and are actually being followed or should be being followed,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7864.864s">[Bears]</a>: we're never going to get on the same enough page to move forward in a collective way and really talk about having the community and collaborative conversations that we need to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7874.667s">[Bears]</a>: So, you know, I know that that's, that's the nicest way that I can think of to say what I really want to say here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7883.01s">[Bears]</a>: But when we talk about unity, we can't then have the next sentence be something that divides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7891.033s">[Bears]</a>: And I think, again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7894.895s">[Bears]</a>: The thing that we can unify around here, maybe it's not the most heartwarming thing to unify around here is that nobody is happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7904.864s">[Bears]</a>: There are problems and we need to identify and move forward on solutions to those problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7909.748s">[Bears]</a>: And I think if we can do that and accept a single set of facts about what is truly going on, then we are laying the foundation<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7919.284s">[Bears]</a>: to have the substantive conversations and make the real actions that we need so that kids in our schools feel safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7927.086s">[Bears]</a>: I know what it was like to not feel safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7929.647s">[Bears]</a>: I stayed home for a whole week from school because I didn't want to get on the bus because I was attacked when I was in middle school, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7935.709s">[Bears]</a>: And I'm not even equating that to what happened on Monday or what happened to other people, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7941.711s">[Bears]</a>: I experienced that in my family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7944.572s">[Bears]</a>: So we can say that there's a monopoly on the feelings here,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7949.022s">[Bears]</a>: but we know what we know and we know that what we have to put forward is not sufficient at this moment to address the scope of the challenge that we face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7964.408s">[Bears]</a>: And I think the best thing that we can do is to look at the resolutions before us that are solutions focused and ask the people most affected, the students and teachers on the ground to work with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7975.629s">[Bears]</a>: the school committee and the mayor and the school administration and the city council to figure out what we can do in the short term to address funding and what we can do in the long term to make a systemic solution and a systemic approach to make sure that we're addressing this issue in two weeks, in two months, in two years, and in two decades, because we heard last night that there were people who felt that 30 years ago to today, things hadn't been fixed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8003.188s">[Bears]</a>: That's all I wanna say on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8004.728s">[Bears]</a>: Beyond that, I'm not gonna speak to this paper anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8007.389s">[Bears]</a>: I'll speak to the solutions focused resolutions that we have next, and I'll leave it at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8012.75s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9021.462s">[Bears]</a>: I'll be short.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9022.303s">[Bears]</a>: The game is rigged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9024.623s">[Bears]</a>: We can try to change our game plan as much as we want, but when we're talking about city departments and city budgets that in real inflation adjusted dollar terms have less money now than they did in 1980, the game is rigged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9036.245s">[Bears]</a>: So that's the first thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9037.225s">[Bears]</a>: I'm not disputing that there are things we could do immediately to bring people together and try to find solutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9045.107s">[Bears]</a>: I think that's exactly what we have on here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9047.622s">[Bears]</a>: There are things we could do with short money that could make a big impact and make people feel safer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9051.683s">[Bears]</a>: And I think that's what we're asking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9053.523s">[Bears]</a>: But I think the idea that we can fix this whole problem or that the notion of putting more resources, this is just throwing money at the problem, that we can address a problem that has been persistent, that is growing in scale, that is not just unique to Medford, even though we could do what we can in Medford to find unique solutions with what we have through reallocation and additional resources, it's promising something that's unachievable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9077.958s">[Bears]</a>: So I agree, let's do what we can now with short money or no money at all to make people feel safer in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9083.8s">[Bears]</a>: I completely understand and respect that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9086.3s">[Bears]</a>: And I think we have to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9088.161s">[Bears]</a>: But if we're not, again, if we're not thinking about this in a bigger terms of, you know, when we talk about resources, yeah, make people feel safer, I would bet to have some additional resources around the hallways and the bathrooms, because that's clearly been a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9102.444s">[Bears]</a>: It was a problem that came up before what happened yesterday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9105.675s">[Bears]</a>: Obviously it was a problem yesterday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9107.076s">[Bears]</a>: That's something that'll make people feel safer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9109.118s">[Bears]</a>: And we can figure out ways to target resources to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9112.661s">[Bears]</a>: But when we talk about students' mental health and the mental health crisis and the fact that we need dozens of more Councilors at our school, or we need to bring back maybe an assistant principal at the high school, or we have to look at the funding cuts that were made in 2020 or 2023, those are big ticket items that, you know, if we just want to say we'll never get there, then,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9135.905s">[Bears]</a>: All we're going to do is the short money things that make people feel a little bit safer until they don't work anymore or until more kids are facing issues with mental health and conflict resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9145.633s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to stop there because I don't think it's mutually exclusive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9149.075s">[Bears]</a>: I'm not saying we can only do one piece of it and not the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9151.517s">[Bears]</a>: And I don't think anyone else is saying the other way around, but if we don't have that conversation and admit that we're not going to be operating on a set of facts and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9164.235s">[Bears]</a>: under the urgency that we need to be operating under to bring the solutions to bear that we obviously all agree need to be brought to bear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10062.347s">[Bears]</a>: Another challenge that didn't exist 12 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12383.436s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12384.316s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12384.977s">[Bears]</a>: I also want to thank you for coming out to everyone who spoke tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12387.938s">[Bears]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12388.158s">[Bears]</a>: Ripley, you were really good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12392.651s">[Bears]</a>: And the students who spoke last night as well, I think that that takes a lot of courage because you, you're going back there and you know what it's like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12399.672s">[Bears]</a>: And I just want to say too, to President Morell's point, you know, I graduated 2011 from Medford High School, my sister 2016, and there were clicks and bullying and police reports and, you know, issues that we faced in our time at Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12423.281s">[Bears]</a>: I think, again, there's not much more I can add.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12427.201s">[Bears]</a>: People have been experiencing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12428.762s">[Bears]</a>: It's clearly worse now than it's ever been before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12431.204s">[Bears]</a>: And I think we've talked about a lot of the reasons that that's true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12435.166s">[Bears]</a>: And this council and the school committee, and I think everyone involved is, you know, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12442.251s">[Bears]</a>: Ripley talked about resources, seeing every day the teachers and staff not having the resources that they're asking for to help address these problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12450.996s">[Bears]</a>: And I think, again, that's something that for me personally, I think is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12455.814s">[Bears]</a>: What I'm going to keep hammering on is trying to get more resources into the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12459.237s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12848.745s">[Bears]</a>: Point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12850.306s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12852.548s">[Bears]</a>: The idea that we shouldn't contextualize an issue and analyze it to find solutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12860.393s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, yeah, what happened in the past is relevant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12862.475s">[Bears]</a>: You're doing it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12863.415s">[Bears]</a>: So I just want to make that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=13359.802s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=13361.924s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. South.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=13363.246s">[Bears]</a>: I appreciate you acknowledging the national scope of the issue and the need for significant funding, considering the massive underfunding of our city government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=13371.034s">[Bears]</a>: I just had one question, which is, who wrote this document?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=13751.657s">[Bears]</a>: Go ahead, name and address for the record, Andrew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=13784.929s">[Bears]</a>: Let's keep it on topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=13833.817s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Andrew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=13835.717s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Orlando.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=13839.218s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14012.472s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14018.055s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14311.716s">[Bears]</a>: safety, social, emotional health, and support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14482.128s">[Bears]</a>: Completely out of context statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14489.669s">[Bears]</a>: I just said it's completely out of context,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14492.594s">[Bears]</a>: for your political ends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14495.336s">[Bears]</a>: It's incredibly easy for people to take their own politics and map them onto any situation they want and then use it to justify or blame people for results.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14516.195s">[Bears]</a>: When people say that out of context and repeat it and repeat it over again to rile people up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14522.56s">[Bears]</a>: Watch the video you can see for yourself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14809.012s">[Bears]</a>: Motion to read papers 22-614-2261.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14810.953s">[Bears]</a>: We have to dispose, sorry, we just have to dispose of this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14814.815s">[Bears]</a>: It's part of the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14815.776s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14816.336s">[Bears]</a>: Motion to read 22-614-615, 616, 617, and 618.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14817.457s">[Bears]</a>: Merge them all together and a motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14834.949s">[Bears]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14835.17s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14858.558s">[Bears]</a>: I'll do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14919.893s">[Bears]</a>: and I do ask that you read them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15110.969s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15156.607s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15219.625s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15250.356s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15301.505s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15319.951s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15322.853s">[Bears]</a>: Madam President, motion to table until our next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15329.319s">[Bears]</a>: Actually, sorry, if I may, is there Mo Lewis on Zoom?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15348.258s">[Bears]</a>: I don't want to cut you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15350.779s">[Bears]</a>: If you've been here all night, Moe, I don't want to cut you out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15365.364s">[Bears]</a>: I will table the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15366.385s">[Bears]</a>: I'll follow up with him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15376.579s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15477.798s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15559.937s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15605.693s">[Bears]</a>: Madam President, I would move to refer the original paper and the amendments to the Subcommittee on Rules and Ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15642.841s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15723.74s">[Bears]</a>: And correct me if I'm wrong, this is Route 16 eastbound between Main Street and Harvard Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15732.604s">[Bears]</a>: If we could just amend it to reflect Route 16 eastbound between Main Street and the intersection with Harvard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15737.846s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know if it has an official name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15740.227s">[Bears]</a>: Harvard Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15741.147s">[Bears]</a>: It is Route 16.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15758.006s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15770.136s">[Bears]</a>: Madam President, motion to table papers 22610, 22611, and 22612.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15863.843s">[Bears]</a>: You know, it's like government by committee doesn't work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15867.965s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, is that, are we considering that an official communication that our vote is not required?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15873.578s">[Bears]</a>: Because we did ask a question as to whether our voters were part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15880.762s">[Bears]</a>: So not really an answer, just yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15902.01s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=0.748s">[Bears]</a>: Medford City Council Committee of the whole April 23rd 2024 is called the order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=43.619s">[Bears]</a>: And tonight this is the second preliminary budget meeting of the FY 25 budget process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=530.398s">[Bears]</a>: Just to clarify that too, you can go, the Division of Local Services has a great website online where you can see the cherry sheet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=537.0s">[Bears]</a>: You can see the historical cherry sheet and also the estimates of different budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=544.023s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Shane, for giving us a booster for the microphone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=550.846s">[Bears]</a>: And I think the other thing to note, maybe just backing up right to the beginning here, tonight we're basically just talking about the general fund budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=558.189s">[Bears]</a>: we're not talking about water store enterprise and then we're not talking about anything else special revenue funds or other fee fee or grant funded essentially things that are outside of the general fund budget council<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=603.291s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, the way that the state works, so and I worked on a bunch of education legislation, which is the only reason I'm chiming in here, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=611.838s">[Bears]</a>: There is a charter school reimbursement formula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=615.2s">[Bears]</a>: So when a student moves from the public school system to the charter school system, there's a three-year step-down reimbursement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=621.344s">[Bears]</a>: In their first year, I think it's 100%, second year, 80%, third year, 60%, and the year after that, 0%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=627.787s">[Bears]</a>: So we send out over 8 million, I think, or around 8 million a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=634.571s">[Bears]</a>: to charter schools we only get back somewhere in the one to two million dollar range maybe 1.6 I'd have to look at the cherry sheet but it's um it's does not fully reimburse the cost of charter sending and charter sending is our by far the biggest assessment that is placed on the city by the state so that so this is just sorry this is just the quick summary of what revenue we we receive from the state on the bottom<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=716.702s">[Bears]</a>: They're giving us back, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=720.283s">[Bears]</a>: But 631 in the house ways and means.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=722.809s">[Bears]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=723.29s">[Bears]</a>: So it's a total mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=761.016s">[Bears]</a>: I just put up the cherry shoot for a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=762.537s">[Bears]</a>: You might have to put that back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=764.898s">[Bears]</a>: But this is the revenue side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=766.96s">[Bears]</a>: And this is the estimate that Bob was using here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=772.064s">[Bears]</a>: This 34, I'm guessing, if you're using the governor's budget estimate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=777.99s">[Bears]</a>: And then these are the charges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=779.611s">[Bears]</a>: So the T is about $5 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=781.873s">[Bears]</a>: Charter school sending is $8 plus million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=785.236s">[Bears]</a>: Somehow the Taos formula has us paying a lot less, but also getting a lot less back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=791.281s">[Bears]</a>: Sorry to interrupt your share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=796.706s">[Bears]</a>: You may re-share your presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=885.987s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, Councilor Kiley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=899.534s">[Bears]</a>: You can also see that if you go to the Division of Local Services Municipal Finance dashboard,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1028.091s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1070.933s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1071.233s">[Bears]</a>: There's a motion from Councilor to request the new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1074.595s">[Bears]</a>: You want the amounts for the last 3 fiscal years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1101.375s">[Bears]</a>: Great, we will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1103.936s">[Bears]</a>: I have that motion we'll take all the motions at the end of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1105.777s">[Bears]</a>: So we'll have a motion to last 3 years of projections and the actuals for new growth for the property tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1115.083s">[Bears]</a>: The new growth element.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1150.214s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1434.834s">[Bears]</a>: Anyway, it's- Point being, we would like to not have this happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1812.552s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1813.893s">[Bears]</a>: Any questions at this point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1819.217s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, I will say I think that is a, you know, we need to see the expense side of things, but that's almost $10 million more than last year, so we can always do better and do more, but that is a relatively significant number, and I think we should be aware of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1836.929s">[Bears]</a>: Our costs are probably growing faster, and I'm sure that's what the next slides are going to tell us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2212.35s">[Bears]</a>: Do you have a general estimate of across the whole budget what the contractual increases are?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2218.652s">[Bears]</a>: Like a dollar amount?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2253.613s">[Bears]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2293.104s">[Bears]</a>: I think that down the line, as we move through the process, that'll be kind of helpful for us to see and show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2298.428s">[Bears]</a>: You know, I've already got it here at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2300.987s">[Bears]</a>: just with these three, the health insurance and given the pension and workers comp.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2306.91s">[Bears]</a>: So we have 9 million more revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2308.911s">[Bears]</a>: Just those three items is 3.5 out, because that's a fixed cost increase on the benefit side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2316.094s">[Bears]</a>: As we move through the department budgets, we'll be able to see however many millions the contractual obligations to our union and non-union employees cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2324.618s">[Bears]</a>: That's probably millions more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2327.199s">[Bears]</a>: And then we're talking about that 9 million<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2331.167s">[Bears]</a>: increase going away pretty quickly with the cost growth that we have without adding anything new or doing anything more than we're doing right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2340.412s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2445.911s">[Bears]</a>: And along those lines, just essentially when we're in the Group Insurance Commission, the GIC, we are with almost every other city and town buying health insurance with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2456.795s">[Bears]</a>: The idea being that in a larger pool, you pay less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2462.176s">[Bears]</a>: Is this a proposed rate increase or did the Group Insurance Commission actually vote this increase through?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2468.238s">[Bears]</a>: It's been voted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2468.959s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2469.799s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2617.108s">[Bears]</a>: Is the river's edge?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2893.919s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Director Dickinson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2895.821s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to go to Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2897.603s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3155.936s">[Bears]</a>: There's a motion from Councilor Scarpelli to ask if there are any budget shortfalls for departments for FY24.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3163.755s">[Bears]</a>: we'll take that at the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3164.635s">[Bears]</a>: If you want to thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3385.516s">[Bears]</a>: The question I think was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3388.496s">[Bears]</a>: Are there any budget freezes on the city side or any budgets that are expected to be frozen on the city side for fiscal 24?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3395.42s">[Bears]</a>: I believe Director Dickinson answered very clearly no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3398.362s">[Bears]</a>: And you came up to add that there are positions that are currently funded through ARPA that may not be funded in the future, but that that's not going to affect this year's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3410.129s">[Bears]</a>: There's no freezes related to that in the current budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3413.611s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3418.359s">[Bears]</a>: I think on a few things here, just looking at the quarter three actuals and the quarter two actuals, I've been looking at all of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3431.397s">[Bears]</a>: The big six or seven budgets that I'll see, most of the budget is DPW highway, DPW water, sewer, fire, health insurance, pensions, police, and the school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3443.369s">[Bears]</a>: The Metropolitan Public Schools, that's basically the vast majority of the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3448.375s">[Bears]</a>: It seems like we're pretty well on track there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3453.567s">[Bears]</a>: So I don't really have that many questions, you know, I will say, you know, as I've noted, speaking with the chief of staff, and the chief of staff has noted here at the podium when we've had specific discussions, there's the elections department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3466.433s">[Bears]</a>: Which needs might need an end of year transfer because of the cost of the recount, which was obviously on budgeted and unexpected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3474.915s">[Bears]</a>: Is there anything else that you guys want to talk about from the current fiscal year 24?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3480.503s">[Bears]</a>: Any budgets or anything that you'd like to inform us of beyond the presentation that you've made?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3584.945s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3585.345s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3585.605s">[Bears]</a>: And I mean, again, just looking at this, the pension, you know, pension obligation is a huge one that's been paid out because that's paid as a lump sum is my understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3620.543s">[Bears]</a>: For example, the bonds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3622.083s">[Bears]</a>: That's to come in later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3624.284s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3624.844s">[Bears]</a>: So, but yeah, I mean, everything in here, if you, I just, I took your sheet and I put some percentages next to it for my own edification and the vast majority of our departments are under 75%, which you'd expect them to be around 75% or less, unless they have one of those big one-time payments at a strange time of year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3642.267s">[Bears]</a>: It looks like we paid the trash contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3644.827s">[Bears]</a>: It looks like we paid the MWRA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3646.848s">[Bears]</a>: So we've been,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3648.476s">[Bears]</a>: doing our job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3651.281s">[Bears]</a>: I do have a couple questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3653.885s">[Bears]</a>: I will defer to my fellow councillors first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3656.709s">[Bears]</a>: I saw Councilor Callaghan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3658.011s">[Bears]</a>: Is there anybody else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3658.993s">[Bears]</a>: But you didn't have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3659.734s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3660.155s">[Bears]</a>: Any questions from anyone else so far?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3666.206s">[Bears]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3666.666s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3667.107s">[Bears]</a>: So, um, just on the budget, you know, something that we've talked about, and I know we'll look at it in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3673.232s">[Bears]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3673.973s">[Bears]</a>: But I really appreciate having this top line number the 188.59Million available for the general fund budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3681.96s">[Bears]</a>: which again is almost exactly $9 million more than the fiscal 24 available for the general fund budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3687.303s">[Bears]</a>: You've already shown us that just from health insurance, workers' compensation and the pension rate increases, that over a third of that $9 million is going just to the cost of benefits, fixed cost growth of the benefits for the city employees and school employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3704.605s">[Bears]</a>: Contractual obligations will eat up another large chunk of that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3709.85s">[Bears]</a>: I think something that will be helpful for us to know in the future, and I know we're getting them as we've been meeting so far in these preliminary meetings, but something I really appreciated hearing last week in our 1st budget meeting was that the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3724.484s">[Bears]</a>: departments were asked to make requests based on what, you know, not that their requests were not tailored.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3732.628s">[Bears]</a>: And I think that that is a really great thing to hear, because we can hear from our departments what they think their need is for staff and programming in the fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3742.554s">[Bears]</a>: I also understand that those requests came in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3745.575s">[Bears]</a>: The total of those requests was some amount above 188.59 million, which I think is unsurprising considering just how much need every single department in the city has for additional staff and additional resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3758.402s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, we all see it every day in a myriad ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3762.544s">[Bears]</a>: Maybe a little bit more if you're in this building all the time, but I think we also see it out in the community all the time where a lot of needs are unmet due to underfunding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3772.17s">[Bears]</a>: At some point, if<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3774.671s">[Bears]</a>: If it's easier, I know you guys are super busy and we're pulling all this together for this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3778.475s">[Bears]</a>: And I really appreciate the work that you put in to do that forward and having that number of knowing what that initial budget request was from each of the departments, I think will be really helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3789.144s">[Bears]</a>: I know that you guys in the department heads did a lot of work in the past few weeks to say, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3795.049s">[Bears]</a>: We know this is our revenue estimate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3797.25s">[Bears]</a>: We're going to go to the department and say, what do you think this year that we know you asked for this, but can you maybe not bring it in this year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3804.152s">[Bears]</a>: We're also trying to bring on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3805.293s">[Bears]</a>: 1 time funded positions from ARPA onto the general fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3809.114s">[Bears]</a>: So there's a lot of competing needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3812.415s">[Bears]</a>: But at some point, having that initial budget request and then seeing the hard work done by the administration and the department heads to kind of narrow that gap between what was requested and this revenue estimate would be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3824.623s">[Bears]</a>: And then I know just from some preliminary conversations that you're still working out the final amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3830.387s">[Bears]</a>: There's still some hundreds of thousands of dollars to bring the expense number down to equal the revenue number, which of course we have to do because we are required to have a balanced budget every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3843.355s">[Bears]</a>: Having those additional numbers will be helpful for us to understand, you know, what was requested that the departments need what we aren't able to do this year because of the fiscal restraint and restrictions put on us by what we're allowed to do as a community when it comes to raising revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3860.181s">[Bears]</a>: And then we can certainly work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3862.182s">[Bears]</a>: to explain and educate the public on why we couldn't do certain things this year, work together to understand what was prioritized and what wasn't prioritized based on trying to save staff positions and make sure our departments can continue to provide the service level that they currently provide to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3880.007s">[Bears]</a>: So look forward to doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3881.388s">[Bears]</a>: There's no form of emotion there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3885.169s">[Bears]</a>: We've been communicating about it, so we'll continue to communicate about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3890.649s">[Bears]</a>: Is there any other comments or comments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3895.51s">[Bears]</a>: Just a second, Councilor Scarpelli, I'll come to you in a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3900.931s">[Bears]</a>: I have Vice President Collins, Councilor Callahan, Councilor Scarpelli, and we'll talk about the legislative clerk and finance budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3907.053s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4155.975s">[Bears]</a>: Back of the napkin of insurance, pensions, and workers' comp is like between 20 and 25% of the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4160.197s">[Bears]</a>: It was last year's $41 million on a $180 million budget base, $179 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4175.094s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4251.635s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, just to clarify, the budgets we got last week and I believe the budgets we have tonight were those as requested by the department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4262.143s">[Bears]</a>: I do know that the administration has made some adjustments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4265.886s">[Bears]</a>: They're making adjustments from those initial requests to create the final budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4275.483s">[Bears]</a>: It's not a wish list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4277.204s">[Bears]</a>: It's what they would like to see this year, but not necessarily the dream budget per se.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4305.358s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4305.818s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4307.979s">[Bears]</a>: Any further questions or discussion on the presentation from our finance director?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4320.626s">[Bears]</a>: All right, let's go into the rest of this meeting, which is to discuss the three budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4328.413s">[Bears]</a>: We can start, since you're already up at the podium, with the finance department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4333.177s">[Bears]</a>: This was included in the packets online and in our print packets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4339.883s">[Bears]</a>: Basically, I was asking,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4342.469s">[Bears]</a>: Four questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4344.05s">[Bears]</a>: I know I don't think any of these departments have narrative for tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4349.071s">[Bears]</a>: If you want to come back and present your narrative at a later date, I know we'll be seeing a lot more of you over the next two months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4355.194s">[Bears]</a>: Oh, you haven't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4355.734s">[Bears]</a>: You haven't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4356.034s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4356.314s">[Bears]</a>: Even better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4358.295s">[Bears]</a>: But the questions I was asking of each department, since this is a preliminary budget meeting, were, first, is there anything you want to share about your department this year, what you've done over the past year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4369.859s">[Bears]</a>: What was your budget request?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4372.26s">[Bears]</a>: Are there any programs that you didn't request this year that you are looking to fund in the future, not necessarily in fiscal 25, but in future budgets?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4380.643s">[Bears]</a>: And then after the budget is presented at the end of May, let us know if you'd like to be invited back to talk more about your department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4388.866s">[Bears]</a>: So those are the questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4389.646s">[Bears]</a>: I can go over them as well, but feel free to go right ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4393.068s">[Bears]</a>: Director Dickinson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4407.145s">[Bears]</a>: And just before you start, I'm looking at finance procurement at a total of $859,901,965.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4414.696s">[Bears]</a>: that is an increase of $136.30 and $0.65 from the previous fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4421.32s">[Bears]</a>: And most of that is looking like if finance is absorbing the cost of the admin's program subscription.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4530.587s">[Bears]</a>: I know, you know, Courtney and Adam and we sat down with, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4534.932s">[Bears]</a>: to talk about the legislative budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4537.534s">[Bears]</a>: And I think it was one of the toughest conversations we had, because we asked for nothing to change at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4541.617s">[Bears]</a>: So seriously, Courtney was great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4607.007s">[Bears]</a>: When is FY23 coming out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4608.588s">[Bears]</a>: I think I'm the only person who's waiting for the debut date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4645.035s">[Bears]</a>: And that is the other post-employment benefits?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4647.777s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4648.177s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4860.575s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4861.155s">[Bears]</a>: Well, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4865.376s">[Bears]</a>: Any questions for the director about the finance department's proposed budget for fiscal 2025?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4871.297s">[Bears]</a>: I've got two questions for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4880.138s">[Bears]</a>: One, in terms of the RFPs, you said nine months, hopefully, to get some RFPs back on the financial software.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4931.483s">[Bears]</a>: Sandisfield.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4932.283s">[Bears]</a>: Sandisfield.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4934.923s">[Bears]</a>: Florida.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5048.868s">[Bears]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5049.128s">[Bears]</a>: Well, I know that's been a priority of this council, and I do hope that, you know, the solution that we come to enables everyone to do their job more efficiently and not have the reconciliation and the data cross between multiple systems that we're dealing with right now, because I know that would be a boon to everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5068.962s">[Bears]</a>: in terms of just making things easier, making things more timely, making it maybe easier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5074.046s">[Bears]</a>: I know, you know, basically I feel like we invite you here, we ask you to do a bunch of work every time you come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5079.069s">[Bears]</a>: So, you know, maybe this new system will make that a little bit less burdensome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5095.581s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5096.401s">[Bears]</a>: And it's noticed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5097.862s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5158.669s">[Bears]</a>: And I just had one last question, which is just on the clear outside of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5161.63s">[Bears]</a>: You know, I know we ran into some issues last year where some of the actuals uploaded in the clear of were not the right actuals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5168.012s">[Bears]</a>: And so, um, you know, just wanted to fly that again, because I think it is probably the place that most people look to see what's going on with the city's finances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5177.375s">[Bears]</a>: Um, and something I've also noticed some other communities and again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5182.397s">[Bears]</a>: Just going back to my asking you to do more work piece of this whole thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5185.158s">[Bears]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5188.604s">[Bears]</a>: Some communities will update the budget after approval to reflect any amendments or adjustments to the budget process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5195.374s">[Bears]</a>: I think we generally have been keeping up just the proposed version, or I'm not 100% sure about that, but that it's staying as the proposed budget versus the approved budget that people say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5206.089s">[Bears]</a>: Where can I find the approved budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5207.651s">[Bears]</a>: And it's, you know, well, this is pretty close, but it's not it's not 100%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5211.195s">[Bears]</a>: So those are just some things about the clear side of things that feedback we hear from residents that might be helpful to for just for residents to see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5221.747s">[Bears]</a>: And then, you know, we can put on, you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5223.829s">[Bears]</a>: Maybe you can add in this budget was approved June whatever by the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5228.19s">[Bears]</a>: These were the adjustments and this is the final approved amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5232.692s">[Bears]</a>: And then we can point people to say, that's the approved amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5238.613s">[Bears]</a>: I'm not sure how any of that works on the back end, but that's some of the feedback that we hear from residents who are trying to learn more about the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5263.018s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5263.818s">[Bears]</a>: And even just, I'm just in here right now, there's like a FY20 is presented strangely in the general fund summary and section three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5279.62s">[Bears]</a>: I think the great thing is that with the most of this shell built, now it's, you know, you can focus even more on the details of improving it, which I think is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5293.903s">[Bears]</a>: Any more questions for the finance director?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5299.064s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5301.164s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Bob.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5304.011s">[Bears]</a>: The other two budgets that we have here are the clerk's office and the legislative department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5310.656s">[Bears]</a>: For the clerk, we'll go to the clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5315.4s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5358.8s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5359.302s">[Bears]</a>: Any questions for the clerk on the clerk's budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5399.642s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5399.843s">[Bears]</a>: I think that's a huge change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5401.584s">[Bears]</a>: I'll also shout out the, uh, the marriage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5404.446s">[Bears]</a>: That's another change, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5405.486s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5405.827s">[Bears]</a>: Moving to online software, which is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5408.168s">[Bears]</a>: So, um, always good to hear and fingers crossed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5413.972s">[Bears]</a>: We'll be at full staff in the clerk's office in a few weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5416.474s">[Bears]</a>: That would be great for the first time in a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5428.987s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, and so that'll be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5433.925s">[Bears]</a>: All right, I see no questions for the clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5438.107s">[Bears]</a>: If there's anything else you want to share about plans for the future, you're welcome to, and we have you here at our mercy at all times, so we can ask you those questions whenever we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5487.336s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5488.817s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5490.517s">[Bears]</a>: The last budget we have is the, and I'll just read it out really quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5494.458s">[Bears]</a>: The total budget proposed for the clerk's office is $404,133.86.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5496.779s">[Bears]</a>: That is an increase of $19,977.86 from fiscal 24.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5497.979s">[Bears]</a>: And essentially all of that increases in the raises for the staff, the contractual raises for the staff in that department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5502.52s">[Bears]</a>: And it looks like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5517.27s">[Bears]</a>: you were able to find about $1,800 worth of some efficiencies on the ordinary expense side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5527.113s">[Bears]</a>: It's looking like some, where are we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5533.916s">[Bears]</a>: Oh yeah, subscriptions, subscriptions, publications, 2,500.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5541.038s">[Bears]</a>: I think you upped office equipment by about 1,000 there, so I can see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5548.155s">[Bears]</a>: Oh, sorry, office equipment, my apologies, yes, 500 and 200, yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5571.087s">[Bears]</a>: Last budget is the legislative budget, totaling 312,689.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5577.438s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to triple check, but I believe that that is identical to our proposed legislative budget for fiscal 24, which it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5587.0s">[Bears]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5587.32s">[Bears]</a>: And there was no change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5588.081s">[Bears]</a>: There's also no change from the prior year there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5591.862s">[Bears]</a>: We are getting into one of these conundrums where the longer you don't change something, the more you have to change it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5600.003s">[Bears]</a>: So I will note that for the future, although I am certainly not proposing anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5607.972s">[Bears]</a>: No change proposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5609.233s">[Bears]</a>: I am going to ask our finance department for one shift, if possible, if we could shift $1800 from line item 5240, which is our legislative repair and maintenance line item to 5202 for the videographer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5631.203s">[Bears]</a>: Our videographer has made a request to be paid closer to market rates and we would like to retain his services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5641.392s">[Bears]</a>: So that's our 1 request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5642.433s">[Bears]</a>: There's no shift within the node.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5644.154s">[Bears]</a>: No amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5644.675s">[Bears]</a>: The amount would stay the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5645.675s">[Bears]</a>: Uh, and given the actuals of legislative repair and maintenance, we believe that that is a. You know, we're very much under on that software.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5666.472s">[Bears]</a>: 5240 is our line item for civic clerk software, meeting code software, essentially our legislative softwares for codification and for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5680.131s">[Bears]</a>: The now running of our agendas and uploading of minutes and the agenda and meeting minutes portal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5687.473s">[Bears]</a>: So we haven't had a full year expenditure there yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5690.494s">[Bears]</a>: So we're waiting to see what that will look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5693.415s">[Bears]</a>: We used to fund the, I'm going to forget the name of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5697.757s">[Bears]</a>: IQM2 software package that the council used to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5704.301s">[Bears]</a>: It's similar to what Somerville used to use for their legislative maintenance, but that was where we were able to stream from room 207 before the pandemic, before we moved to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5714.907s">[Bears]</a>: President Morell and I were reviewing the budget and found that we were still paying for that software even though we were not using it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5720.27s">[Bears]</a>: And so we decided to stop doing that and to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5724.933s">[Bears]</a>: look at this new civic clerk software which has been actually was cheap quoted cheaper and has been fun serving more of the functions that we needed it to serve than the prior software package and the professional technical services other 5310 that is our funding for the zoning project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5745.233s">[Bears]</a>: So we split that with the Planning Development Sustainability Office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5749.735s">[Bears]</a>: That's our chunk of it for next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5751.756s">[Bears]</a>: We had the same amount this year, which was committed in both of the, this year and next year are both committed through the procurement process to that contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5765.423s">[Bears]</a>: Any further questions about the legislative budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5770.125s">[Bears]</a>: Again, there's no proposed change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5779.48s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, any further discussion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5782.562s">[Bears]</a>: I saw some general nods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5785.463s">[Bears]</a>: Are we cool with moving that money around in the legislative budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1814.537s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1817.059s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, it's on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1912.174s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2074.278s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2157.622s">[Bears]</a>: I invited them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2158.743s">[Bears]</a>: They did not respond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2168.31s">[Bears]</a>: They didn't even have a conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2179.239s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2374.377s">[Bears]</a>: Name an address for the record, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2471.067s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2471.407s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, just if I could give some context, we were working intensely to try to have an affordable housing nonprofit purchase this property instead of the for profit developer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2483.438s">[Bears]</a>: Sadly, the city does not have available funds in an affordable housing trust, which we just created this past year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2489.703s">[Bears]</a>: But you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2491.805s">[Bears]</a>: If there had been those funds available to make the difference between the offer from this for-profit developer who wants to kick everyone out versus the affordable housing nonprofit that wanted to work with everyone so they could stay, that's one of the efforts that we've put under.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2506.759s">[Bears]</a>: If the for-profit developer happened to be charged a transfer fee and the affordable housing developer was exempt from that, maybe that would have been the difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2514.803s">[Bears]</a>: And of course, this council has proposed several items related that have been discussed around addressing this issue of these large corporations buying buildings and apartments that people live in and call their home and kicking them out and turning it into a profit center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2531.051s">[Bears]</a>: So we will continue those efforts<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2534.272s">[Bears]</a>: because it's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2535.673s">[Bears]</a>: This isn't the first time we've seen it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2536.733s">[Bears]</a>: This isn't the first tenant association.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2538.214s">[Bears]</a>: I see a friend right here to talk about their experience with another tenant association in another building where this happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2545.196s">[Bears]</a>: It's not the first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2545.836s">[Bears]</a>: It won't be the last.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2547.037s">[Bears]</a>: And the people it hurts are our neighbors and our friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2549.538s">[Bears]</a>: So we're working on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2552.439s">[Bears]</a>: We need more resources, and we need more policy tools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2555.18s">[Bears]</a>: We need the state to give them to us, and we need more funds to make the city a real actor in this field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2561.722s">[Bears]</a>: So just wanted to put that out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2563.823s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2564.224s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2605.47s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2653.359s">[Bears]</a>: Any further comments from members of the public, either in person or on Zoom?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2879.933s">[Bears]</a>: Please take private conversations out in the hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2881.976s">[Bears]</a>: There's just kind of some whispers and conversations happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2884.96s">[Bears]</a>: If you're going to talk, please take it out in the hall and respect the people who are speaking and respect this public meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2889.506s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2890.967s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2895.571s">[Bears]</a>: So you just have to come a little closer to the microphone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2897.112s">[Bears]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2959.999s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2960.399s">[Bears]</a>: We're going to go to Eileen Lerner on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2968.183s">[Bears]</a>: Oh, I'm not a co-host.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2971.727s">[Bears]</a>: Somebody ask Eileen to unmute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2976.813s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=2977.093s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please, Eileen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3118.203s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Eileen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3125.425s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3375.745s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you Vice President Collins. Councilor Leming?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3534.835s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you Councilor Leming. Councilor Scarpelli?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3837.554s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3837.854s">[Bears]</a>: I just want to put out a couple of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3839.376s">[Bears]</a>: I think if we're talking about unity, we're talking about all agreeing, but we're also talking about misinformation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3843.922s">[Bears]</a>: The proposals that have been put forward when we talk about the someone in their home, they're on a fixed income, they're scared, they live in their home, they live in a single family or two family or three family that they're afraid of these proposals that we're proposing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3856.223s">[Bears]</a>: The next sentence out of everybody's mouth needs to be, all of these proposals exclude your house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3861.345s">[Bears]</a>: We're not going after one, two, and three families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3863.146s">[Bears]</a>: We're not going after owner occupied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3865.107s">[Bears]</a>: So when we talk about misinformation, that's the misinformation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3869.409s">[Bears]</a>: No, no point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3870.53s">[Bears]</a>: No, no, it's point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3872.571s">[Bears]</a>: When I'm done, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3874.051s">[Bears]</a>: So that's the facts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3875.152s">[Bears]</a>: Those are the facts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3875.792s">[Bears]</a>: So we're all talking about unity here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3877.473s">[Bears]</a>: We're talking about we agree that large corporations shouldn't come in and buy large multi-unit buildings and kick everybody out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3884.096s">[Bears]</a>: Great, so you support the proposals that we have on the table around the rent stabilization that says that and the transfer fee that says that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3890.199s">[Bears]</a>: Because that's what you all say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3892.92s">[Bears]</a>: That's what you all say, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3894.1s">[Bears]</a>: So that's the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3904.245s">[Bears]</a>: No, we've answered that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3905.865s">[Bears]</a>: We've answered that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3908.366s">[Bears]</a>: It's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3916.0s">[Bears]</a>: Just false information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3936.51s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3938.371s">[Bears]</a>: We have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3939.151s">[Bears]</a>: That's every email response to every email I've received.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3942.312s">[Bears]</a>: The demands are shifting, sir, because the demands were don't move it at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3946.653s">[Bears]</a>: You're moving too fast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3947.633s">[Bears]</a>: And now the demands are we're moving too slow?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3950.013s">[Bears]</a>: I can't count.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3950.753s">[Bears]</a>: I can't count which demands to meet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3953.514s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins, Councilor Leming, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4144.468s">[Bears]</a>: There are people who, when they don't pay their property taxes, they're foreclosed upon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4147.951s">[Bears]</a>: That is something that happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4168.354s">[Bears]</a>: There is an option for property tax deferments, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4177.236s">[Bears]</a>: It depends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4177.676s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, if they're not taking that policy out, and then they're not paying their taxes, all people are who do not pay their property taxes...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4185.058s">[Bears]</a>: What are you saying? It's a rampant problem?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4187.119s">[Bears]</a>: There's hundreds of people a month?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4193.04s">[Bears]</a>: It's not an eviction, it's a foreclosure, so we want to be factual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4217.611s">[Bears]</a>: And that happens, there are cases where that happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4221.435s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4224.818s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think anyone's saying that it's equivalent, but I don't think this is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4228.221s">[Bears]</a>: We're not gonna engage in dialogue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5013.945s">[Bears]</a>: It's been ruled illegal and it's something that this council is working very diligently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5022.99s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, and that's not a good law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5325.148s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Merritt, we've entertained a very long comment here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5328.152s">[Bears]</a>: Would you like to continue close up a wrapping up point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5350.1s">[Bears]</a>: I think we've been very clear about our position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5358.305s">[Bears]</a>: We're not going to have a debate about who comments what on Reddit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5363.688s">[Bears]</a>: Who's demonizing homeowners?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5364.569s">[Bears]</a>: You're inferring something that no one is saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5367.731s">[Bears]</a>: Really?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5367.871s">[Bears]</a>: You're inferring something that no one is saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5370.733s">[Bears]</a>: No, people are interpreting things because they're being misinformed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5377.847s">[Bears]</a>: We are considering, you just said it, the city does not generate enough revenue to fix what it needs to fix.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5382.148s">[Bears]</a>: We are considering generating revenue to fix what needs to be fixed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5430.904s">[Bears]</a>: I would suggest, I can't make a motion, would anyone like to make a motion to request that Charlesgate and the property owner negotiate with the tenants?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5442.191s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion of Councilor Leming to send a letter to Charlesgate and the property owner to request that they negotiate with the Tenants Association.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5451.317s">[Bears]</a>: Seconded by Councilor Callahan. Councilor Scarpelli?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5462.315s">[Bears]</a>: The request is from the tenants association.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5464.737s">[Bears]</a>: They would like to open negotiations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5466.459s">[Bears]</a>: So I think we can send a letter on behalf of the council that we would request that the property owner respond to their tenants and enter negotiations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5501.719s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you on the further amendment of Councilor Scarpelli to request that the mayor use her executive power to assist these tenants?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5955.846s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to ask Councilor Scarpelli, if you have an amendment to make this significantly more specific right now, I will certainly entertain it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5963.636s">[Bears]</a>: If not, I think we're running afoul of a couple Massachusetts general laws here and entertaining the discussion of the paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5969.524s">[Bears]</a>: So if you could outline what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5972.447s">[Bears]</a>: all options in supporting the budget means, as in the form of an amendment, and if you could outline, review the mayor's presentation in the form of an amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5981.329s">[Bears]</a>: After I hear the amendment, I'll decide whether or not to vote on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6044.143s">[Bears]</a>: is just on the second phrase, review the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6047.926s">[Bears]</a>: Is there any specific?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6103.047s">[Bears]</a>: Just, I want to define the amendment for Councilors, and then we can adopt the amended resolution, then we can consider it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6108.471s">[Bears]</a>: So the amendment is to amend this resolution to be a specific requesting that the council request that the mayor appropriate 5 to 7 million in free cash as an appropriation before free cash is certified to fund the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6122.394s">[Bears]</a>: And then also is it a motion to request the plan that outlined how she intends to spend the free cash reserves that she outlined on social media?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6178.44s">[Bears]</a>: Sounds like the free cash thing is re-amendable to having the discussion of the motion as amended, which is to request the mayor appropriate five to seven million in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6187.623s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6188.577s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6190.218s">[Bears]</a>: On the amendment, are there any objections to the amendment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6212.008s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion of Councilor Leming to table, is there a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6222.0s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Scarpelli...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6227.0s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion of Councilor Leming to table, is there a second? Is there a second? I need a second, and it's undebatable. Second by Councilor Collins. Mr. Clerk, please call the role on the motion to table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6269.105s">[Bears]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6270.186s">[Bears]</a>: Three in the affirmative, four in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6271.867s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6276.784s">[Bears]</a>: We don't have the answer when you free cash is certified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6279.025s">[Bears]</a>: Once the end of the fiscal year happens, we have to wait for it to be certified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6282.447s">[Bears]</a>: So it could be as three to nine months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6284.668s">[Bears]</a>: So it would be certified between September, October, as late as April or May of next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6309.574s">[Bears]</a>: If an appropriation of free cash is not made by June 30th, it cannot be made until free cash is then certified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6319.537s">[Bears]</a>: Up until certification, correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6323.698s">[Bears]</a>: Further discussion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6326.179s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6798.758s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6799.098s">[Bears]</a>: So we all agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6801.959s">[Bears]</a>: We all agree that the schools need five to seven more million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6805.94s">[Bears]</a>: So we talk about the facts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6807.34s">[Bears]</a>: Those are the facts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6807.98s">[Bears]</a>: We all agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6809.56s">[Bears]</a>: Now we appropriate them for free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6811.954s">[Bears]</a>: It's just delaying the inevitable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6814.136s">[Bears]</a>: We won't have any next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6815.537s">[Bears]</a>: We're just postponing the devastation until June 30th, 2020, doing exactly what we said we don't want to do, which is use one-time funds to, for whatever reason, have the thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6826.125s">[Bears]</a>: So we're having the same argument here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6827.746s">[Bears]</a>: We agree that the schools need $5 to $7 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6830.288s">[Bears]</a>: If we appropriate free cash, then we postpone the discussion for a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6834.171s">[Bears]</a>: If we actually raise the money, then we have it in perpetuity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6837.0s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins. Vice President Collins. Thank you. Vice President Collins. I recognize Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6848.0s">[Bears]</a>: I recognize Vice President Collins. Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6851.0s">[Bears]</a>: That's not true sir. You are literally... you're lying to the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6859.0s">[Bears]</a>: You don't. There's nothing. Order. Order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6874.0s">[Bears]</a>: I'm actually not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6876.495s">[Bears]</a>: Is there a motion to recess?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6880.037s">[Bears]</a>: Is there a motion to recess?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6882.079s">[Bears]</a>: Motion to recess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6882.78s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Leming, seconded by Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6884.261s">[Bears]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6895.962s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion of Councilor Collins to reconvene, seconded by?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6900.225s">[Bears]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6901.286s">[Bears]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6901.626s">[Bears]</a>: Opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6902.206s">[Bears]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6903.287s">[Bears]</a>: President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6907.25s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Leming, then Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6917.097s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Leming has invoked Rule 21 of the Medford City Council, which gives any city council the right to table any financial paper until the next regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6927.261s">[Bears]</a>: Paper is tabled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6930.424s">[Bears]</a>: Public participation. To participate out of zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6932.545s">[Bears]</a>: Please email ahurtubise...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6934.347s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6944.975s">[Bears]</a>: So this is a rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6946.837s">[Bears]</a>: Any financial paper placed before the council has to move on the table for until the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6953.254s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6962.681s">[Bears]</a>: Is the microphone on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6966.483s">[Bears]</a>: There you go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=7177.37s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=7300.554s">[Bears]</a>: And I just wanna say, Mr. Geehan, for myself and Vice President Collins as well,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=7307.881s">[Bears]</a>: We know the number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=7309.101s">[Bears]</a>: We're trying to find the short-term solution and the long-term sustainable solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=7313.382s">[Bears]</a>: We're trying to get that as quickly as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=7316.603s">[Bears]</a>: We're working with the person who gets to make that decision, and that that's what is taking time right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=7322.725s">[Bears]</a>: Our goal is to get it to as quickly as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=7325.005s">[Bears]</a>: My hopes are that the city, the public, the council, the teachers unit, and everybody will have a budget presented to them by the end of this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=7332.867s">[Bears]</a>: And then we'll know more about what that means in the short-term and the long-term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=7336.331s">[Bears]</a>: That's my understanding of the timeline right now, but we are working diligently to try to get these funds to stabilize the school funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=7366.694s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=7383.631s">[Bears]</a>: This is open public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=7432.488s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=7432.868s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=7520.406s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=7522.767s">[Bears]</a>: Gonna go to Mr. Castagnetti on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=7524.707s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Castagnetti, name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=7531.294s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Castagnetti, I'm gonna ask you to unmute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=7533.135s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=7537.937s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=7568.412s">[Bears]</a>: I don't have an answer to that question, but we can look into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=7579.736s">[Bears]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=7587.42s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion by members of the public, either in person or on Zoom?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=7592.506s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, is there a motion on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=7596.112s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion to adjourn by Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=7599.597s">[Bears]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=7600.819s">[Bears]</a>: Opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=7601.24s">[Bears]</a>: Motion passes and the meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2.085s">[Bears]</a>: City Council committee of the whole May 14 2024 Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=15.3s">[Bears]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=15.471s">[Bears]</a>: 7 present, none absent, this meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=19.074s">[Bears]</a>: There will be a meeting of the Medford City Council Committee of the Whole today at 6 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=23.256s">[Bears]</a>: in the Medford City Council Chamber, second floor, Medford City Hall, 85 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford MA and via Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=31.422s">[Bears]</a>: The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the annual budget process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=34.044s">[Bears]</a>: This is preliminary budget meeting number five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=36.886s">[Bears]</a>: The mayor has communicated that the following departments will be present, the library and the police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=42.729s">[Bears]</a>: So without further ado, we'll go in alphabetical order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=45.371s">[Bears]</a>: We'll take the library, we have Director Kerr, and this is a little bit different from previous years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=52.538s">[Bears]</a>: We are meeting with you before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=54.454s">[Bears]</a>: the budget is fully presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=56.355s">[Bears]</a>: This is, as I said, our fifth meeting, and we're excited to have you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=61.938s">[Bears]</a>: We do have copies of your budgets in front of us, and I've basically been asking four questions of the department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=70.984s">[Bears]</a>: One, what was your budget request?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=73.685s">[Bears]</a>: Two, are there any programs or other additions that you didn't request this year that you would be looking at in the future?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=81.91s">[Bears]</a>: and then asking you to share kind of the narrative of your budget for your department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=87.852s">[Bears]</a>: And at the end of the presentation, I will just note that if we see a big change from today to when the budget is presented to us, we may invite you back in June for another round.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=100.615s">[Bears]</a>: So very quickly, I will just read off here the library budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=107.827s">[Bears]</a>: For fiscal 24, the budget was $2,012,177.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=109.288s">[Bears]</a>: The budget this year is proposed at $2,245,111.90.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=121.397s">[Bears]</a>: And the main changes there are in our fixed cost growth category with 104,000 involved in staff increases and moving the office manager from 30 hours to 35 hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=137.231s">[Bears]</a>: 44,000 also in the staff to ensure that there's a pay increase for the hourly part time and a $90,000 increase in data processing because the cost of tech in our new library is much bigger.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=148.241s">[Bears]</a>: than our old library.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=150.182s">[Bears]</a>: And with that, I'll turn it over to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=239.821s">[Bears]</a>: Great, and feel free, if you wanna walk through this infographic or share your budget narrative, we'd love to hear what you've been doing this past year and what you're going to be up to next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=256.029s">[Bears]</a>: I have some extras here too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=397.192s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=397.552s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Director Kerr.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=399.235s">[Bears]</a>: Any questions from members of the Council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=402.538s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=495.487s">[Bears]</a>: Any further questions for our library director, Director Kerr?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=499.228s">[Bears]</a>: Council Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=687.915s">[Bears]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=688.635s">[Bears]</a>: Any other questions by members of the council for the library director?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=694.358s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, I have a few.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=697.2s">[Bears]</a>: One, I just want to confirm, there's no headcount increase in the budget as far as I could tell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=702.764s">[Bears]</a>: The only real major change is the 30 to 35 hours for the business manager?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=710.768s">[Bears]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=712.995s">[Bears]</a>: A follow-up on the part-time hourly salaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=715.196s">[Bears]</a>: You said that the last time that had gone up was 2019.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=717.638s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=719.799s">[Bears]</a>: And I just want to put it out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=721.46s">[Bears]</a>: The reason that they were making less than the minimum wage is that technically cities and towns are exempt from the minimum wage law in the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=728.123s">[Bears]</a>: So it was not illegally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=729.904s">[Bears]</a>: Sadly, the laws of the Commonwealth allow that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=732.986s">[Bears]</a>: So I'm glad to see that that's changing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=736.468s">[Bears]</a>: My last question is kind of a three-parter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=740.012s">[Bears]</a>: You mentioned around new staff and programs that you'd be looking for in the future, the program librarian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=745.137s">[Bears]</a>: Could you talk a little bit more about that, what that job does?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=747.479s">[Bears]</a>: Has that job existed in the past?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=749.441s">[Bears]</a>: And also, are there any other programs or staff that you would like to see maybe in future budgets?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=756.688s">[Bears]</a>: I know this is a tough year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=897.603s">[Bears]</a>: And my last question, you mentioned that some of this is bringing onto the budget items that have been funded temporarily by the Metro Public Library Foundation, part of the new building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=910.946s">[Bears]</a>: Is there anything else that needs to be brought over from that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=913.346s">[Bears]</a>: And also, is there anything that was being funded at the library by ARPA that is being brought onto the general fund?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=921.268s">[Bears]</a>: No ARPA, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=968.219s">[Bears]</a>: Great, that's great to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=986.337s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=987.878s">[Bears]</a>: Any further questions by members of the council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=992.021s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, is there anyone in the public who would like to comment on the library budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=996.724s">[Bears]</a>: Any members of the boards of trustees?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1002.632s">[Bears]</a>: Feeling good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1003.692s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1005.273s">[Bears]</a>: Well, thank you then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1006.073s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1006.994s">[Bears]</a>: We will certainly invite you back if anything changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1012.976s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1014.357s">[Bears]</a>: Next, we will go to Medford Police Department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1016.418s">[Bears]</a>: We have Chief Buckley and I will<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1021.824s">[Bears]</a>: say once again, kind of the framing here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1024.826s">[Bears]</a>: I'll quickly read the budget request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1027.008s">[Bears]</a>: If there's anything I missed, feel free to add on to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1031.171s">[Bears]</a>: Then we'd love to hear about anything that wasn't requested this year that you'll be requesting in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1037.116s">[Bears]</a>: Feel free to add that and share your narrative, and then we'll go to questions from the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1041.419s">[Bears]</a>: So very quickly, I will go here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1044.241s">[Bears]</a>: We have the Manford Police Department budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1046.863s">[Bears]</a>: We had for fiscal 24, $14,566,880 budgeted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1049.445s">[Bears]</a>: For fiscal 25, the proposed budget is $14,785,259.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1050.827s">[Bears]</a>: And we had FY 24 budgeted total headcount 122, FY 25 total headcount 128.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1068.943s">[Bears]</a>: And then the change sheet indicates that the fixed cost growth is $317,217 in full-time salaries, and then about $150,000, maybe $140,000 in a number of other items, court time, education incentive, academy tuition, professional services, and laundry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1088.237s">[Bears]</a>: And then in terms of new expenses, there's some new expenses for data processing and for telephone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1093.621s">[Bears]</a>: And with that, I will turn it over to you, Chief Buckley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1190.81s">[Bears]</a>: If you want to share a little bit about what you've done, Fiscal 24, any plans or new things you'd like to do in Fiscal 25?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1591.019s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Chief Buckley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1592.599s">[Bears]</a>: Any questions from members of the council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1595.558s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1855.572s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1856.453s">[Bears]</a>: I'll go to Councilor  Tseng, Councilor Callaghan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1858.254s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor  Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2226.975s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2227.956s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2228.637s">[Bears]</a>: Any further questions from members of the Council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2232.44s">[Bears]</a>: Council Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2251.886s">[Bears]</a>: I have a few.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2252.987s">[Bears]</a>: So just a couple quickly is the accreditation through the post commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2258.192s">[Bears]</a>: Is that or is it a private accreditation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2293.752s">[Bears]</a>: Kind of along the same lines, the education incentives a pretty big chunk of your budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2298.396s">[Bears]</a>: Is that mostly related to officer certification and like on duty related education?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2303.06s">[Bears]</a>: Or is it kind of wide open?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2380.13s">[Bears]</a>: And just to clarify, so it's if they have the degree, there's an incentive pay, not that we're paying, or is it that we're paying for them to get the degree?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2394.941s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2395.301s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2397.603s">[Bears]</a>: The recovery coach for fiscal 25, is that staying with the health department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2401.306s">[Bears]</a>: Or I know that was kind of a grant funded and maybe in a tough spot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2413.479s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2420.505s">[Bears]</a>: I've got two more quick questions and I have a question on the head counts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2424.288s">[Bears]</a>: The professional services, legal fees increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2426.81s">[Bears]</a>: Is that, is that going, I'm just wondering why it's outside of the law department budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2452.204s">[Bears]</a>: Okay, so you're getting sued over firearms licenses, basically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2455.085s">[Bears]</a>: Like weekly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2455.965s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2456.945s">[Bears]</a>: Maybe not that much, but yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2459.866s">[Bears]</a>: And then what is SonicWall?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2466.434s">[Bears]</a>: Cool, yeah, I just didn't, it's got a fun name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2470.857s">[Bears]</a>: All right, my last question is on the headcount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2474.219s">[Bears]</a>: It's kind of a multi-parter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2475.86s">[Bears]</a>: I think Councilor is saying, you answered the question, there's nothing that's ARPA funded that's coming onto the general fund in this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2483.785s">[Bears]</a>: We're going from 102 to 107 on patrol and then one dispatcher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2489.728s">[Bears]</a>: And I guess I'm wondering kind of two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2493.703s">[Bears]</a>: It's described as fixed cost growth, but to me it's new positions from fiscal 24.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2497.767s">[Bears]</a>: And I'm wondering if you could just go a little bit more into why that's being considered a not a new position, but a fixed cost change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2552.627s">[Bears]</a>: That's the patrol.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2574.324s">[Bears]</a>: And so I misread.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2575.584s">[Bears]</a>: It's 102 to 107 across the board, not patrol.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2577.845s">[Bears]</a>: My apologies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2590.468s">[Bears]</a>: And the main reason I ask it is it is a difficult year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2593.969s">[Bears]</a>: Um, and it sounds like we're just trying to get half of halfway back to where we wanted, where we were a few fiscal years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2599.411s">[Bears]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2601.499s">[Bears]</a>: I just want to raise that point because I think it's important for people to understand what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2606.303s">[Bears]</a>: And in the light of proposals in other departments, I mean, we're talking about net 20, maybe net 40 loss in the school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2614.989s">[Bears]</a>: We just need to have all the information out there to explain why things are happening the way that they're happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2641.166s">[Bears]</a>: I see the effort completely in the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2643.227s">[Bears]</a>: Some people are going to point to the headcount, you know, and I just think it's important to have a holistic conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2649.45s">[Bears]</a>: My last two questions, you said you're at, so we're budgeted for 102 and we're at 97 right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2656.293s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2656.954s">[Bears]</a>: And so you're hoping to fill 10 vacancies hopefully if this budget goes through as is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2672.988s">[Bears]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2673.548s">[Bears]</a>: And then, I think that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2676.729s">[Bears]</a>: Do you expect any more retirements or vacancies this year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2688.53s">[Bears]</a>: And are you having difficulties with the applications getting enough folks in to civil service and to training?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2750.196s">[Bears]</a>: Good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2750.616s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2751.257s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2751.617s">[Bears]</a>: I know that was a bunch of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2753.059s">[Bears]</a>: It's a big crowd out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2756.081s">[Bears]</a>: It's orchestra.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2757.483s">[Bears]</a>: The orchestra is coming to perform their statewide winning award winning performance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2762.768s">[Bears]</a>: So want to get them in here as soon as we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2765.911s">[Bears]</a>: Is there anything else you want to say before I open it up to the public very quickly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2794.664s">[Bears]</a>: Awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2828.764s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2835.047s">[Bears]</a>: I can go very quickly through that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2837.088s">[Bears]</a>: Traffic supervisors, we're going from 357, 650 to 361, 525.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2842.952s">[Bears]</a>: My understanding is that's fixed costs under the union contract, 2%?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2845.994s">[Bears]</a>: Correct, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2847.674s">[Bears]</a>: All right, any questions on traffic supervisors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2851.502s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, on the Traffic Commission, we're going from 27,800 to 30,500.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2855.363s">[Bears]</a>: It looks like that's a 2,700 increase in materials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2860.144s">[Bears]</a>: Do you want to speak to that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2923.337s">[Bears]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2924.217s">[Bears]</a>: Any questions on the Traffic Commission, Vice President Collins?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2934.84s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2935.42s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2936.2s">[Bears]</a>: Wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2937.861s">[Bears]</a>: With that, I'll open up to members of the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2939.541s">[Bears]</a>: Is there anyone here who would like to speak on the Police Budget or Traffic Commission or Traffic Supervisors either in person or on Zoom?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2947.023s">[Bears]</a>: You can come to the podium or raise your hand on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2955.572s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, thank you, Chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2958.339s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Lieutenant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2960.705s">[Bears]</a>: Is there a motion on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2964.983s">[Bears]</a>: Motion to adjourn by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2968.444s">[Bears]</a>: Before we call, we won't call the roll, we'll just do a voice vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2972.605s">[Bears]</a>: We're gonna have an orchestra performance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2975.185s">[Bears]</a>: We have some certificates to hand out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2978.846s">[Bears]</a>: So stick around, we're gonna move to a different Zoom meeting, but we may not get to some of our business for a little while until we get that done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2987.507s">[Bears]</a>: So I think it's a nice day, a good meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2990.889s">[Bears]</a>: And with that, on the motion of Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3926.456s">[Bears]</a>: I think we've really opened a new era in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3929.859s">[Bears]</a>: an open process where we can have those questions and have the council be a part, a collaborative part of the budget process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3936.741s">[Bears]</a>: So I just want to thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3937.862s">[Bears]</a>: It's been a great few months, some long meetings, but a great few months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6998.301s">[Bears]</a>: Almost done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6999.802s">[Bears]</a>: We have two more hands raised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7001.604s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to councilor Scarpelli and then vice president Collins. Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7466.018s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7469.48s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7475.903s">[Bears]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7490.424s">[Bears]</a>: Please share your comments to the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7492.546s">[Bears]</a>: I'm gonna go to Vice President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7735.161s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7737.304s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to go to Councilor Leming and then I do have one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7833.075s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7940.236s">[Bears]</a>: One of the other benefits of streaming on YouTube is it's a lot easier to fast forward through the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7946.177s">[Bears]</a>: So if anyone wants to watch it later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7950.538s">[Bears]</a>: My one question, and I hate to derail a wonderful dialogue and narrative, it's actually about the law department budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7957.9s">[Bears]</a>: And I just wanted to say, A, that I'm thankful to see the increase in the salary for the city solicitor position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7963.996s">[Bears]</a>: I'm hopeful that with that competitive number, we'll finally be able to bring someone on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7967.697s">[Bears]</a>: I know that position has been vacant for a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7969.638s">[Bears]</a>: The only other thing, it's kind of a question, feel free to respond to my comment, and it'll be the only one I make from the chair on this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7976.34s">[Bears]</a>: Two years ago, we did agree to include an assistant city solicitor position in the budget that has been removed for this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7982.202s">[Bears]</a>: We had a discussion with the chief of staff about it, and I understand the position, the difficulties, that money being essentially right now used to help<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7990.084s">[Bears]</a>: to address the fiscal crisis that we're in in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7992.445s">[Bears]</a>: So I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7993.726s">[Bears]</a>: But regardless of our philosophical, potential philosophical difference on that, I do want to say that that is important to me, that the council has voiced that to be an important position and I am hopeful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8005.832s">[Bears]</a>: if this package does move forward, that we can have further discussions, hopefully with a city solicitor hired at this new rate about potentially restoring that position in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8014.695s">[Bears]</a>: So I just wanted to put that on record as that is something that we have talked about two budgets ago and is important and this council has raised as an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8029.161s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8029.721s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8030.321s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8030.641s">[Bears]</a>: Any further questions from members of the council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8033.581s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, we're going to go into public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8035.362s">[Bears]</a>: People who would like to speak for public comment may line up at the podium here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8039.064s">[Bears]</a>: They may raise their hand on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8041.125s">[Bears]</a>: The mad rush begins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8043.386s">[Bears]</a>: And we are going to be following the public comment rules laid out by the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8048.809s">[Bears]</a>: We will have three minutes for the first two hours of public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8052.571s">[Bears]</a>: After two hours, we will go for one further minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8058.31s">[Bears]</a>: Sure, if they need to get home, that's all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8060.551s">[Bears]</a>: If we have a student here, someone who needs to get home, it is a school night, so we'll make a school night exception.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8068.256s">[Bears]</a>: But it'll be three minutes for each speaker for the first two hours, followed by one more minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8076.78s">[Bears]</a>: After two hours, we'll go to one minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8078.321s">[Bears]</a>: So please keep your comments as brief as you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8080.441s">[Bears]</a>: I will put a timer up on the board, but first we'll recognize our young person here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8087.384s">[Bears]</a>: Welcome, thank you for being before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8089.445s">[Bears]</a>: If you could just say your name and then give your comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8092.105s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you so much for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8132.274s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you Simon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8144.508s">[Bears]</a>: All right, we'll go to the podium, name and address for the record, please, and then I will alternate with Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8265.547s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8269.548s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to go to Zoom and then I'll come back to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8272.51s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to recognize Chris Bennett on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8274.632s">[Bears]</a>: Chris, you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8275.973s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8384.741s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8385.742s">[Bears]</a>: I'll just say two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8386.944s">[Bears]</a>: There's, I believe about 12,000 properties, residential properties in the city that are owner occupied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8395.856s">[Bears]</a>: And the city council has not received a pay increase since 2016.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8399.42s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8502.849s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8506.192s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to go to Jess H on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8510.555s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8530.899s">[Bears]</a>: The tax exemptions that the state allows the city to charge and the override are separate issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8536.362s">[Bears]</a>: The city does have the maximum tax exemption for seniors, veterans, and the blind that is allowed by state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8552.71s">[Bears]</a>: It will apply the same way that the property tax applies to everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8566.155s">[Bears]</a>: That's not legally allowed under state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8574.159s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8629.558s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8670.769s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Jess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8942.863s">[Bears]</a>: I just also want to note the school committee did not vote themselves to raise this council considered an adjustment of their compensation after 24 years of no increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8950.968s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8982.708s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Kanye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8983.789s">[Bears]</a>: In addition to the exemptions, there's the deferral program, and there's also a senior tax work off program where some seniors come to City Hall and help out and have some of their taxes reduced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8994.494s">[Bears]</a>: Go to the podium, name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9219.685s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9220.165s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to go to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9224.127s">[Bears]</a>: Bob Jones, Menford Fire Union Local 1032.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9228.409s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9229.749s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9261.451s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Jones, we don't have public minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9263.612s">[Bears]</a>: They were not public meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9279.82s">[Bears]</a>: The press releases issued by the financial task force contain a summary of the decisions that we made and the discussions that we had in those meetings, and they are available to the public on the city website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9351.265s">[Bears]</a>: That is in the law department budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9360.608s">[Bears]</a>: It has the amount that he has budgeted for those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9362.949s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9365.23s">[Bears]</a>: You can look available for prior years as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9393.919s">[Bears]</a>: I'll give you 30 more seconds, but just to answer the question, if you go on the city website and you go under mayor's office, the menu, there's a city budget page, and the city budget is there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9403.045s">[Bears]</a>: And one thing we did request this year was to have an additional year of the actuals included, and the administration said that they did include that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9409.709s">[Bears]</a>: There's a budget book available on the city website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9412.791s">[Bears]</a>: And I'll give you an extra 30 seconds to answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9445.945s">[Bears]</a>: My understanding is that the owner's project manager for the fire station is finalizing the design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9450.646s">[Bears]</a>: The debt exclusion vote authorizes the city to bond an amount up to the amount necessary, um, determined by the design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9460.008s">[Bears]</a>: So, um, it is still being finalized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9462.868s">[Bears]</a>: Uh, the financial task force estimated the highest amount of the bond would be about $30 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9467.569s">[Bears]</a>: Um, but I do know that there's still design considerations ongoing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9501.834s">[Bears]</a>: Those were part of the press release.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9503.694s">[Bears]</a>: The total of all three is an estimate of $446 a year or about $42 per month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9514.437s">[Bears]</a>: For the average single family home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9516.557s">[Bears]</a>: Single family home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9521.998s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9522.958s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9523.898s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9525.239s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9607.455s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Gannon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9609.356s">[Bears]</a>: I can't speak for the school committee,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9611.605s">[Bears]</a>: I do see some school committee members here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9613.991s">[Bears]</a>: I do know that the school committee has had to wait to schedule their budget meeting until we have an allocation before us and approved it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9620.447s">[Bears]</a>: And my understanding of the 77.75 million, it's not the 79.4 requested by the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9629.132s">[Bears]</a>: But my understanding is that the intent is that if the overrides were to pass, then there could be supplemental appropriation recommended by the school committee to the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9640.198s">[Bears]</a>: And the override questions also would become active this fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9644.48s">[Bears]</a>: So essentially,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9648.007s">[Bears]</a>: there's money for the first two quarters of the year and there potentially will be more money after that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9652.71s">[Bears]</a>: That's just my understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9653.751s">[Bears]</a>: I'm again, not on the school committee, but just to allay some of those fears beyond that, I do not know when the school committee is going to schedule their meeting or release a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9662.437s">[Bears]</a>: But I do know that they had to wait for us to approve an allocation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9691.994s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9697.355s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to go to Ken on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9701.117s">[Bears]</a>: Ken, I'm gonna unmute you, name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10669.019s">[Bears]</a>: Sir, I do not think you're benefiting your position by disrupting a public meeting and screaming at the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10675.386s">[Bears]</a>: I do not think you convince anyone with your outburst.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10730.58s">[Bears]</a>: Sam, if we could, there's just some noise and the kind of a tantrum in the rotunda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=12414.668s">[Bears]</a>: I can say a couple things on development and on Tufts University.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=12420.785s">[Bears]</a>: We don't have the authority to stop Tufts University in many ways from doing what they do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=12425.109s">[Bears]</a>: They have exemptions that they, quite frankly, bought and paid for under the state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=12433.356s">[Bears]</a>: Which one, sorry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=12437.78s">[Bears]</a>: The church, the church purchased that building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=12442.904s">[Bears]</a>: That's Vida Real is a church, so they purchased the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=12457.611s">[Bears]</a>: We are working very hard on commercial and economic development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=12466.495s">[Bears]</a>: It is for profit, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=12470.037s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=12470.477s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to have to move us on to another speaker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=12862.398s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=12863.519s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=12930.865s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=12931.205s">[Bears]</a>: And I just want to respond quickly to that comment and I appreciate bringing it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=12937.096s">[Bears]</a>: Part of this is about adding staff and DPW to address kind of the problem Anna was talking about earlier, trying to keep those B, C, and D roads from getting to an F grade where it costs that huge risk amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=12950.128s">[Bears]</a>: And we are also working on, the administration is working on a comprehensive assessment on the water sewer system to assess the full cost of what it would take to bring us to a state of good repair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=12960.297s">[Bears]</a>: And we do have some reports on roads and sidewalks as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=12963.7s">[Bears]</a>: where we will have to do more work on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=12965.061s">[Bears]</a>: But yeah, the infrastructure is huge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=12966.542s">[Bears]</a>: And one of the other huge outstanding pieces is the fire headquarters being probably one of the two biggest facilities capital needs on the infrastructure side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=12975.247s">[Bears]</a>: So it is definitely, this whole package is probably 70% schools, 30% infrastructure, more work to come on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=12983.712s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you for the comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=12985.873s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=12986.834s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=12987.794s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13012.505s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13012.885s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13016.368s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13135.143s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13135.644s">[Bears]</a>: And I will say, I just want to thank you for the comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13140.587s">[Bears]</a>: And one thing this council has been doing is at the very least asking our state government to give cities and towns more authority or to take a bigger role when they<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13149.133s">[Bears]</a>: with the power that they have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13152.495s">[Bears]</a>: And we have three on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13154.276s">[Bears]</a>: I'm gonna go to Mr. Castagnetti on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13158.079s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13159.399s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13226.633s">[Bears]</a>: Any member of the committee can request a division of the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13244.877s">[Bears]</a>: The paper for the general fund was about $189 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13259.098s">[Bears]</a>: The 190 includes more than just the property tax levy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13273.37s">[Bears]</a>: There was 2.8 million this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13274.811s">[Bears]</a>: It was the highest amount in the last 20 fiscal years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13327.356s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13327.876s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to go to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13330.097s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13431.144s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13431.604s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to go to Tony Tanks on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13437.928s">[Bears]</a>: Tony, name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13439.669s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13618.988s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13619.408s">[Bears]</a>: I have, uh, two people who have spoken already on zoom, and I also have two public comments to read.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13628.773s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to read the public comments now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13631.174s">[Bears]</a>: Um, Jessica Taddeo, 50 fells.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13634.376s">[Bears]</a>: You have mentored.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13634.996s">[Bears]</a>: I may to the members of the city council, the mayor and the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13637.477s">[Bears]</a>: I write to you today to express my support for proposition two and a half override and use of a free cash reserves to fund our schools, fix our infrastructure and provide mentor for the permanent support structure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13646.782s">[Bears]</a>: I do not believe it as a generalization to claim,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13648.976s">[Bears]</a>: and a majority of residents were shocked and appalled to see potential outline cuts to various programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13653.622s">[Bears]</a>: And as one of those residents, I believe wholeheartedly that this is the only solution to these problems we face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13658.128s">[Bears]</a>: I ask that you use the city's free cash as a short-term solution so a budget that funds all necessary programs can be passed by this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13663.996s">[Bears]</a>: The free cash is meant for emergencies and this is without a doubt an emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13667.199s">[Bears]</a>: I believe the use of these reserves are a necessary step prior to a vote taken by the public regarding a debt exclusion and override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13672.385s">[Bears]</a>: I've spent a lot of time talking to voters over the last four months, and many of them are quick to voice their concerns over funding for the schools and the state of our infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13679.592s">[Bears]</a>: These are the two biggest issues for residents in my eyes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13681.675s">[Bears]</a>: This seems like a perfect fix.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13683.216s">[Bears]</a>: I believe that with a coordinated effort, strong message, and open dialogue,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13686.199s">[Bears]</a>: Many residents would be in support of any measure taken that promises a strong school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13690.261s">[Bears]</a>: I am a product of Medford Public Schools, and I am endlessly grateful for the education and support I received.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13695.884s">[Bears]</a>: It is important to me that future generations of students receive the same support, programs, and opportunities my classmates and I enjoyed, specifically fostering a performing arts program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13704.148s">[Bears]</a>: Research shows that those involved in art, performance, music, and dance are smarter, better analytical thinkers, and bring a necessary perspective to more, quote, conventional disciplines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13713.482s">[Bears]</a>: Additionally, these spaces are refuge for many children seeking communities and way to express themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13718.168s">[Bears]</a>: The proposed cuts are daunting and I believe that 7.5 million as a minimum for an override would set up younger generations for a future of success, knowledge and creativity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13726.431s">[Bears]</a>: Opponents of this will claim that supporters are squeezing money from working families, unfairly taxing residents, and that the city will not use the money responsibly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13733.134s">[Bears]</a>: These opponents are the same people with the loudest voices expressing concerns about our schools, roads, potholes, and lack of services for residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13739.776s">[Bears]</a>: To opponents, I say, no matter your politics or views on the city finances, a strong foundation for future generations is paramount to any political or financial concerns in the present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13749.06s">[Bears]</a>: To opponents, I say these resolutions are proof that your elected officials are listening and helping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13752.862s">[Bears]</a>: I implore you to consider a budget that allows our schools to flourish for decades to come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13756.516s">[Bears]</a>: The time is now to fix this longstanding issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13758.857s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13759.257s">[Bears]</a>: And I have from Ken Kraus, 50 Mystic Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13763.358s">[Bears]</a>: Dear Medford City Council members, I am part of a demographic that might be expected to oppose tax overrides such as the ones being proposed for the November ballot, a senior citizen with no children or grandchildren in the Metro Public Schools on a fixed income and with new and increasing medical bills and other expenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13777.282s">[Bears]</a>: But in fact, I am 100% in favor of this measure being approved to appear on the November ballot, where I'll be eager to vote for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13783.163s">[Bears]</a>: Simply put, the city of Medford, the cost of business continues to go up,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13786.5s">[Bears]</a>: just like my plumber does when costs increase, it is reasonable to ask the paying customer to pay more for services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13791.381s">[Bears]</a>: It has never been more clear than during the current budget process, especially regarding the schools, that we don't have enough revenue to cover the basic costs of running a high-functioning city, let alone major capital improvements such as a new fire headquarters or high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13803.124s">[Bears]</a>: It is appropriate for the city to examine how to increase revenue from each leg<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13806.585s">[Bears]</a>: of the multi-leg stool of sources, including property taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13809.868s">[Bears]</a>: True, in my 24 years as a Medford homeowner, our taxes have been low compared to neighboring communities, one of the many things that make Medford such an appealing place to live.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13818.355s">[Bears]</a>: Sure, everyone wants their taxes to be as low as possible, but a small increase in this segment by way of an override is a reasonable proposition and a good investment in helping the city bring its annual budget closer to where it needs to be to cover essential needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13830.205s">[Bears]</a>: residents should know that the city is working hard to increase revenue from the other legs of that stool as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13834.95s">[Bears]</a>: After a major decline in life sciences, sidelined several promising large projects, major commercial development projects have reemerged, including a $20 million makeover of former Century Bank building at 400 Mystic Avenue and large residential projects at 970 Felsway and 280 Mystic Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13850.726s">[Bears]</a>: These and others to follow will be providing substantial commercial tax and other revenue to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13855.907s">[Bears]</a>: The Mass Gaming Commission recently approved the city's current request of $1.04 million from its Community Mitigation Fund for 10 projects across the city, including $300,000 for improvements to Chevalier Theatre, the primary economic engine for Medford Square that has created tens of thousands of dollars in meal and hotel tax revenue for the city alone, not to mention jobs and steady purchases from a multitude of other Medford businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13876.618s">[Bears]</a>: Those are just two examples I cite in response to people say the city is overburdening the residential taxpayer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13881.039s">[Bears]</a>: Finally, I noted above, we're talking about the city covering essential needs such as robust education, that doesn't short-range departments such as the arts, and not that many things in the city could truly use help to make it thrive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13891.403s">[Bears]</a>: Our city's departments are hardly bloated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13892.923s">[Bears]</a>: For example, Somerville, albeit a bit larger city, has 10 staff members for its arts council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13897.905s">[Bears]</a>: The Medford Arts Council has zero staff members, and the council's volunteer members do not even receive a stipend for serving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13903.567s">[Bears]</a>: just think how much stronger this important community asset both in terms of quality of life and its significant economic benefit to the city could be with just one staff member rather than the city relying almost completely on volunteers such as those with cache west medford open studios medford porch fest etc to put on more than 1 000 events you'd see 1 000 events a year almost totally on their own<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13923.274s">[Bears]</a>: Last, the city must be able to offer competitive wages in order to attract top quality employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13927.556s">[Bears]</a>: Many city hiring managers will tell you about strong candidates who are lost to other municipalities, not to mention the private sector due to higher salary offers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13934.619s">[Bears]</a>: The city needs more revenue to provide residents with the best possible staff and best possible services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13939.101s">[Bears]</a>: I strongly urge the city council to vote in favor of putting three proposed tax overrides on the November ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13944.523s">[Bears]</a>: And thank you for all your hard work in bringing forward these vitally important measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13947.565s">[Bears]</a>: Sincerely, Ken Kraus, 50 Mystic Street, Medford, Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13951.984s">[Bears]</a>: Pursuant to the new rule, I'm gonna go for one minute to Jess H, and then one minute to Sharon Deeso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13959.51s">[Bears]</a>: Jess H, you have one minute, name and address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13961.992s">[Bears]</a>: Well, you've already given your name and address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13963.373s">[Bears]</a>: Just confirm that you're Jess Healy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13975.883s">[Bears]</a>: Sorry, can you restate the question one more time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13986.803s">[Bears]</a>: There is a proposal before the Community Development Board and the Zoning Board of Appeals for a substance use clinic on Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13996.27s">[Bears]</a>: The Zoning Board of Appeals is the final decision maker on that proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14005.377s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, and they have a Community Development Board<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14008.504s">[Bears]</a>: in a zoning board meeting, I believe on June 25th and June 26th to consider that application for a special permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14019.089s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14020.27s">[Bears]</a>: I'll go to Sharon Diaso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14021.57s">[Bears]</a>: Sharon, you're going to have one minute if you could just confirm that you are Sharon, and then I'll give you one minute for a special permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14033.376s">[Bears]</a>: Sharon, you're going to have one minute if you could just confirm<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14036.786s">[Bears]</a>: That you are sharing and then I'll give you one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14045.872s">[Bears]</a>: Sharon, if you could meet your TV and then I'll unmute you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14067.383s">[Bears]</a>: You have one minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14160.424s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, as Councilor Collins has moved to divide the question, seconded by Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14164.067s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll to divide the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14166.469s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14188.231s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, 70 affirmative, none negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14189.755s">[Bears]</a>: The question is divided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14191.159s">[Bears]</a>: I did want to note before we move through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14193.604s">[Bears]</a>: The mayor did submit slightly amended versions of these papers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14198.226s">[Bears]</a>: Those were the versions that I read prior to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14202.047s">[Bears]</a>: I did have a suggestion if a motion could be made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14205.868s">[Bears]</a>: I believe there is a copy edit error in 24414 and 24415.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14208.429s">[Bears]</a>: If we could strike the words FY 2025 before general operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14211.91s">[Bears]</a>: If folks need a second to review that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14224.67s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14258.414s">[Bears]</a>: It's in the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14261.457s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, it would just be before the words general operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14755.281s">[Bears]</a>: 24-412.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14758.092s">[Bears]</a>: resolution to recognize and discuss the Stop the Sigma campaign in relation to our neighbors with substance use disorder, whereas substance use disorder is a recognized disease by the medical community, and whereas in 2023,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14768.467s">[Bears]</a>: Medford was home to 403 individuals with active prescriptions for buprenorphine and medications as a treatment for opioid recovery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14775.112s">[Bears]</a>: And whereas buprenorphine and methadone are lifesaving medications to treat substance use disorder and are effective at treating opioid dependence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14780.596s">[Bears]</a>: And whereas between July, 2022 and June, 2023, Medford was home to 22 individuals who died for reasons related to substance use disorder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14787.662s">[Bears]</a>: And whereas in 2018, 16% of individuals with a substance use disorder did not seek treatment because they were worried it would have a negative impact on their employment and approximately 15%<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14798.069s">[Bears]</a>: 15% felt it would impact their community's view of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14800.53s">[Bears]</a>: And whereas a disease is not a moral failing now, therefore be it hereby resolved that the Medford City Council recognize that all Medford residents are deserving of care and respect, regardless of their medical disability or disability status, be it further resolved that when we speak of the services we can offer our residents, we do so while offering the utmost dignity to all people at all times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14817.218s">[Bears]</a>: Council Luzardo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15083.84s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15085.742s">[Bears]</a>: I just want to thank my fellow Councilor for putting this item on the agenda, bringing up some very important issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15092.11s">[Bears]</a>: And I think we all know how much the opioid crisis has impacted our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15098.017s">[Bears]</a>: Such a serious, serious issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15100.846s">[Bears]</a>: And, you know, whether it's meant for overcoming addiction or our prevention and outreach office or just the sheer amount of work that so many people in this community have done to do harm reduction and also try to just save lives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15116.733s">[Bears]</a>: I think it's important that we acknowledge that, you know, yes, it's a difficult issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15122.755s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, it's tough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15124.796s">[Bears]</a>: But that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15126.052s">[Bears]</a>: There are people and families in our community who have been so deeply affected by substance use disorders and people in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15134.816s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, I have been to funerals of people I went to school with in Medford, at Medford High School, who maybe if our society thought about these a little bit differently or spoke about these issues a little bit differently,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15152.512s">[Bears]</a>: would have gotten the help that they needed and they'd be alive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15155.935s">[Bears]</a>: So for every statement that is made that I can understand fear and concern, but I think that humanizing these human beings in our community and these human beings in our, whether they're just in Medford or they're around the region, it's important for us to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15177.011s">[Bears]</a>: And I see that as the intent of this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15178.912s">[Bears]</a>: So I thank you for putting it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15312.694s">[Bears]</a>: I just wanted to note one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16786.677s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, just want to acknowledge this is a month, a heritage month that is acknowledged and created by the federal government under presidents of all parties, congresses of all parties, and has been around since the early 2000s.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16801.343s">[Bears]</a>: So it is just another great thing to celebrate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=464.389s">[Bears]</a>: Resolution celebrating Tom Lincoln's service as Brooks Estate President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=468.173s">[Bears]</a>: Whereas Tom Lincoln has served as President of the Medford Brooks Estate Land Trust and Belt since its founding and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=474.099s">[Bears]</a>: Whereas Tom Lincoln led the efforts for the permanent preservation and conservation of the Medford Brooks estate, including both the historic buildings and open space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=481.702s">[Bears]</a>: And whereas Tom Lincoln has volunteered tens of thousands of hours to Medford over the past 30 years, helping to draft legislation to establish M-BELT, run hundreds of meetings and events, recruit volunteers, raise funds, write grants, and be the public face of M-BELT to the Medford and regional community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=496.669s">[Bears]</a>: And whereas after decades of service, Tom Lincoln recently stepped down as M-BELT president and has returned to the ranks of volunteers and citizen advocates,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=503.792s">[Bears]</a>: Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we congratulate Tom Lincoln on his storied career, preserving and restoring this essential city-owned property for future generations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=513.318s">[Bears]</a>: Be it further resolved that we invite Mr. Lincoln to attend a future city council meeting to present him with a citation for his achievement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=519.642s">[Bears]</a>: Be it further resolved that we invite the entire Medford community to attend the annual Brooks Estate picnic on Saturday, July 13th, 2024 from 12 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=527.626s">[Bears]</a>: to 3 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=528.227s">[Bears]</a>: at the Shepherd Brooks Manor to enjoy food,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=530.475s">[Bears]</a>: community and to celebrate Tom Lincoln's work to preserve and conserve the Medford Brooks estate for all time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=536.327s">[Bears]</a>: Any comments by members of the council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=538.791s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Lemme.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=594.149s">[Bears]</a>: Any further comment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=595.15s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=725.489s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=727.09s">[Bears]</a>: And I have been lucky to serve now for five years as the City Council's representative on the MBELT board and work with Tom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=736.455s">[Bears]</a>: And Tom's tenacity, his experiences, frustration with the pace of change are all something that I've come<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=745.427s">[Bears]</a>: to know very well, and I am excited to thank him and congratulate him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=749.688s">[Bears]</a>: He is going to keep working with the Brooks Estate and on the Brooks Estate, which I think is fantastic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=755.949s">[Bears]</a>: We also have a new president, Carly Nesson, a Medford resident who stepped up to take on the role, and we're really excited to see what the next 30 years at the Brooks Estate looks like as we hope to finalize the master plan that was started 10 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=772.172s">[Bears]</a>: Much of it has been done in terms of the restoration of the building, and now it is time to build the access drive, finish the restoration, and make sure that everyone in every part of Medford can access the wonderful open space that is the Brooks Estate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=785.321s">[Bears]</a>: So thank you all for your comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=788.143s">[Bears]</a>: I'm sure Tom appreciates them, and is there a motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=793.507s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion approved by Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=797.33s">[Bears]</a>: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=820.678s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, seven from the affirmative and the negative, the motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=823.719s">[Bears]</a>: 24-430, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we congratulate Sylvia de Placido on her retirement as assistant city clerk and thank her for her decades of public service to the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=836.521s">[Bears]</a>: Before I go to councilors, I do have a statement from the city clerk who could not be here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=842.102s">[Bears]</a>: He didn't know when he made plans that Sylvia would be retiring, so he's traveling, but he did want to say something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=849.397s">[Bears]</a>: He said, inside room 103, I am the city clerk, but Sylvia is the boss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=854.679s">[Bears]</a>: Capitalized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=856.299s">[Bears]</a>: Even though I am a Springsteen fan of more than four decades, Sylvia is still the boss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=861.561s">[Bears]</a>: She gave this city 32 years of selfless, dedicated service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=864.762s">[Bears]</a>: If we count Dorothy Donahue's tenure as acting city clerk, and we should, then Sylvia has worked with four different city clerks, beginning with Joe McGonigal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=871.884s">[Bears]</a>: She knows everything there is to know about the city clerk's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=874.185s">[Bears]</a>: She's our living encyclopedia for literally everything our office touches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=878.306s">[Bears]</a>: Sylvia leads by example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=880.007s">[Bears]</a>: Behind her seemingly gruff exterior is one of the kindest, funniest people we will ever know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=884.248s">[Bears]</a>: Sylvia's patience and humor have pulled our entire team through some particularly challenging times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=889.149s">[Bears]</a>: She has been an incredible teacher and mentor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=891.57s">[Bears]</a>: She is completely unafraid to tell me what I need to know, when and how I need to know it, in words that are unequivocal and easy to comprehend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=898.232s">[Bears]</a>: She is constitutionally incapable of sugarcoating anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=902.062s">[Bears]</a>: These are virtues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=903.983s">[Bears]</a>: I will miss Sylvia's daily presence, but she's about to find out that she's only a phone call away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=908.664s">[Bears]</a>: I'm thrilled for her as she embarks on her hard-earned, well-deserved retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=912.325s">[Bears]</a>: My hope for her is nothing but happiness and more priceless time on the lake with Peter, Michael, Peter, Mark, and her beloved grandchildren.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=919.687s">[Bears]</a>: Well done, boss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=920.747s">[Bears]</a>: Well done, and thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=922.388s">[Bears]</a>: It bears repeating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1015.397s">[Bears]</a>: Vice president Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1200.882s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you and just I want to say congratulations and your service has been so appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1209.164s">[Bears]</a>: And my three terms, my first term, I didn't get to know as well because you were in here and many of us were not in this building during the pandemic, but you were here with the clerk's team processing birth certificates, marriages, death certificates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1223.449s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, it is the basics of civic life that run through our clerk's office, nevermind council agendas, which may not be the basics, but there's something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1235.086s">[Bears]</a>: since I've been vice president, now president, especially this past couple of years, I've spent a lot of time in the clerk's office and I've appreciated your humor, your welcoming me and pointing out that I may be sitting at the desk too much and shouldn't be an honorary member of the clerk's team as often, but always made me feel welcome and always tried to feed me candy and cookies, which,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1261.923s">[Bears]</a>: I appreciate and my doctor regrets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1264.044s">[Bears]</a>: So it's been a real joy to spend time with you, Sylvia, and to get to know you and to see the end of many years of service, just the last tail end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1275.991s">[Bears]</a>: I didn't get to see the first 26 years, but the last few have been a privilege.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1280.554s">[Bears]</a>: So congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1282.195s">[Bears]</a>: Enjoy the pontoon boat with the family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1285.357s">[Bears]</a>: And I'll miss having you here too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1287.938s">[Bears]</a>: When Adam wasn't here, it's been great to chair meetings with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1291.772s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1294.093s">[Bears]</a>: Would anyone from the public like to speak on this item?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1298.535s">[Bears]</a>: You can come to the podium or raise your hand on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1304.478s">[Bears]</a>: All right, Madam Clerk, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1307.739s">[Bears]</a>: Well, I need a motion first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1308.9s">[Bears]</a>: Is there a motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1310.501s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion to approve by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Tseng, Madam Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1331.767s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1332.348s">[Bears]</a>: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1333.768s">[Bears]</a>: The motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1345.614s">[Bears]</a>: 24-431, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we congratulate Janice DePace on her retirement as principal clerk and thank her for her decades of public service to the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1358.802s">[Bears]</a>: Go to councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1360.783s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1525.266s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1525.606s">[Bears]</a>: Now I'm gonna read from the clerk about Janice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1532.793s">[Bears]</a>: Janice does a little of everything in our office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1534.775s">[Bears]</a>: She brought vast knowledge and experience with her when she came to City Hall from the schools, and she has transformed operations for our team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1541.481s">[Bears]</a>: She has been a go-to resource for businesses, dog owners, restaurants, retail establishments, and anybody who needs information related to city government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1548.627s">[Bears]</a>: Speaking of go-to resources, she's been a go-to resource for everybody at City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1552.87s">[Bears]</a>: She arrived at the clerk's office with a large network of teachers and former students, all of whom she remembers by name, when they arrive in Room 103 for copies of their birth certificates, to file their marriage intentions, and to renew their dog licenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1564.517s">[Bears]</a>: and all of whom remember her by name with kind words as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1567.299s">[Bears]</a>: Janice nails our customer service mission every single day, leading with kindness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1571.323s">[Bears]</a>: She has passion for her job, combined with skills that can't be taught in any training session, along with a cosmetology license for anybody who might need a quick cut or trim.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1579.65s">[Bears]</a>: She enjoys our customers and her colleagues, and they enjoy her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1582.772s">[Bears]</a>: She leaves City Hall with many years of service to our city and our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1585.935s">[Bears]</a>: I'm grateful for the work that she's done and for her friendship, commitment, and humor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1589.438s">[Bears]</a>: She has made our city a better place in which to live and work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1591.96s">[Bears]</a>: I wish her the best on her next adventure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1596.175s">[Bears]</a>: And I will just say to Janice that it has also been a privilege to serve and see her service in the clerk's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1606.082s">[Bears]</a>: Similarly to Sylvia, Janice has always made me feel welcome in the office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1611.466s">[Bears]</a>: We always have a story to exchange or a bit of news to share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1617.231s">[Bears]</a>: But I think especially something to say is, I think it's both a testament to their<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1624.144s">[Bears]</a>: being great colleagues and friends, but also a loss at the same time that Janice and Sylvia get to go out together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1632.007s">[Bears]</a>: They both get to retire luckily at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1634.648s">[Bears]</a>: And I think maybe neither of them could have imagined serving without the other in the office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1640.59s">[Bears]</a>: So they both have dedicated so many years of service and are able to step out into their retirement or their next adventure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1650.134s">[Bears]</a>: together, and I think that's a beautiful story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1652.055s">[Bears]</a>: So, with that, is there a motion on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1655.876s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion by Councilor Tseng to approve, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro, Madam Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1676.784s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1677.064s">[Bears]</a>: Seven in the affirmative, none of the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1678.465s">[Bears]</a>: The motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1686.443s">[Bears]</a>: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate Donna Lasky on her retirement from her long and storied career as a teacher in the Medford Public Schools and thank Mrs. Lasky for her years of service and care for Medford students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1980.316s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1983.017s">[Bears]</a>: I was neither a student or a parent or a colleague of Donna Lasky, but I was a student at Medford High with a Lasky child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1992.062s">[Bears]</a>: And I just know the impact that that family has had at multiple generations on this community and the service they provided to the city and to our young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2001.666s">[Bears]</a>: So I'm incredibly grateful for Donna and for all of you for being in Medford and giving so much to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2008.993s">[Bears]</a>: Any further comments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2709.392s">[Bears]</a>: We do have an update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2712.153s">[Bears]</a>: We received a letter from Habit Opco LLC today, June 25th, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2720.095s">[Bears]</a>: I'll read it now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2720.836s">[Bears]</a>: Re Habit Opco LLC application for a special permit for Treatment Center 360 Salem Street, Medford, Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2727.478s">[Bears]</a>: Dear city councilors, we're writing on behalf of Habit Opco in connection with tonight's city council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2731.839s">[Bears]</a>: As you know, on April 16th, Habit Opco applied for a special permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2735.34s">[Bears]</a>: for a comprehensive treatment center, quote, CTC proposed for 360 Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2740.161s">[Bears]</a>: Yesterday, we learned of a proposed resolution, 24-426, placed on the meeting agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2747.202s">[Bears]</a>: The resolution urges the city council to impose a citywide moratorium on opioid treatment programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2751.963s">[Bears]</a>: We thought you should know that Habit Opco is withdrawing its special permit application for 360 Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2757.265s">[Bears]</a>: It intends to search for a different location within Medford,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2760.08s">[Bears]</a>: We made this decision carefully after meeting with officials, reviewing public comments, and weighing relevant considerations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2765.481s">[Bears]</a>: As you know, after filing its application, HABIT OPCO reached out to city staff and officials, including city councilors, to discuss any concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2772.022s">[Bears]</a>: It is an open-door policy to discussing issues and considering feedback, and we intended to approach the special permit hearing with the same openness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2778.744s">[Bears]</a>: We still feel we could address neighborhood concerns, but we recognize that there are times when a certain amount of adversity can undermine a cause.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2785.385s">[Bears]</a>: We take as genuine the comments of many Medford residents that they are not averse to the use<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2790.346s">[Bears]</a>: or blind to the need, but have concerns with the proposed location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2793.688s">[Bears]</a>: Habit Opco is committed to ensuring that victims of the opioid crises have access to life-saving medical care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2799.072s">[Bears]</a>: Medication-assisted treatment is the best tool we have to combat that crisis that has claimed thousands of lives in Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2804.275s">[Bears]</a>: There's an urgent need for treatment facilities, yet locations are not easy to find.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2809.439s">[Bears]</a>: We look forward to working with the city to find an appropriate location for a CTC, and we thank all of those who have provided helpful insights over the last two months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2817.503s">[Bears]</a>: Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2819.905s">[Bears]</a>: Douglas Troyer, attorney for Habit OpCo LLC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2823.169s">[Bears]</a>: We also have Planning Director Hunt and legal representation here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2826.692s">[Bears]</a>: And with that, I will turn over to Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2829.115s">[Bears]</a>: I will just remind everyone again, the application has been withdrawn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2832.098s">[Bears]</a>: The council is not the special permit granting authority for this type of use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2836.082s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3378.797s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3379.377s">[Bears]</a>: And thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3380.458s">[Bears]</a>: I think we have noted here that all of the parties involved, whether it's the city council and city councilors or planning office or residents and community members who are engaged and even the petitioner, as they noted in their letter, they did want to hear the feedback of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3398.453s">[Bears]</a>: They did want to engage in good faith.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3399.835s">[Bears]</a>: They did want to do this the right way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3401.596s">[Bears]</a>: So that is where we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3404.057s">[Bears]</a>: We have an intent and an approach, I think, to work together to find a site, if they want to continue looking in Medford, that meets community needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3413.139s">[Bears]</a>: And I think that is what we ask of everyone who petitions for a special permit of any kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3419.18s">[Bears]</a>: I also want to note that the zoning we have now does need to be updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3422.361s">[Bears]</a>: We're working through that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3424.321s">[Bears]</a>: This was a special permit process, so there still would have been a process to require.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3427.983s">[Bears]</a>: They couldn't just come in and do it in a residential area, which I think is an important point to note.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3433.427s">[Bears]</a>: We do have the planning director and council present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3436.869s">[Bears]</a>: I do want to invite Director Hunt up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3439.651s">[Bears]</a>: to speak, and then I'm hoping we can refer this to the committee to come up with something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3445.035s">[Bears]</a>: I know that we got some legal advice around the specific structure of something like this, how it would need to be structured.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3451.519s">[Bears]</a>: People with substance use disorders are a protected class, so we have to be very careful in the legal construction of anything around this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3459.665s">[Bears]</a>: Right now, if we were to institute something with the current zoning, we would ban any medical office from opening in the city of Medford whatsoever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3466.988s">[Bears]</a>: So we really need to go through the diligent process to get this right and follow the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3471.329s">[Bears]</a>: So that's what we will do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3472.65s">[Bears]</a>: And with that, I will go to the Director of Planning, Development and Sustainability, Alicia Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3765.99s">[Bears]</a>: I just wanted to confirm what you just said for simplicity's sake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3770.333s">[Bears]</a>: The application has been withdrawn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3771.734s">[Bears]</a>: There's currently no application to consider this from this company anywhere in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3775.876s">[Bears]</a>: It will be withdrawn at tomorrow night's City Community Development Board meeting, Thursday's Zoning Board of Appeals meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3782.32s">[Bears]</a>: And as discussed in the letter and as discussed by Councilor Scarpelli, the intent of all parties is to have more discussions about as a city developing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3792.146s">[Bears]</a>: and looking at this in the zoning context and from the applicant working in good faith with the city and community members to find a site if they want to continue in Medford, that is not in a residential area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3803.712s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3804.613s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3945.66s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3945.9s">[Bears]</a>: Is there a motion on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3947.001s">[Bears]</a>: I'll go to Councilor Lazzaro, but was there a motion to refer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3950.043s">[Bears]</a>: I couldn't quite tell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3977.503s">[Bears]</a>: I did invite the director and council up for specific questions to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3980.585s">[Bears]</a>: So I will, we'll do that and then we'll go around and then we'll be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3983.427s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4091.681s">[Bears]</a>: This is a question for Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4094.483s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4109.214s">[Bears]</a>: We're not going to do this tonight, y'all, so...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4115.919s">[Bears]</a>: All right, would you, we can stop right now if we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4120.442s">[Bears]</a>: Please don't disrupt the public meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4123.464s">[Bears]</a>: Please don't disrupt the public meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4125.506s">[Bears]</a>: We have a good resolution here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4127.587s">[Bears]</a>: And if you want, we can shut this down right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4137.594s">[Bears]</a>: We have a motion to refer to planning and permitting committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4140.416s">[Bears]</a>: Is there any further questions or comment for council or for the planning director?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4148.0s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4164.576s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4166.698s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4171.354s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to refer to Planning Committee and Permanent Committee for further discussions around zoning, seconded by Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4245.932s">[Bears]</a>: I'm happy to take it up under public participation or public participation item from Charles Rodriguez.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4262.305s">[Bears]</a>: I'm gonna keep reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6419.588s">[Bears]</a>: Hello, participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6420.55s">[Bears]</a>: We have Cheryl Rodriguez.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6424.437s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6425.92s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6649.073s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6649.373s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6811.283s">[Bears]</a>: You have 30 seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6836.104s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, and just, I can answer some of your question if you want, in terms of procedurally next steps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6842.027s">[Bears]</a>: So the council voted on the paper that had been proposed, and we'll be looking at the zoning element of this, which is within our purview, and what the state law allows us to do, what the legal cases allow us to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6853.272s">[Bears]</a>: In terms of, in general, prevention, health, addressing substance use disorder, and the opioid crisis, we do have the Office of Prevention and Outreach, which has done some really great work on that in this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6865.878s">[Bears]</a>: and they convened the Preserving Mental and Behavioral Health Commission, which we established three or so years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6872.987s">[Bears]</a>: In terms of the rights of providers, right, I get the four R's, and I think it's important for the city to engage in looking at that, but the provider themselves as a corporate entity, non-profit or for-profit,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6885.802s">[Bears]</a>: they do have a right to petition for zoning or to want to open a business or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6890.204s">[Bears]</a>: So the city can't control them from coming and asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6893.426s">[Bears]</a>: And then we have to follow the laws of the public process as laid out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6897.288s">[Bears]</a>: So I think that's why you found, you know, that there's all this, you know, there was a special permit of the zoning board for this use in this district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6905.071s">[Bears]</a>: So that's the process that outlines there, what has to happen there, engaging those other bodies, you know, in a more holistic look at mental health and behavioral health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6914.876s">[Bears]</a>: That is the work of the Office of Prevention and Outreach, but they don't actually have approval or denial authority over special permits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6921.585s">[Bears]</a>: So that's why there's some mismatch there and why certain groups are engaged in certain elements of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6932.198s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7109.517s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7110.297s">[Bears]</a>: I would just note that the City Council does not have the authority or control over pretty much anything that was just stated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7213.997s">[Bears]</a>: If someone could unmute Marie, for some reason I'm not a co-host right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7379.123s">[Bears]</a>: All right, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7385.592s">[Bears]</a>: Go to the podium, name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7454.929s">[Bears]</a>: Name is Zoom, Jess H. And I will note that if there is a reapplication, it would have to follow the public process and there would be a special permit process with the Zoning Board of Appeals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7467.492s">[Bears]</a>: Jess, you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7468.572s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7611.342s">[Bears]</a>: The Office of Prevention and Outreach does work on this and the health department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7616.524s">[Bears]</a>: And in terms of the application, the city did not solicit this private business to apply for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7621.285s">[Bears]</a>: They decided to apply for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7635.602s">[Bears]</a>: It's based on the zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7637.002s">[Bears]</a>: If they wanted to go back to the site, if they were, for example, to reapply, the zoning board of appeals would approve a special permit for this use in that district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7648.326s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7650.427s">[Bears]</a>: Podium name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7843.107s">[Bears]</a>: I would note, once again, a vote was taken, and per the council rules, once a vote is taken and disposed with, that concludes the discussion on the paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7851.031s">[Bears]</a>: So, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7852.611s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8107.676s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8128.283s">[Bears]</a>: I haven't said that once, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8232.974s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8535.658s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Jones, I would just note, Mr. Jones, the application was withdrawn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8540.723s">[Bears]</a>: I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8541.363s">[Bears]</a>: So I'm just going to speak now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8543.325s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8544.186s">[Bears]</a>: So the application was withdrawn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8546.708s">[Bears]</a>: The council's not the special permit granting authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8549.531s">[Bears]</a>: It's not our role under the state chapter 40 a zoning law for us to insert ourselves in the special permit process of another special permit granting authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8557.235s">[Bears]</a>: And I think you heard from all of the city staff involved from many Councilors that we wanted and from the proponent from everyone here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8566.188s">[Bears]</a>: And people have emailed me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8567.549s">[Bears]</a>: If you got an email back from me, I think you'll know what I said in the email back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8571.372s">[Bears]</a>: I said, I don't think this is the right place, and I don't think this is the right process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8575.295s">[Bears]</a>: The right location, or the right place as being in Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8578.878s">[Bears]</a>: The right location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8580.379s">[Bears]</a>: Most of the responses have said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8582.541s">[Bears]</a>: We believe that this has a place in the spectrum of treatment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8585.904s">[Bears]</a>: We'd like to see it in a commercial industrial district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8588.586s">[Bears]</a>: I think you would find that basically everyone who acted and was involved in this process from the city side, whether that's the planning office, representatives from the health department, members of the city council, we worked to play our role as best as we could to have the public comment heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8604.398s">[Bears]</a>: And the result was that the applicant said, we heard this isn't gonna work here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8609.096s">[Bears]</a>: and we're withdrawing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8610.377s">[Bears]</a>: So the result is it's not coming, the application is not applied, and now we wanna come and work with all parties involved to put this in a place where people feel comfortable that it should be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8620.103s">[Bears]</a>: So that was what happened, that was the result, and I think that's being lost a little bit in this discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8626.388s">[Bears]</a>: So I just wanted to state that when we talk about what roles different people played in the process here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8661.587s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8661.947s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8662.468s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8985.776s">[Bears]</a>: Any further public comment on the matter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8988.877s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing no hands on Zoom and no one at the line in the chambers of the podium,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8996.902s">[Bears]</a>: It's public participation so can make motions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9001.992s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, if you want to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9257.244s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9260.998s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to address the record, please, in three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9298.84s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I'm still on the three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9300.92s">[Bears]</a>: Hey, Zach, I'm still on my three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9303.161s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, you can be done now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9304.702s">[Bears]</a>: You can be done here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9313.206s">[Bears]</a>: You have no clue why this person isn't here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9315.827s">[Bears]</a>: You have no idea what, Steve, can we have a conversation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9319.988s">[Bears]</a>: Okay, can you stop interrupting me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9321.969s">[Bears]</a>: Please stop interrupting me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9323.95s">[Bears]</a>: I want to note to you that you have no idea why this Councilor is not present, and maybe they had a major personal issue in their life today and are still showing up at this meeting, and I'd like you to give them a little grace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9343.735s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks, Steve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9344.616s">[Bears]</a>: We'll see about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9347.219s">[Bears]</a>: All right, Steve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9351.103s">[Bears]</a>: Please direct your comments to the chair and please avoid your personal diatribes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9354.626s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9415.623s">[Bears]</a>: In cities like- That's not true, we do have a- Oh, you do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9417.863s">[Bears]</a>: We have a social team, yeah, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9500.646s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I would once again note that given the Chapter 48 zoning process and that the Zoning Board of Appeals is a special permit-granting authority, it is generally not recommended for the Council to insert politics into situations or to be serving as political actors in permitting processes because it opens the cities up to liability and lawsuit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9521.818s">[Bears]</a>: Would you like to speak?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9524.12s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9525.14s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9643.391s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you for your comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9647.233s">[Bears]</a>: And I just want to say for my record, since we're throwing around the shame on thing, the people in the room laughing at that comment, I'm disappointed in you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9656.618s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9938.005s">[Bears]</a>: Madam Chief of Staff, do you wanna share anything about these applicants?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9945.231s">[Bears]</a>: And if I am correct, I just wanted to, and you can correct me, state law requires the License Commission to have partisan balance because of probably 100 years ago, we're only given licenses to people from our own party, something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9972.299s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9974.76s">[Bears]</a>: If there's anything you want to add about the applicants, it looks like they are for reappointment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11742.366s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know why it's not showing up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11758.076s">[Bears]</a>: Justin, Matt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11760.778s">[Bears]</a>: We're sending Gen Z. We're sending Gen Z out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11764.52s">[Bears]</a>: Although technically, apparently millennials are better at computers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11766.822s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11768.41s">[Bears]</a>: all that time on the smartphones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12298.623s">[Bears]</a>: Last slide, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12562.0s">[Bears]</a>: And for those who have not seen Chris zoom in to a public meeting, Chris lives in a historic home where people of my height may occasionally knock their heads on a doorframe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12584.614s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, George Washington did not choose to cite his headquarters in that home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12593.503s">[Bears]</a>: A joke for me and Larry and Chris.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12596.145s">[Bears]</a>: Council, any more questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12598.067s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13376.124s">[Bears]</a>: Any further comments from members of the Council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13379.169s">[Bears]</a>: I for one, South Street is just one of our most beautiful historic neighborhoods and I've been in the 21 Toro house and I remember the deep concerns with grandfather's house and yeah I mean this is one that just makes sense to me out of the gate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13394.201s">[Bears]</a>: I know a couple years ago we were talking about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13396.84s">[Bears]</a>: the one parcel on foster court and I voted for it, didn't pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13401.501s">[Bears]</a>: But this is contiguous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13403.202s">[Bears]</a>: It's so well evidenced, deeply supported.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13406.302s">[Bears]</a>: The process has been so long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13408.083s">[Bears]</a>: I personally would be a strong proponent of approving it for first reading tonight myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13412.164s">[Bears]</a>: But, you know, I just think this is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13416.65s">[Bears]</a>: This is exactly the place we need to go and I mean we see the pit right now on on South Street, next to that 5054.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13423.739s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13425.402s">[Bears]</a>: And you know, again, I'm a huge proponent of building more housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13430.268s">[Bears]</a>: But, and I think you brought up the grandfather's house case as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13434.218s">[Bears]</a>: a little bit of a difference in outward appearance would have made a huge difference in the impact of that new construction on that property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13439.941s">[Bears]</a>: 54 has already gone through, so that as well will not have, but I mean, I think they made some decent considerations and historical commission has had some leverage with the preferably preserved, but this is a neighborhood where, you know, I don't think we got enough necessarily and a neighborhood that really needs it because it is just a major historic quarter with some historic buildings that still have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13461.653s">[Bears]</a>: have not been switched to vinyl siding and have not had their main features and historic features just completely stripped and ripped away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13470.356s">[Bears]</a>: So I really see this neighborhood as 100% and this district specifically as constructed as a place to move ahead personally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13478.659s">[Bears]</a>: So thank you for your work on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13514.841s">[Bears]</a>: Currently, any further comments from members of the council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13517.201s">[Bears]</a>: We have a motion on the floor from Vice President Collins to refer to planning and permitting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13522.242s">[Bears]</a>: Is there a second on that motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13524.463s">[Bears]</a>: Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13527.383s">[Bears]</a>: Is there any comments by members of the public on this item?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13529.924s">[Bears]</a>: Raise your hands on Zoom or come to the podium and share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14044.387s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14045.728s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion by members of the Council or the public?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14047.989s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14061.976s">[Bears]</a>: We do have a motion on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14063.177s">[Bears]</a>: We can't have a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14064.758s">[Bears]</a>: So we would have to vote that motion or without that motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14068.581s">[Bears]</a>: And this is an ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14069.742s">[Bears]</a>: I'll just read it really quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14070.703s">[Bears]</a>: This would amend sections 4851 and 4852 of the municipal code to include the words fixes what adds to the list and a South Street historic district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14084.958s">[Bears]</a>: twice in section 4851 and once in section 4852, and it also would set forth that the South Street Historic District is and shall hereby be created with the boundaries of the said South Street Historic District being as shown on the map entitled South Street Historic District prepared by the City of Medford Historic District Commission dated November 9th, 2023, a copy of which is on file with the city clerk and is to be recorded at the Middlesex South District Registry of Deeds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14111.587s">[Bears]</a>: So that is the vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14113.905s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro, do you have a further comment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14127.848s">[Bears]</a>: If you turn your microphone, if these front two microphones are technically in front of the speakers, and I think the speakers are very loud tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14135.829s">[Bears]</a>: It's just where I'm sitting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14176.062s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14280.809s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, five in the affirmative, two in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14283.311s">[Bears]</a>: The motion passes to approve for first reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14285.433s">[Bears]</a>: It meets the two-thirds threshold, and it will go on the, it'll be advertised for second reading in the Medford Transcript and Somerville Journal, and then we will come back before this body for a third reading once that advertising period is complete.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14299.483s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14430.475s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, and maybe a first time we've heard a little monster in the council chamber.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14565.633s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just glad it's not like Lady Gaga branded and we're not paying extra for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14569.756s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14570.756s">[Bears]</a>: I have a motion of Councilor Skidmore to approve, seconded by?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14572.918s">[Bears]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14573.278s">[Bears]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14574.839s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14576.26s">[Bears]</a>: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14577.641s">[Bears]</a>: This is on 24425.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14578.021s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14589.727s">[Bears]</a>: She's still with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14595.31s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14596.091s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14596.191s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14600.534s">[Bears]</a>: Oh, there we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14629.498s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, I mean, then the negative emotion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14635.042s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14639.385s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, and all my papers are a little bit out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14666.214s">[Bears]</a>: 24427, appropriation for Medford High School MSBA feasibility study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14673.241s">[Bears]</a>: Dear President Bears and members of the City Council, I respect the request and recommend that your Honorable Body vote as reviewed, the following as reviewed by the Massachusetts School Business Authority, I think I should say School Building Authority, and we may need to correct that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14686.491s">[Bears]</a>: that the City of Medford appropriates the amount of $3 million, $3 million, for the purpose of paying costs for the feasibility study for Medford High School, currently located at 489 Winthrop Street, Medford, Massachusetts, including the payment of all costs, incidental or related thereto, and for which the City of Medford may be eligible for a grant from the Massachusetts School Building Authority, MSBA, and the set amount to be expended under the direction of the Medford Comprehensive High School Building Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14710.799s">[Bears]</a>: To meet this appropriation, the Mayor, with the approval of the City Council, proposes the use of $3 million in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14716.101s">[Bears]</a>: The City of Medford acknowledges that the MSBA's grant program is a non-entitlement discretionary program based on need, as determined by the MSBA, and any costs the City of Medford incurs in excess of the grant approved by and received from the MSBA shall be the sole responsibility of the City of Medford, and that the amount authorized pursuant to this vote shall be reduced by any grant amount set forth in the feasibility study agreement that may be executed between the City of Medford and the MSBA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14738.852s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you for your kind attention in this matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14740.953s">[Bears]</a>: Respectfully submitted, Breanna Lungo-Koehn, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14743.134s">[Bears]</a>: And I will go to the Chief of Staff,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14745.12s">[Bears]</a>: for a presentation of the paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14804.318s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14804.838s">[Bears]</a>: I will go to Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14806.219s">[Bears]</a>: Council Lazzaro, Vice President Collins, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15030.916s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, whereas chapter 43, section 22 applies to ordinances and their multiple readings, and none of the papers require multiple readings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15040.538s">[Bears]</a>: We're gonna keep moving on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15043.459s">[Bears]</a>: I have a question to the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15061.855s">[Bears]</a>: Do you have a written legal opinion I can review?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15066.202s">[Bears]</a>: Is there a written legal opinion for review by the chair?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15074.639s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, Chapter 43, Section 22 applies to ordinances for multiple readings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15078.28s">[Bears]</a>: General law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15079.38s">[Bears]</a>: I'm reading it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15087.923s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, it reads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15098.746s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, do you have a written legal opinion for the chair on this matter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15101.747s">[Bears]</a>: I will get you that tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15103.747s">[Bears]</a>: I limit choice of the discretion of the chairs that I read.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15107.028s">[Bears]</a>: I'll read chapter 43, section 22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15108.289s">[Bears]</a>: Any ordinance order or resolution may be passed through all its stages of legislation at one session, provided that no member of the council objects thereto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15116.532s">[Bears]</a>: But if any member of the council objects, the measure shall be postponed for that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15119.834s">[Bears]</a>: Ordinances have multiple stages of legislation, a first reading, a second reading, and a third reading, whereas none of the paper, at least the paper before us, and if your intent is to apply it to 24428, 24432,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15132.859s">[Bears]</a>: 24433 and 24434.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15137.335s">[Bears]</a>: Well, I'd have to read 24434.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15139.937s">[Bears]</a>: That may be an ordinance amendment, but at least the first four are not ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15143.319s">[Bears]</a>: They don't require multiple stages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15145.52s">[Bears]</a>: And therefore the objection doesn't apply and the rule, the law doesn't apply.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15149.263s">[Bears]</a>: The law does because if the council would like to provide a legal opinion to the chair, we've done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15162.632s">[Bears]</a>: There's a motion to challenge the ruling of the chair by councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15166.575s">[Bears]</a>: Is there a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15172.059s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion to challenge the ruling of the chair by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15175.703s">[Bears]</a>: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15177.945s">[Bears]</a>: No, it isn't debatable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15179.286s">[Bears]</a>: It's not debatable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15180.327s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, the principle here is absolutely unquestionable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15183.67s">[Bears]</a>: The motion is not debatable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15208.426s">[Bears]</a>: No, I think it has plenty of due diligence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15211.048s">[Bears]</a>: There you go, rule 22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15212.569s">[Bears]</a>: The motion's undebatable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15214.351s">[Bears]</a>: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15215.952s">[Bears]</a>: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15219.406s">[Bears]</a>: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15227.83s">[Bears]</a>: This is on the motion to overrule the ruling of the chair that chapter 43, section 22 does not apply to this paper as this paper is not an ordinance that requires three readings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15242.658s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15249.286s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to the next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15258.889s">[Bears]</a>: Said no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15278.528s">[Bears]</a>: No negative emotion fails the ruling of the chairs that chapter 43 section 22 does not apply to this I would appreciate if you could provide it tonight without legal fighting for transparency and open government<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15310.127s">[Bears]</a>: Well, you know, again, there's been no evidence presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15328.527s">[Bears]</a>: We're gonna maintain business and we're gonna move forward on this item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15333.489s">[Bears]</a>: Oh, so many people are so, so many accusations of shame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15338.65s">[Bears]</a>: So many accusations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15340.891s">[Bears]</a>: Let's move ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15342.371s">[Bears]</a>: I would like to continue on this item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15344.992s">[Bears]</a>: Are these questions related to the item before us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15347.713s">[Bears]</a>: I'll go to Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Leming and Vice President Collins and then Councilor Sviggum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15354.335s">[Bears]</a>: Forum is for, required.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15356.275s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15357.176s">[Bears]</a>: And yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15442.694s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15443.314s">[Bears]</a>: And just before we continue, I just want to explain the free cash process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15449.8s">[Bears]</a>: As Councilor Lazzaro was noting, the previous free cash certification was for July 1 of 2022.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15456.947s">[Bears]</a>: That was in the amount of $25 million and change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15460.97s">[Bears]</a>: Last week, the Department of the Division of Local Services, I believe,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15465.534s">[Bears]</a>: issued a free cash certification for the city as of July 1, 2023.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15470.759s">[Bears]</a>: While the free cash amount was not certified, and that amount was $34 million, while that amount had not been certified when the financial task force was having its discussions, we were very aware<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15482.128s">[Bears]</a>: that the reason for free cash balance amounts and the certification of amounts was due to essentially three factors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15490.211s">[Bears]</a>: One was the use of ARPA funds provided by the federal government instead of free cash in many situations over the past three fiscal years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15498.075s">[Bears]</a>: The second was the conservative estimation of local receipts as part of revenues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15503.197s">[Bears]</a>: I see Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15505.258s">[Bears]</a>: Was the conservative estimation of local receipts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15509.039s">[Bears]</a>: As part of the local revenues, as we heard from our finance director this year, the amount estimated for local receipts for the fiscal 25 budget is at the upper bounds of comfort of what we have submitted, and I'm seeing a smirk and smile.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15523.73s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Dickinson, and it's a fingers crossed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15528.112s">[Bears]</a>: And the third was turned back to open positions, most of which have been filled, there was no expectation whatsoever by anyone familiar with the finances of the city that we will continue to see free cash balance increases of five to $10 million a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15542.698s">[Bears]</a>: Those are not reliable revenue sources, they're not stable revenue sources, and they are not responsible revenue sources to base our budgets on or to suggest that we have enough funding for Medford Public Schools or for DPW or for a new Medford Fire Headquarters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15559.672s">[Bears]</a>: So those are the facts of free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15561.934s">[Bears]</a>: Those are the financial statistics of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15565.457s">[Bears]</a>: That is why even though there is a free cash balance certified<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15568.939s">[Bears]</a>: as of July 1, 2023 for fiscal 24, $34 million that we need the stable recurring revenues as proposed by the mayor and approved by the council for the override votes in November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15582.192s">[Bears]</a>: This is not, free cash is not a solution to those problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15584.614s">[Bears]</a>: It never has been and it never will be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15588.404s">[Bears]</a>: We also have this amount, which is good, basically thanks to the federal ARPA program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15594.027s">[Bears]</a>: There is a documentation in here outlining the draft free cash plan of the administration, which we can discuss tonight and consider further as a council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15605.113s">[Bears]</a>: It brings us back down very, very quickly with our capital needs to the 10 to $15 million range of free cash reserves recommended by all of the state financial agencies for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15617.833s">[Bears]</a>: communities to have I think it's between five and 7% of their annual budget in a reserve and that's where this will bring us so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15626.055s">[Bears]</a>: The federal ARPA program did give us some spending in recent years that we otherwise wouldn't have had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15630.776s">[Bears]</a>: It gave us a little boost to address capital needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15633.797s">[Bears]</a>: Those capital needs, even if we spent all 34 million on them tomorrow, would not address the massive capital deficit we have for our city facilities, school facilities, roads, sidewalks, water and sewer system, which as we've discussed at numerous meetings of this council, is in the hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15652.081s">[Bears]</a>: With that, I will go to Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16046.164s">[Bears]</a>: I'll second Vice President Collins' motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16051.028s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion on the MSBA feasibility study, or is there a motion on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16068.121s">[Bears]</a>: Is there a motion on the floor to approve by Councilor Lazzaro, by Councilor Collins?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16075.796s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16079.158s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion to approve this appropriation of $3 million for the MSBA, and is there an amendment to the paper to change business to building?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16091.804s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion to approve as amended by Vice President Collins, as seconded by Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16097.087s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16099.308s">[Bears]</a>: Discussion members of the public?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16100.709s">[Bears]</a>: Can I have an address for the record, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16101.87s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16208.226s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, the free cash balance that we have has come from unfilled positions, underestimated revenues, mainly in local receipts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16216.551s">[Bears]</a>: So not really from the property tax and from the use of federal funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16220.594s">[Bears]</a>: So we're now proposing to use those balances on these one-time expenditures like the feasibility study and the other things outlined in the plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16229.994s">[Bears]</a>: Your income was more than your expenses, our expenses that we budgeted for we were not able to spend because of things like, for example, 10 police officer positions were unfilled many things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16242.102s">[Bears]</a>: So, and there were many positions unfilled correct so any money that wasn't used then to pay for overtime was turned back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16249.767s">[Bears]</a>: But we still need to budget that money going forward otherwise we'd have to cut 10 police officers or cut those firefighters so for that wasn't that there was an overtaxing, it was that the budget was not able to be spent exactly how was expected in June of the prior year so we, but we still need to spend that money, we took in more money than we expended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16312.129s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, that's what we're trying to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16313.33s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to go to Mr. Castagnetti on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16315.972s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16317.193s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16323.277s">[Bears]</a>: Andrew, I'm unmuting you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16344.666s">[Bears]</a>: You may need to mute your television.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16421.262s">[Bears]</a>: I'm gonna go to Jess H on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16428.628s">[Bears]</a>: Jess, name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16430.189s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16442.617s">[Bears]</a>: This is being appropriated from the city's free cash reserve for the one time expense of the school building authority feasibility study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16457.375s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16459.097s">[Bears]</a>: Any further comment by members of the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16464.016s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none in the chamber and no hands on Zoom, on the motion of Vice President Collins, as seconded by Councilor Leming, Madam Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16473.379s">[Bears]</a>: As amended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16475.439s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16508.732s">[Bears]</a>: from Mayor Bernalino Kern to fund General Stabilization Establish and Fund Capital Stabilization Funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16514.814s">[Bears]</a>: Dear President Bears and members of the City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that Your Honorable Body vote to appropriate free cash in the amount of $6 million into the General Stabilization Fund established earlier this year by Your Honorable Body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16526.559s">[Bears]</a>: As you know, the vast majority of cities and towns in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts have a General Stabilization Fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16531.201s">[Bears]</a>: In order to provide for emergencies and unforeseen expenses,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16534.202s">[Bears]</a>: a simple majority of the City Council is required to appropriate funds into a stabilization fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16539.184s">[Bears]</a>: Further, in accordance with Chapter 40, Section 5b of the General Laws, I respect the request and recommend that Your Honorable Body take the following actions, each requiring a two-thirds majority vote of the City Council for establishment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16550.927s">[Bears]</a>: One, establish a capital stabilization fund and vote to approve $5 million of free cash to this fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16556.729s">[Bears]</a>: Two, establish a water and sewer capital stabilization fund<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16559.95s">[Bears]</a>: and vote to appropriate $2 million of retained earnings to this fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16563.292s">[Bears]</a>: As you are aware, free cash and retained earnings are only available after certification through June 30th of each year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16568.674s">[Bears]</a>: Each year without a stabilization fund, the city could face significant challenges in addressing emergencies or capital needs from July 1st until free cash is certified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16576.718s">[Bears]</a>: Chapter 40, section 5B of the general law stipulates that, quote, cities, towns, and districts may create one or more stabilization funds and appropriate any amount to the funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16585.543s">[Bears]</a>: The Division of Local Services, Financial Management Resource Bureau,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16588.684s">[Bears]</a>: Notes in a published article, quote, a city or town's capital assets are a vital part of providing essential services to residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16595.049s">[Bears]</a>: Capital assets include public buildings and structures, roadways, parks and fields, large equipment like dump trucks, mowers, fire engines, fire breathing apparatus, police cruisers, radio equipment, as well as land acquisitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16606.437s">[Bears]</a>: Major repairs to a capital asset or when it needs to be replaced unexpectedly or reaches its expected useful life early can be a significant shock to the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16614.523s">[Bears]</a>: Additionally, deferred maintenance of capital needs,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16618.218s">[Bears]</a>: Existing capital assets is a major contributor to capital failures, as these necessary upkeep costs are sometimes avoided in the interest of balancing the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16625.822s">[Bears]</a>: One way to better prepare for capital expenditures, both planned and unexpected, is to establish a special purpose capital stabilization fund dedicated to funding regular required capital repairs and maintenance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16635.548s">[Bears]</a>: In close, please find a draft free cash plan for your review and input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16638.57s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16640.07s">[Bears]</a>: Respectfully submitted, Breanna Lungo-Koehn, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16643.152s">[Bears]</a>: And in terms of the free cash plan, we have a free cash and retained earnings update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16648.516s">[Bears]</a>: Based on the unaudited balance sheet submitted, this is from the Department of Revenue Division of Local Services, notification of free cash approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16656.041s">[Bears]</a>: I hereby certify that the amount of available funds for free cash as of July 1 for City of Medford is General Fund $34,241,981, Enterprise Fund Water and Sewer $11,164,741,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16671.492s">[Bears]</a>: This certification is in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 59, Section 23 as amended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16676.617s">[Bears]</a>: As per requests to the Council dated June 18, 2024, I am requesting the following funds be appropriated from free cash, $6 million General Stabilization Fund, $5 million Capital Stabilization Fund, $3 million Mass School Building Authority Feasibility Study,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16691.071s">[Bears]</a>: for a total of $14 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16692.913s">[Bears]</a>: The capital stabilization funding mentioned would be a source for fiscal 2024 and prior year capital improvement needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16699.32s">[Bears]</a>: For the remaining funds, I anticipate the following future appropriation requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16703.084s">[Bears]</a>: I welcome the Council's input on future appropriation requests before my office and the finance team work to finalize an initial roadmap for the funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16710.592s">[Bears]</a>: $1 million additional funding to renovate the Hegner Center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16714.017s">[Bears]</a>: 2.5 million fire department fleet replacements, 2 million pension liability, 2 million fiscal year 2025 capital improvements, 2 million fiscal year 2026 capital improvements, $9.5 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16727.779s">[Bears]</a>: Please note that we do not anticipate future certifications to be as large as the last few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16732.141s">[Bears]</a>: There are many factors that contribute to the balance in free cash today, including conservative estimating of revenues in pandemic years, vacancies in personnel positions, health insurance budget turnbacks, and the availability of ARPA funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16743.327s">[Bears]</a>: While best practices still dictate that we should be somewhat conservative on revenue estimates, we push the envelope for fiscal 25 with our finance directors out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16750.37s">[Bears]</a>: We're now able to process personal hires faster than we were able to in the past, and we are not expecting any health insurance turnbacks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16756.315s">[Bears]</a>: Instead, actuals are showing a deficit for fiscal 24, and the ability to appropriate ARPA funds ends December 31, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16763.701s">[Bears]</a>: Finally, as the council may know, the Division of Local Services General Stabilization recommended goal is five to 7% of the current operating budget range.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16771.067s">[Bears]</a>: For Medford, five to 7% of the fiscal 25 budget would be 9.47, between 9.47 and 13.26 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16779.333s">[Bears]</a>: on funds certified for water sewer enterprise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16781.596s">[Bears]</a>: As the council knows, $2 million is proposed for a capital stabilization fund specifically for water and sewer, and the city is presently performing a water system analysis capital plan and rate study, which will help further inform the city in its planning efforts to address the aging water infrastructure across the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16796.71s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16798.191s">[Bears]</a>: Respectfully submitted, Reinaldo Kernmayer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16801.074s">[Bears]</a>: So right there, we're talking about $25 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16805.915s">[Bears]</a>: sorry, $23.5 million of that $34 million going either to stabilization funds or specific projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16812.139s">[Bears]</a>: There was a request for us to review an input on the free cash plan, so at some point we should discuss how we want to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16819.224s">[Bears]</a>: And with that, I will go to Vice President Collins and then Chief of Staff Nazarian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16823.887s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16935.356s">[Bears]</a>: On the, I'm just gonna put it out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16937.337s">[Bears]</a>: I'm gonna go to the Chief of Staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16938.218s">[Bears]</a>: We have a B paper to schedule a committee of the whole with the administration to discuss the draft free cash plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16947.182s">[Bears]</a>: And then Councilor Collins has also made a motion to approve the main paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16950.183s">[Bears]</a>: Is there a second by Councilor Tseng?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16951.944s">[Bears]</a>: A second by Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16952.865s">[Bears]</a>: I will go to Chief of Staff Nazarian, and then I will go to Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16956.567s">[Bears]</a>: Madam Chief of Staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17147.283s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam Chair and staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17285.35s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17285.99s">[Bears]</a>: Any other questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17287.331s">[Bears]</a>: We probably should divide the question on the main paper I have to go to Councilor Callahan, Councilor Callahan my apologies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17352.195s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Kelly and Councilor, Chief of Staff Nazarian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17443.576s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam Chief of Staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17447.218s">[Bears]</a>: Any further questions or comments on the creation of these stabilization funds and the appropriation of free cash funds to them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17500.643s">[Bears]</a>: But about in April 22 is 40%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17502.164s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17502.424s">[Bears]</a>: And that includes towns of 100 and your tollens and your Florida's and your, I suspect, but yes, all 351 cities and towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17515.795s">[Bears]</a>: Any further questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17516.496s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Calhoun?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17522.461s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17523.834s">[Bears]</a>: All right, we'll take the B paper first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17526.115s">[Bears]</a>: On the B paper by Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Tseng, Madam Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17533.596s">[Bears]</a>: And there will probably be four votes on this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17541.498s">[Bears]</a>: Sorry, yes, the re-paper motion, Councilor Callahan, is that we hold a committee of the whole with the administration to discuss and review the draft free cash plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17585.925s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, 60 from everyone absent the motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17590.188s">[Bears]</a>: And then we have the a paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17591.729s">[Bears]</a>: Is there a request to divide I think we should divide this into three votes, but I can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17596.492s">[Bears]</a>: I guess I could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17598.193s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Tseng is requested divided into three votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17600.695s">[Bears]</a>: So the first vote would be to appropriate $6 million in free cash to the General Stabilization Fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17609.702s">[Bears]</a>: On that motion by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Tseng, Madam Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17622.089s">[Bears]</a>: This is six million to the General Stabilization Fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17650.578s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17650.678s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor San Buenaventura?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17793.081s">[Bears]</a>: They just have simply been appropriated to accounts where the city can access them during the period between the start of the next fiscal year and when free cash and retained earnings are certified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18057.115s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, and just from some discussions that I've had, my understanding is one of those areas would be facilities maintenance planning, which we have a need for and issues with across the city historically for decades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18071.622s">[Bears]</a>: And so that's something I have heard talked about, but hopefully further discussion would be happening on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18079.656s">[Bears]</a>: All right, Councilor Callahan, I see your hand raised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18229.594s">[Bears]</a>: go for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18238.182s">[Bears]</a>: The total amount here is, well there's no total at the bottom of this, but essentially these are end-of-year transfers from one account to another account to address minor deficits in those accounts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18251.093s">[Bears]</a>: Madam Chief of Staff or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18255.726s">[Bears]</a>: The only very large ones, there's facilities expenses, 200,000 coming from some other sources, workers' comp 200,000 coming from some other sources, and insurance expenses of one million coming from other sources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18269.559s">[Bears]</a>: I believe we have discussed prior to this that the insurance expenses were higher than expected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18274.444s">[Bears]</a>: With that, I will go to the Chief of Staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18331.252s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion of Vice President Collins to approve, seconded by Councilor Leming, I just wanted to ask one question, Madam Chief of Staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18337.698s">[Bears]</a>: My understanding is that from the budget passed for fiscal 25 on June 11th, that the facilities budget for utilities, workers comp, and health insurance were increased given the actuals estimates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18351.049s">[Bears]</a>: That's why those were higher, part of the reason those were higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18366.229s">[Bears]</a>: Well, at least we will be able to do that before free cash is certified next year, because we have a stabilization fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18375.899s">[Bears]</a>: All right, on the motion of Vice President Collins to approve, seconded by Councilor Leming, to approve the fiscal year 24 end of year transfers, 24-433.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18384.805s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, and it looks like we do have Councilor Callahan back, so we'll try that again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18392.67s">[Bears]</a>: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18399.094s">[Bears]</a>: We heard you loud and clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18476.255s">[Bears]</a>: such as a mix of 0% and 1% increases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18478.576s">[Bears]</a>: Suggested increases would be 1,120, 0%, 1,121, 1%, 1,122, 1%, 1,123, 1%, 1,124, 0%, 7,124, 1%,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18492.183s">[Bears]</a>: there'll be a total of a 4% increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18495.185s">[Bears]</a>: There has been no increase to the salary for the position of mayor since 7-1-2014 for 10 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18566.969s">[Bears]</a>: So let's take these in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18568.49s">[Bears]</a>: First, we have Amendment A, non-union personnel, effective January 1, an increase of 1% to the base salary, effective July 1, an increase of 2% to the base salary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18578.958s">[Bears]</a>: The mayor has requested that the mayor's position be excluded and that some other amount other than those two amounts be included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18586.735s">[Bears]</a>: I'll go to Vice President Collins, Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18590.178s">[Bears]</a>: Actually, could we get a presentation from the Chief of Staff before questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18593.562s">[Bears]</a>: Madam Chief of Staff, Councilor Collins, Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18605.936s">[Bears]</a>: Could we take them one at a time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18607.097s">[Bears]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18717.904s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18772.745s">[Bears]</a>: I will call on you when it is my time to call on you and you will wait until I do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18778.183s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro, after I just reviewed the motion, there's a motion on the floor from Vice President Collins to approve Amendment A while excluding CAF 22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18787.93s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President, sorry, Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18808.348s">[Bears]</a>: So are you excluding, I'm confused by what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18814.053s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, everything below the 2% bullet point is not part of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18830.586s">[Bears]</a>: This amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18835.017s">[Bears]</a>: would not be applied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18837.238s">[Bears]</a>: All of this amendment does is proposes non-union personnel to get 1% on January 1, 2024 and 2% on July 1, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18845.021s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18845.901s">[Bears]</a>: And then the mayor has asked if we want to include some amount for the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18849.422s">[Bears]</a>: If we exclude CAF 22, then they're excluded from those two races.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18854.484s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=662.753s">[Bears]</a>: Motions, orders, and resolutions 24441 offered by Councilor Scarpelli, whereas the Mayor and Medford City Council have repeatedly stated their goal to ensure the highest degree of transparency and accountability in all governmental matters, and whereas on June 28, 2024, Medford City Councilor George Scarpelli sent a letter<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=678.36s">[Bears]</a>: to the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the State Auditor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=689.795s">[Bears]</a>: And whereas, in light of the long-term absence of an appointed city solicitor in the city of Medford and the fact that the city's private legal counsel is a law firm hired by the mayor, and whereas the director of operations of the office of the state auditor responded to Councilor Scarpelli's letter, that the state auditor would, quote, examine the issues raised in the letter if the examination of these issues had the approval of a majority vote of the city council and the mayor, as required by state statute, and whereas the fairest and most objective fashion to resolve the issues raised in Councilor Scarpelli's letter is to have an outside agency address these issues,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=719.878s">[Bears]</a>: and determine the most appropriate way to address these issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2097.032s">[Bears]</a>: Again, again, again, I'll leave it at this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2267.868s">[Bears]</a>: Number one, if you can share the correspondence with your fellow Councilors that you've been having, that would be helpful for us to understand the impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2275.235s">[Bears]</a>: I did, you got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2276.336s">[Bears]</a>: No, you didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2279.759s">[Bears]</a>: You got the letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2302.194s">[Bears]</a>: So we haven't had a chance to review it before the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2311.22s">[Bears]</a>: Let's outline here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2312.461s">[Bears]</a>: Let's outline here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2314.102s">[Bears]</a>: Before I open my mouth, let me start off with number one, I'm going to lose inside a lot of votes in this chamber.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2320.6s">[Bears]</a>: In any case, what happened here, number one, there was a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2323.542s">[Bears]</a>: Rule 21 was invoked on a Councilor Scarpelli paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2346.494s">[Bears]</a>: which moved it to another week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2347.98s">[Bears]</a>: I believe Councilor Scaparro then withdrew the paper without any discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2351.44s">[Bears]</a>: So when we talk about being stymied from discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2353.36s">[Bears]</a>: Point of personal privilege.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2380.706s">[Bears]</a>: We were stymied from discussing that and it was withdrawn unilaterally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2384.208s">[Bears]</a>: This council voted in an open and transparent session, and I have spoken to legal counsel about this, to suspend the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2392.211s">[Bears]</a>: That happened at the first time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2393.351s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scott probably asked many questions on the items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2396.353s">[Bears]</a>: He was not stymied from asking those questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2398.313s">[Bears]</a>: They were discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2399.923s">[Bears]</a>: The only thing that changed is that it couldn't have been postponed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2402.145s">[Bears]</a>: That was the June 11th meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2404.307s">[Bears]</a>: At the June 25th meeting, the rules were again suspended to avoid postponement to beyond the fiscal year deadline, at which point there couldn't have been action taken and the free cash would not have been able to be accessed, putting the city in financial peril.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2420.04s">[Bears]</a>: In any case, rules were suspended in an open and transparent session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2425.623s">[Bears]</a>: There was a motion, there was an invocation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2427.825s">[Bears]</a>: I ruled, there was a vote of the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2430.606s">[Bears]</a>: The council made a vote that was taken in an open session and then moved forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2436.19s">[Bears]</a>: At that point, council, at that point, Councilor Scarpellioli left the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2440.892s">[Bears]</a>: So when we talk about not having our voice heard, you have to be present in the room to ask the questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2927.691s">[Bears]</a>: I'm gonna keep talking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3069.15s">[Bears]</a>: It's the reserve fund, actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3183.606s">[Bears]</a>: We can take a recess if we're going to continue to have anti-democratic disruptions of this public meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3191.471s">[Bears]</a>: It's not, actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3192.492s">[Bears]</a>: As the chair, we need to have a respectful decorum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3196.355s">[Bears]</a>: I'm moving a five minute recess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3466.681s">[Bears]</a>: That was our first actually five-minute recess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3469.325s">[Bears]</a>: We are not going to entertain further disruptions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3472.529s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins, you have the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3478.998s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3481.982s">[Bears]</a>: You done, Vice President Collins?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3483.786s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3905.251s">[Bears]</a>: I'm not going to relitigate it, and I respect what you just said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3915.302s">[Bears]</a>: There's some stuff that happened in summer 2020 that I felt similarly aggrieved by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3919.064s">[Bears]</a>: I didn't write a letter about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3922.746s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4187.448s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4188.329s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4476.621s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4477.262s">[Bears]</a>: I wish that everyone would respect the councilor's right to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4831.707s">[Bears]</a>: Any further comments by members of the council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4890.062s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins, and then I think we should stop the back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5025.746s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just going to add some informative stuff for folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5029.629s">[Bears]</a>: If anyone would like to look at them, as Councilor Scarpelli noted, the meetings of June 11th and June 25th are available on YouTube and MedfordTV.org, along with, I think, the seven Committee of the Wholes on the budget that we had prior to those meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5043.8s">[Bears]</a>: A lot of the things that folks are saying as questions, there are answers in those meetings, and I encourage you to watch them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5050.645s">[Bears]</a>: There were a lot of answers presented over the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5053.107s">[Bears]</a>: most robust budget process that this council has undertaken in decades and the answers are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5058.81s">[Bears]</a>: There's also answers on the free cash questions and a memorandum attached to the June 25th letter and that were discussed at the June 25th meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5066.693s">[Bears]</a>: So if you do have questions or concerns, there's a lot of information out there and we've made it a real point of this council to put as much information about the budget as possible, the situation that we're in, and quite frankly, the reason that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5081.5s">[Bears]</a>: If we had appropriated free cash now, the cliff that I talk about happening, if an override doesn't pass, is a cliff that happens next June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5089.867s">[Bears]</a>: It just postpones the problem that has been very clear from all the budget meetings that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5094.691s">[Bears]</a>: We have to call the question of, are we going to invest in the city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5098.134s">[Bears]</a>: And that's the question that's been called.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5100.516s">[Bears]</a>: The free cash reserves, as noted, we are going to have a committee of the whole meeting to discuss the free cash plan outlined in the June 25th memo, or the memo from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5110.464s">[Bears]</a>: June 21st, that was on the June 25th agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5114.207s">[Bears]</a>: And I really encourage people to, as Councilor Scarpelli said, watch those meetings, read the materials attached to those meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5120.851s">[Bears]</a>: You will find very helpful and informative answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5124.554s">[Bears]</a>: With that, are there any members of the public who would like to speak on this resolution?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5136.202s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5137.183s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes and we'll alternate between the podium and Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5327.837s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5328.197s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Donna on zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5330.259s">[Bears]</a>: Donna, they have an address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5344.589s">[Bears]</a>: All right, then we will go to Eileen on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5348.21s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5349.451s">[Bears]</a>: Eileen, you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5370.153s">[Bears]</a>: All right, is there anyone in the chamber or on Zoom who would like to comment on this paper?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5378.861s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5384.726s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5448.866s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5449.586s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to go to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5450.927s">[Bears]</a>: Jessica, can you hear me on Zoom?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5452.047s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to ask for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5454.368s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5494.936s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5497.939s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone else in the room who would like to speak, please come to the podium, name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5501.262s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5516.557s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5560.607s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5560.947s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, state law requires all municipalities to have an annual audit, and it is an independent audit done by someone outside the city, and it is published when completed on the city website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5572.836s">[Bears]</a>: Any further comment by members of the public?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5576.018s">[Bears]</a>: I'm gonna go to try Donna on Zoom again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5578.0s">[Bears]</a>: Donna, I'm gonna try you again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5579.801s">[Bears]</a>: I'm asking you to unmute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5582.003s">[Bears]</a>: Hello, can you hear me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5587.067s">[Bears]</a>: Please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5589.602s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, please provide your name and address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5715.41s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5724.329s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record please, you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5782.428s">[Bears]</a>: That station's not a part of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5819.521s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think privatizing the parking was a good idea 10 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5822.544s">[Bears]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5861.82s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5862.3s">[Bears]</a>: I think Councilor Scarpelli, anyone's beating on Councilor Scarpelli, nor do I think he would allow it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5868.524s">[Bears]</a>: But I will say that I think everyone behind this rail believes that we are doing our best diligently to dig out of a very significant hole, and that has been put in place over many decades, and that we are working to address that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5881.453s">[Bears]</a>: So that's what the proposals and the discussions we've had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5884.475s">[Bears]</a>: That's what the updated budget process that we've been put in place is about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5888.999s">[Bears]</a>: That's what the assessments of capital needs are about, and that is why we are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5894.122s">[Bears]</a>: putting more information out than ever before through a much longer process about the budget than has ever happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5898.687s">[Bears]</a>: So that was a priority of me since day one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5901.39s">[Bears]</a>: We've made a lot of progress and we're going to continue doing the work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5966.965s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5968.465s">[Bears]</a>: Any further comment by members of the public?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5970.506s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to go to people who haven't spoken first, and then I will come back to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5974.168s">[Bears]</a>: I don't see any hands on Zoom, so go to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5975.948s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5999.418s">[Bears]</a>: It is not accurate to say that we did not know that there was money there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6003.401s">[Bears]</a>: We did not know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6007.764s">[Bears]</a>: The state, the Division of Local Services, part of the Department of Revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6011.087s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, they give money every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6012.128s">[Bears]</a>: No, they actually certify the city's free cash reserve balance every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6016.471s">[Bears]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6016.891s">[Bears]</a>: And they certified that balance in June this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6019.974s">[Bears]</a>: So that is when we got the official certification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6024.017s">[Bears]</a>: I would have to look, but it was probably<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6025.418s">[Bears]</a>: probably between June 15th and 20th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6029.96s">[Bears]</a>: No, it was after the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6035.703s">[Bears]</a>: Well, and the financial team communicated to this council at budget meetings and committee of the whole, that there was going to be a free cash balance this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6045.988s">[Bears]</a>: similar to the previous few years for three major reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6049.329s">[Bears]</a>: The use of federal funds, ARPA funding from the federal government, one-time funds, in the place where free cash reserves may have otherwise been used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6063.212s">[Bears]</a>: That was a certification, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6064.352s">[Bears]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6072.914s">[Bears]</a>: It was a one-time surplus and is not reliably budgetable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6082.355s">[Bears]</a>: We don't know how much is coming until it's certified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6084.376s">[Bears]</a>: And the financial experts on our finance team have said that we should not expect to have free cash balances of $9 million going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6095.224s">[Bears]</a>: It would be much more that what they have said in multiple meetings that we've had in this chamber is that we should expect, similar to what was under Mayor McGlynn and Mayor Burke, between $500,000 and $2 million free cash balance surpluses certified at the end of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6143.814s">[Bears]</a>: Can we further comment by members of the public?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6149.317s">[Bears]</a>: I don't see any hands on Zoom, so we'll take you at the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6151.278s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6232.853s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6236.86s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone else who'd like to speak, either in person or on Zoom?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6239.783s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing no hands on Zoom, I will go to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6241.766s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6242.927s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6263.998s">[Bears]</a>: The mayor's paper to give all non-union employees a raise was passed for first reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6274.042s">[Bears]</a>: I believe all non-union employees fall under it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6276.423s">[Bears]</a>: So that would be you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6277.564s">[Bears]</a>: I believe so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6292.97s">[Bears]</a>: She did not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6300.076s">[Bears]</a>: No, she recommended an alternative payment schedule that actually would have resulted in increased compensation, including retroactive pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6310.017s">[Bears]</a>: So if you could read the paper, it was a suggestion, and that suggestion was not accepted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6318.86s">[Bears]</a>: Well, the text of the paper explicitly says she was not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2474.356s">[Bears]</a>: Do we also want to add in that the petitioner noted hosting a community day?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2477.977s">[Bears]</a>: I think that's a great thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3000.066s">[Bears]</a>: 24-467 offered by mayor Breanna Lungo-Koehn, Capital Stabilization Fund appropriation requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3006.37s">[Bears]</a>: September 12 2024 regarding Capital Stabilization Fund appropriation request dear President Bears and members of the city council I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approves the following two appropriations from the Capital Stabilization Fund Spring Street at Central Avenue traffic signal safety improvement project<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3023.877s">[Bears]</a>: any amount of $283,535 and matching funds for the MAS, Department of Environmental Protection, VW and refuse truck electric grant program to purchase one electric refuse truck in the amount of $178,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3040.561s">[Bears]</a>: As your honorable body knows, the capital stabilization fund presently has a balance of $5 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3046.542s">[Bears]</a>: Further, any appropriation from stabilization account requires a two thirds majority vote of the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3052.537s">[Bears]</a>: Director of Traffic and Transportation, Todd Blake, will be present to answer any questions on the Traffic Safety Improvement Project, and CPA Manager, Teresa DuPont, will be available to present any and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3062.442s">[Bears]</a>: We'll be present to answer any questions on the electric refuse truck project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3065.924s">[Bears]</a>: Finally, I respectfully request that both, or at least the traffic signal safety project, that your Honorable Body move forward tonight as the city is under some tight timelines for award, and Director Blake will elaborate on those at or before the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3077.191s">[Bears]</a>: And we did receive, I'm sorry, thank you for your kind attention to this matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3079.652s">[Bears]</a>: Respectfully submitted, Breanna Lungo-Koehn mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3081.974s">[Bears]</a>: We did receive a communication from Director Blake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3086.356s">[Bears]</a>: He's also here, but I'll read the communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3090.119s">[Bears]</a>: I'm providing the following additional information in anticipation of some possible questions regarding this request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3095.987s">[Bears]</a>: The city's director of traffic and transportation, as well as the city engineer and former city engineer, current DPW commissioner,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3102.247s">[Bears]</a>: Prioritize this project, that is the Central Ave Spring Street traffic signal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3107.79s">[Bears]</a>: Prioritize this project when developing and prioritizing the city's capital project list slash needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3112.533s">[Bears]</a>: The existing traffic signal is substandard, not meeting national and state guidelines for traffic signals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3116.556s">[Bears]</a>: Specifically, it lacks the minimum number of signal heads per approach to only having one per approach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3122.199s">[Bears]</a>: The traffic signal also lacks pedestrian actuation and indications, walk slash don't walk indications, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3127.942s">[Bears]</a>: This project is necessary to add these important safety features as well as to provide accessible ramps<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3132.423s">[Bears]</a>: so the accommodations are available to all persons of all abilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3135.884s">[Bears]</a>: The city hired a consultant to design the project, which includes an overhead mast arm for better visibility and to achieve the two signals per approach standard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3143.407s">[Bears]</a>: The city secured allocated funding using CityARPA to design and construct the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3147.765s">[Bears]</a>: The amount sought through that program accounted for paying the consultant as well as paying for the construction of the project based on the construction cost estimate produced by that design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3155.29s">[Bears]</a>: During the bidding process, the city received three qualified bids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3158.192s">[Bears]</a>: However, unfortunately, all three bids are higher than the estimated construction costs, substantially higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3163.916s">[Bears]</a>: Therefore, the project requires additional funding to be able to award a contract and proceed with construction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3168.68s">[Bears]</a>: The city project is seeking $283,535 from the capital stabilization fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3175.199s">[Bears]</a>: For context, the total construction cost is $749,535 based on the low bid plus estimated police details.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3183.325s">[Bears]</a>: The construction estimate had been $466,135.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3186.446s">[Bears]</a>: The design fees are $141,900.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3191.027s">[Bears]</a>: We do not anticipate receiving lower bids if rebidding the project, and there do not appear to be cost savings from value engineering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3196.449s">[Bears]</a>: It is already minimum work required.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3198.609s">[Bears]</a>: There are multiple time constraints involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3200.63s">[Bears]</a>: Since it is ARPA funded, the funds need to be allocated by the end of the calendar year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3204.271s">[Bears]</a>: Also, the contract must be awarded within 45 days of the bid opening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3207.592s">[Bears]</a>: Because of these time constraints, we also not only ask for the funds, but we request approval be given tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3212.352s">[Bears]</a>: without continuing to subsequent meetings, this will help ensure the award within the proper time constraint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3217.074s">[Bears]</a>: If we do not move forward or miss our window of opportunity to construct this project, safety will remain compromised at this location, possibly leading to incidents and or claims that could be avoided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3225.799s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you for your time and consideration on this important matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3228.5s">[Bears]</a>: Sincerely, Todd Blake, Director of Traffic and Transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3231.021s">[Bears]</a>: So that's the letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3235.143s">[Bears]</a>: Any comments, questions, thoughts by members of the council or questions for Director Blake or Manager DuPont?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3242.978s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3255.983s">[Bears]</a>: That was an error.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3257.063s">[Bears]</a>: So that's an error in the letter for the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3258.744s">[Bears]</a>: It's an appropriation request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3260.524s">[Bears]</a>: So, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3278.996s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Kaya and Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3349.773s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3350.914s">[Bears]</a>: And I want to note that the mayor has reached out to schedule a committee of the whole in October to discuss stabilization fund requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3361.28s">[Bears]</a>: Now that ARPA funding is expiring, we're coming back to why free cash exists and exists for these one-time expenditures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3369.906s">[Bears]</a>: So the mayor, I'm working with the mayor to schedule a committee of the whole on an October Wednesday to discuss<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3374.889s">[Bears]</a>: for the capital stabilization fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3375.63s">[Bears]</a>: And then we have the needs for departments from the stabilization funds, I think, mainly starting with the capital stabilization fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3381.115s">[Bears]</a>: These two items were urgent, and that's why they're before us tonight, and the mayor communicated that to me, in addition to this letter as well, in the note that most of the other stuff will be coming to us through a committee process for review<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3401.627s">[Bears]</a>: And I just think Spring Street and Central Ave, that's a rough intersection if anyone's ever been walking through it or driving through it or biking through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3408.611s">[Bears]</a>: And hopefully between this project and the speed humps, we'll see some safety improvements there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3414.695s">[Bears]</a>: Any further questions or discussion by members of the Council on this paper?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3417.776s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3793.684s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3794.725s">[Bears]</a>: Any further comments by members of the Council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3796.546s">[Bears]</a>: I see Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4061.033s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4089.596s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion of Vice President Collins to approve, seconded by Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4163.72s">[Bears]</a>: seconded by councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4164.641s">[Bears]</a>: I just want to note two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4166.542s">[Bears]</a>: Free cash to the balance is no longer 34 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4168.985s">[Bears]</a>: There were at least $11 million in appropriations on June 25th to these stabilization funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4175.49s">[Bears]</a>: And the request before us tonight are appropriations from the capital stabilization fund, which is for capital purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4181.095s">[Bears]</a>: So that's what these funds can be used for at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4185.999s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion to sever the two papers by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4191.504s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4207.497s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4211.781s">[Bears]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4213.834s">[Bears]</a>: Finally, if there were two in the negative, the motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4215.875s">[Bears]</a>: I just want to note now that this is severed, change my vote to yes, because I might need the Councilor to take this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4225.701s">[Bears]</a>: There's matching funds for a grant here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4227.682s">[Bears]</a>: So I'd like to hear from Director DuPont about what a delay would mean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4236.988s">[Bears]</a>: Sorry, manager.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4237.688s">[Bears]</a>: No, no, I love it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4239.39s">[Bears]</a>: I have literally no authority to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4240.991s">[Bears]</a>: It's all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4347.873s">[Bears]</a>: What would a delay mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4381.277s">[Bears]</a>: So we need it in eight months and we have eight months of work to do to get this done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4384.382s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, it might not be eight months, but maybe close to six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4387.627s">[Bears]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4387.988s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4389.23s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4439.361s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion by Councilor Collins to reconsider the vote on the motion to sever, seconded by Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4444.745s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4448.127s">[Bears]</a>: Just to clarify, in the motion to reconsider, a yes vote would mean that we will then take another vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4453.471s">[Bears]</a>: So if you want to consider this question of severing again, you will vote yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4461.977s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4471.662s">[Bears]</a>: You're voting separately, but also motions can be made on them separately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4479.708s">[Bears]</a>: You have a question, Councilor Callahan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4488.436s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, this is a vote on do we want to reconsider severing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4491.698s">[Bears]</a>: Because Councilor Collins was in the majority on the vote to sever, Councilor Collins can make a motion to reconsider that vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4500.405s">[Bears]</a>: If we vote yes to reconsider, we would then take another vote on the motion to sever or have further discussion on the motion to sever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4507.191s">[Bears]</a>: Essentially, it brings us back to discussion on the motion to sever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4509.733s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4511.485s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion to reconsider by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4515.667s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4533.057s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4533.357s">[Bears]</a>: Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4534.658s">[Bears]</a>: The motion to reconsider passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4536.338s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion to sever by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Callahan, is there further discussion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4546.764s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll on the motion to sever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4557.351s">[Bears]</a>: I know we're using up those vote slips.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4585.688s">[Bears]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4588.45s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4592.953s">[Bears]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4593.253s">[Bears]</a>: Five in the negative, two in the affirmative, the motion to sever fails.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4597.176s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion on the paper before us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4600.478s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4607.748s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion of Vice President Collins to approve the appropriation request, seconded by Councilor Leming, is appropriation from the Capital Stabilization Fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4615.554s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion by members of the Council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4620.217s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, we'll go to members of the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4622.338s">[Bears]</a>: We will go to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4624.86s">[Bears]</a>: Gaston, name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4626.381s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4672.701s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to go to Director DuPont on this in a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4674.983s">[Bears]</a>: It sounded like she said, Manager DuPont, I keep promoting you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4679.986s">[Bears]</a>: But it sounded like you said sourcing would take 60 to 90 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4682.568s">[Bears]</a>: That includes a procurement process, if I'm correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4685.45s">[Bears]</a>: Part of the chapter, I can't remember the chapter, but the procurement law is 30B.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4690.154s">[Bears]</a>: The chapter procurement laws is that you have to have a defined source of the funds before you can go out to procurement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4695.208s">[Bears]</a>: So I think that's what the issue is here that they have to have the funds approved, then go to procurement to get the vehicle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4701.439s">[Bears]</a>: And they're just you're matching the grant amount that was authorized by DEP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4704.684s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4705.986s">[Bears]</a>: I think that's the answer there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4725.888s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4726.368s">[Bears]</a>: The bidding is after the funding is authorized, and if the bid comes in lower than the authorized funding, then I believe that money would revert back to the source of funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4738.564s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4738.824s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4739.424s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4739.884s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4740.785s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4742.945s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion by members of the public or members of the council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4748.587s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4755.47s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4757.95s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion of Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Leming to approve, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4762.192s">[Bears]</a>: Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4784.002s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4785.563s">[Bears]</a>: Public participation is open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4789.425s">[Bears]</a>: If you can raise your hand on Zoom or go to the podium, I do have two letters to read, but I will read those after public participation by people who are either in the room or on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4809.178s">[Bears]</a>: Any public participation by anyone in the chamber or on Zoom?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4813.462s">[Bears]</a>: Please raise your hand on Zoom or speak up in the chamber.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4819.427s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, I have two letters to read.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4821.488s">[Bears]</a>: These were sent to me by constituents, sent to the president and requested to be read at the council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4827.453s">[Bears]</a>: These are not reflective of, these are not statements by me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4830.596s">[Bears]</a>: I am reading letters from the public for public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4835.316s">[Bears]</a>: Dear councilors, I have witnessed the appalling personal attacks against our progressive city councils by people incorrectly calling themselves All Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4842.122s">[Bears]</a>: They have screamed, interrupted, kept people from speaking, and ignored honest answers to their concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4846.385s">[Bears]</a>: Meetings have dragged on to 1 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4848.427s">[Bears]</a>: Our new city councilors are sincere, thoughtful people trying to make Medford a better place for all, with more affordable housing, an end to discrimination, and enough funding to support our underfunded public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4858.415s">[Bears]</a>: One needn't agree with them on everything, but disrespectful conduct keeps our city from moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4862.498s">[Bears]</a>: I have lived in Medford for 43 years,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4864.56s">[Bears]</a>: and sadly will be departing soon for senior housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4866.722s">[Bears]</a>: I can honestly attest that Medford is a better place now, with better schools, more diversity, a brand new police station, interesting new restaurants, and potentially a new fire station than it was when I first came here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4876.53s">[Bears]</a>: The effort to overturn the regressive Proposition 2.5, which has resulted in underfunding our schools and roads, is a positive thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4882.635s">[Bears]</a>: Of course, in the end, it will be put to the voters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4884.576s">[Bears]</a>: I do understand that this may pose a small hardship for low-income homeowners, but most cities and towns have already passed overrides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4890.119s">[Bears]</a>: People can, of course, vote against it, but they should not attack those who, in good faith, want to improve our city with essential funding by putting it on the ballot or misrepresent their views, as was done in heated discussions of the real estate transfer fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4900.845s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4901.225s">[Bears]</a>: Susan Gerard, Medford, Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4905.347s">[Bears]</a>: That's the first letter, and then I have another letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4908.223s">[Bears]</a>: Dear Medford City Council President Zach Bares, I request you read this letter at the next City Council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4913.109s">[Bears]</a>: This past year, I've attended many City Council meetings, mostly on Zoom, a few in City Hall chambers, largely because of closed captioning, which allows me to hear more of what people in the chambers are saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4922.12s">[Bears]</a>: The deficient sound system in City Hall, I understand, is going to be renovated, and that will be good for everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4927.068s">[Bears]</a>: A second reason I have often preferred not to be physically present in the City Council Chambers is because of an unruly mob of residents who come to meetings to register their displeasure on hot-button issues like the budget, real estate transfer fee, or renaming of the Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4940.578s">[Bears]</a>: These meetings have been perforated by the group ironically now known as All Medford, the small group of residents regularly indulging, screaming, shouting, and insulting our Revolution Medford-endorsed City Councilors,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4951.226s">[Bears]</a>: After one particularly contentious meeting I attended in City Hall, councillors were individually singled out for repeated personal attacks and subjected to blanket attacks on all of them because they belonged to our revolution, Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4961.897s">[Bears]</a>: I was so disturbed by the vitriol, the lies, the hatred, and the unwillingness to even listen to what Councilors had to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4967.278s">[Bears]</a>: I'm so sorry that you, Zach, and the other OR-endorsed Councilors have been subjected to this abuse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4972.639s">[Bears]</a>: I want to assure you that a majority of residents who voted for you and all our Revolution Medford candidates still support the work you've been doing or attempting to do in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4980.941s">[Bears]</a>: Know that we are still here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4982.201s">[Bears]</a>: All Medford is not all Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4984.222s">[Bears]</a>: You were elected on the basis of the People's Platform, and we who voted for you still want to work on that agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4990.923s">[Bears]</a>: the city budget we need to support the schools and city services, the creation of an equitable and welcoming city government, desperately needed affordable housing, community safety, and a climate-resilient community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=5001.553s">[Bears]</a>: As we explore solutions to these and other issues, I support you, as do the many who voted for our Revolution Medford candidates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=5007.178s">[Bears]</a>: Please do not allow the not-all Medford to derail or curtail any of your intentions, goals, or efforts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=5012.602s">[Bears]</a>: We who support you are many.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=5014.104s">[Bears]</a>: There are a small group of disgruntled people whose leadership and control has been rejected by the voters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=5017.927s">[Bears]</a>: voters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=5018.327s">[Bears]</a>: Sincerely, Eileen Lerner, Knight-Adams Circle, Medford, Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=5024.55s">[Bears]</a>: Those are the letters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=5026.111s">[Bears]</a>: Is there anyone else who has any public comment at this time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=5035.356s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, is there anything else that anyone wants to look at on the agenda?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=5046.118s">[Bears]</a>: We're at unfinished business, seeing no motions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=5048.74s">[Bears]</a>: Is there a motion on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=5050.961s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion to adjourn by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=5054.444s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=5070.454s">[Bears]</a>: It looks like he's dropped off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=5074.301s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=5075.763s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=5076.665s">[Bears]</a>: Six in the affirmative, one absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=5078.267s">[Bears]</a>: The motion passes and the meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=5081.553s">[Bears]</a>: I need everyone to stick around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1323.959s">[Bears]</a>: Hi there, sorry about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1325.9s">[Bears]</a>: I am currently sitting at the intersection of Main Street and South Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1331.341s">[Bears]</a>: So subject matter expert at the moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1336.143s">[Bears]</a>: I just wanted to note a thank you, Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1338.824s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you to the Bike Commission and to Emily O'Brien for your work on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1344.565s">[Bears]</a>: And thank you to Todd for being our liaison with MassDOT.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1350.847s">[Bears]</a>: But I also just wanted to note<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1353.089s">[Bears]</a>: I think it's essential that we get this right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1356.19s">[Bears]</a>: Medford wasn't built for the level of car volume that we have now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1362.772s">[Bears]</a>: And just because we pasted an overpass of Route 16 and the highway through it doesn't mean that the rest of our streets can actually handle<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1373.595s">[Bears]</a>: the car volume that we have today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1375.677s">[Bears]</a>: And that's why it's essential that we move in the direction that we're moving to make Medford more accessible for all, not just people with cars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1385.243s">[Bears]</a>: I'm one who uses my car all the time, but I would use other modes of transportation if I felt like I could get where I was going in a reasonable amount of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1395.509s">[Bears]</a>: The Craddock Bridge is the only crossing of the Mystic River for about a mile or more on either side of the east or west.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1406.377s">[Bears]</a>: And we know that it was deeply impacted by the massive volumes of car traffic that have been throughput through that bridge and through the intersections that we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1416.644s">[Bears]</a>: by Interstate 93 and by the overbuilt Route 16 overpass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1421.45s">[Bears]</a>: And I think it's essential that we get this signalization and rebuild of Main and Mystic right, because what we're talking about in Medford Square and what we're talking about on Mystic Ave is returning to a people-centered era, not a car-centered era.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1436.787s">[Bears]</a>: All of the spots on Mystic Ave just south of the bridge and just south of the 16 overpass used to be a vibrant walkable neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1444.794s">[Bears]</a>: Medford Square used to be a vibrant walkable neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1447.957s">[Bears]</a>: The car supremacy and the building of the highway destroyed so much of the community that was built there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1455.044s">[Bears]</a>: And now that we're trying to restore it, this isn't the essential link.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1458.527s">[Bears]</a>: to making it work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1459.508s">[Bears]</a>: So I appreciate the bike commission's work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1462.772s">[Bears]</a>: I appreciate everyone's conversation here in this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1465.575s">[Bears]</a>: I also think putting that layer of what do we want our community to look like and how do we want to make sure that it's safe for everyone to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1475.305s">[Bears]</a>: have community and link together in our squares is an important part of the conversation, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1481.712s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think the 25% design hit that mark, but I'm hopeful that upcoming designs will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1487.438s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1732.663s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=107.472s">[Bears]</a>: Medford City Council, Committee of the Whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=109.813s">[Bears]</a>: October 2nd, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=110.873s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=128.479s">[Bears]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=129.859s">[Bears]</a>: Seven present, none absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=130.819s">[Bears]</a>: Meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=132.24s">[Bears]</a>: Since we're in hybrid mode, we will have all roll call votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=138.515s">[Bears]</a>: 24473 presented by Mayor Brianna Locurn, Capital Stabilization Fund appropriation request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=142.779s">[Bears]</a>: And we have a revised letter from today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=144.781s">[Bears]</a>: Dear President Bears and members of the city council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approves the following appropriations from the Capital Stabilization Fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=154.189s">[Bears]</a>: Replacement of the water heater at Brooks Elementary School, $267,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=156.491s">[Bears]</a>: Roadway patching in the amount of $112,728.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=164.676s">[Bears]</a>: replacement of light poles in city parking lots in the amount of $105,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=169.478s">[Bears]</a>: City Hall elevator repair unforeseen costs and upgrades of electrical and fire alarm systems needed for code compliance, 75,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=176.162s">[Bears]</a>: Repairs at Brooks Estate, use of funds must comply with city procurement policies and procedures and state procurement law in the amount of 55,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=184.146s">[Bears]</a>: As your honorable body knows, the capital stabilization fund currently has a balance of $4,538,465 given the appropriations made<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=193.863s">[Bears]</a>: on September 17th, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=196.145s">[Bears]</a>: If all of the above are approved, the capital stabilization fund would have $3,923,737 that remains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=202.73s">[Bears]</a>: Any appropriation from the stabilization account requires a two-thirds majority vote of the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=207.834s">[Bears]</a>: At the City Council's Committee of the Whole meeting on Wednesday, October 2nd, Assistant Superintendent Peter Cushing will be available for questions on the water heater replacement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=215.054s">[Bears]</a>: City Engineer Owen Wartella will be here for the roadway and patching project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=219.357s">[Bears]</a>: Superintendent of Ours, Steven Randazzo on the light poles and Facilities Director Paul Riggi on the elevator project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=225.381s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=226.882s">[Bears]</a>: Respectfully submitted, Breanna Lungo-Koehn, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=230.844s">[Bears]</a>: And we will not be talking about the engine three pump right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=234.387s">[Bears]</a>: That's looking like they're going to need to reassess the project and the cost for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=239.11s">[Bears]</a>: So that is not on the table right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=242.366s">[Bears]</a>: given where we're at, just wanted to see if anyone had any questions before we move into discussion of individual items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=251.134s">[Bears]</a>: I see Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=266.946s">[Bears]</a>: I don't see the chief of staff or the mayor present, but Director Riggi is gonna go check in that office right now and see if they can pop over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=342.135s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=343.496s">[Bears]</a>: Any other questions or comments by members of the Council before we move into the specific items?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=351.041s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, while we wait for Director Riggi to return, we'll start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=356.208s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=356.849s">[Bears]</a>: We'll start with the water heater at the Brooks School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=358.631s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Assistant Superintendent Cushing, if you could give us a little information on the project and see if we have any questions from members of the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=480.52s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=481.5s">[Bears]</a>: Any questions for Superintendent Cushing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=489.743s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, I have one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=490.683s">[Bears]</a>: Oh, Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=507.269s">[Bears]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=507.769s">[Bears]</a>: I have two questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=509.07s">[Bears]</a>: One was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=510.427s">[Bears]</a>: What did the, you know, we're looking at 267,000 here for this system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=515.391s">[Bears]</a>: What did the all electric system, what were the estimates coming in for that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=575.304s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=576.945s">[Bears]</a>: And it sounds like we were able to make the initial water heaters last 20 years or so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=629.153s">[Bears]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=629.993s">[Bears]</a>: Council Desiro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=651.634s">[Bears]</a>: Before we go to bid, we have to authorize funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=654.754s">[Bears]</a>: So the authorization is based on the estimate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=663.956s">[Bears]</a>: I think if the bid comes in under the appropriated amount, then the balance reverts to the fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=668.457s">[Bears]</a>: This is the most it could cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=670.37s">[Bears]</a>: Well, this is the, I mean, unless the bids come in higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=673.252s">[Bears]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=673.753s">[Bears]</a>: So this is what I think the best estimate for authorization and then the bidding process will determine the final cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=679.878s">[Bears]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=757.117s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=837.573s">[Bears]</a>: From what Mr. Cushing said, the hot water heaters and all the other new buildings that early 2000s buildings have already been replaced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=848.137s">[Bears]</a>: But the HVAC systems and Mr. Director, if you want to come up and say anything about the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=853.052s">[Bears]</a>: general condition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=853.692s">[Bears]</a>: I know we've talked a lot about the middle schools, HVAC being a significant investment that's needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=951.985s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=952.826s">[Bears]</a>: Any further questions on this item?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=954.467s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1029.309s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1029.829s">[Bears]</a>: I think we'll see where we are at the end of the presentations and hopefully we can refer items out to the regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1036.835s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing no further questions, Mr. Superintendent, thank you for answering them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1040.478s">[Bears]</a>: We'll move to the next item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1042.8s">[Bears]</a>: Next item is roadway patching in the amount of $112,728.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1044.962s">[Bears]</a>: And that I believe is our city engineer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1100.993s">[Bears]</a>: Any questions for City Engineer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1105.338s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Kelly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1163.542s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1164.923s">[Bears]</a>: Any other questions on the roadway patching?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1170.045s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, I have one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1172.206s">[Bears]</a>: When we say that the square yard cost went up $10 a square yard, what is that from and what is that to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1195.362s">[Bears]</a>: All right Do you have any understanding as to why that's happening or I think asphalt is expensive I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1218.601s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1218.841s">[Bears]</a>: I just didn't know if there was any specific supply chain stuff that you might know about that we might not know about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1223.083s">[Bears]</a>: Um, but I will just note that, uh, 10, you know, the percentage change there is huge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1229.185s">[Bears]</a>: It's almost 25% higher than we thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1230.326s">[Bears]</a>: And 25 is a lot more than 2.5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1241.926s">[Bears]</a>: All right, any other questions regarding roadway patching?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1247.027s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, I will go to the next item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1249.588s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Randazzo, replacement of light poles in the city parking lots in the amount of $105,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1252.989s">[Bears]</a>: What do we got, Steve?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1334.506s">[Bears]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1335.566s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1482.701s">[Bears]</a>: I had one question just when the poll came down, what was the, did it hit anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1488.688s">[Bears]</a>: What was the impact of it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1515.162s">[Bears]</a>: All right, and was it on a sidewalk, parking lot, roadway?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1523.106s">[Bears]</a>: Okay, all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1525.507s">[Bears]</a>: And I know you weren't around, did it happen late at night or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1529.829s">[Bears]</a>: You don't know, yeah, it's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1531.951s">[Bears]</a>: Just obviously wanna not have light poles falling on cars or people or anything else, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1563.782s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1564.743s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1566.556s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing no further questions, we'll move to our next item, which is the elevator repair unforeseen costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1572.726s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Director Riggi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1766.82s">[Bears]</a>: Is it Brooks Estate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1768.582s">[Bears]</a>: Brooks Estate, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1769.903s">[Bears]</a>: I'm familiar with this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1771.225s">[Bears]</a>: We do have our Brooks Estate president, Carly Nessen here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1776.891s">[Bears]</a>: Welcome, Carly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1777.752s">[Bears]</a>: I can go quickly through just to say that this is a request for $55,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1785.42s">[Bears]</a>: for repairs at the Brooks Estate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1788.483s">[Bears]</a>: The breakdown of that, I'm sure Carly can go into more details, but there are some roof repairs and snow repairs and insulation and radiator work that need to happen as well as drywall repairs, walls and ceilings in the caretaker spaces and floors<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1807.136s">[Bears]</a>: in the caretaker spaces as well as some pest control in the attic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1813.359s">[Bears]</a>: And that is important because we are seeking new caretakers at the estate to oversee and watch and keep safe the city property that is the Brooks Estate and the Shepherd Brooks Manor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1826.326s">[Bears]</a>: So with that, I will go to Carly Nessen, president of the Medford Brooks Estate Land Trust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1877.825s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1881.947s">[Bears]</a>: Any questions for President Nesson?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1887.759s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, I see a hand raised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1896.402s">[Bears]</a>: Got it, I'll go to Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1915.841s">[Bears]</a>: I will go to Carly on active projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1917.763s">[Bears]</a>: I think I'll have to unmute you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1920.966s">[Bears]</a>: This is preventative maintenance, so it doesn't fall under CPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1949.714s">[Bears]</a>: Maintenance and emergency repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1955.619s">[Bears]</a>: Great, any other questions regarding the Brooks Estate item, the repairs at the Brooks Estate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1965.006s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, we do have the Chief of Staff, who is, I'm sure, working diligently on another thing right now, and if you need a minute,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1972.79s">[Bears]</a>: I can give you a minute, but Councilor Scarpelli did have a question, I think, potentially related to the fire item that came off the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1988.665s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, if you wanna restate the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2097.554s">[Bears]</a>: you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2097.674s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2098.375s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2098.635s">[Bears]</a>: Chief Stephanie's area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2245.775s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion of council, I'm going to refer the paper with the items to the regular meeting, seconded by Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2250.998s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2254.979s">[Bears]</a>: We have a raised hand for participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2258.381s">[Bears]</a>: Give me one second here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2259.601s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Gaston Fiore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2263.043s">[Bears]</a>: Or Councilor Scarpelli, is that, do you want to go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2328.407s">[Bears]</a>: I'll go to vice president Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2399.54s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2437.61s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2438.03s">[Bears]</a>: Go to public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2439.41s">[Bears]</a>: Gaston Fiore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2441.351s">[Bears]</a>: I will ask you to unmute and you'll have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2443.411s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2583.902s">[Bears]</a>: We had a motion on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2591.208s">[Bears]</a>: Refer out of committee to the regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2593.971s">[Bears]</a>: Seconded by Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2597.173s">[Bears]</a>: We have a little more discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2598.375s">[Bears]</a>: Chief of staff Nazarian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2622.181s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2623.462s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion of Councilor Leming, seconded by Councilor Callahan, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2680.165s">[Bears]</a>: We're in the middle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2684.227s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2689.248s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2689.608s">[Bears]</a>: 70 affirmative, none negative motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2693.49s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2694.53s">[Bears]</a>: We could talk about average new growth plus two and a half percent being around 3.25 to which is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2703.598s">[Bears]</a>: about 20% of 25%, but no one wants to hear me talk about percents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2709.482s">[Bears]</a>: We just don't have enough money to run the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2711.624s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion adjourned by Councilor Lazzaro, seconded by Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2716.087s">[Bears]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2716.247s">[Bears]</a>: Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2753.874s">[Bears]</a>: All right, Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2759.84s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, 60 affirmative, one absent, motion passes, meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=11.0s">[Bears]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=178.713s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=180.775s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Director Hunt, for helping get this refined and out, and now we have, I think, a couple of good submissions back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=191.314s">[Bears]</a>: As one Councilor, I mean, I think there's some significant difference between the two in the sense that one obviously has a significant amount of experience in our area and specifically within the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=203.781s">[Bears]</a>: And I think there's a lot of value there because we won't be, if we were to go with that proposal, we would not have to be kind of educating so much the proponent on or the applicant on our community and the comprehensive plan and the various plans that we're using to inform this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=221.178s">[Bears]</a>: as well as the priorities of the City Council when it comes to zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=227.127s">[Bears]</a>: I do think both proposals are really strong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=229.511s">[Bears]</a>: I don't want to discount that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=231.65s">[Bears]</a>: Uh, for me, um, I do think that working with, you know, attorneys from Bob Prokowski, Haverty and Silverstein working with Emily Ennis, you know, those are folks we've worked with on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=243.479s">[Bears]</a>: Not just the plans, but also the zoning reconification also on a number of specific project base issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=248.403s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, I think they have a really good understanding of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=252.927s">[Bears]</a>: what our priorities are for development, and I think that that is invaluable because I think it means we can hit the ground running really well with that team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=261.255s">[Bears]</a>: That being said, I did appreciate the other proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=265.298s">[Bears]</a>: One thing from the other proposal that I really think I would like to see maybe from the other team, if we go with the other team, I liked this project schedule page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=273.766s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know, that might be too far away to zoom in on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=278.67s">[Bears]</a>: On page 12 of the Fisher proposal, that was just a really helpful schedule to kind of see when we would be working on each.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=288.234s">[Bears]</a>: Each section of what they had proposed for us for this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=291.515s">[Bears]</a>: So, you know, but other than that, I thought the proposals were relatively comparable, except for the fact that 1 really is steeped in the knowledge of what we're looking to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=302.28s">[Bears]</a>: And I think that it would move us to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=305.914s">[Bears]</a>: essentially use the funds we've already put in and the time we've already put in with these folks to our advantage, I think we'll be able to do a lot more with that team, not having to reiterate work that that team essentially has already completed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=320.917s">[Bears]</a>: So that's my read on this, and I'm excited to hear what Director Hunt and my fellow Councilors think about the two proposals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=849.224s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=849.944s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=852.065s">[Bears]</a>: My one question, as it's almost certain that this project will go, you know, 18 months, it'll at least be six months in this fiscal year and 12 months in the next, maybe even a little longer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=865.663s">[Bears]</a>: Did we answer that question with just the amount appropriated in this fiscal year, or we expect also the potentially unexpected appropriation in the upcoming fiscal year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=875.045s">[Bears]</a>: And also, I know there maybe was some money on your side of things that we were maybe going to use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=912.72s">[Bears]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=913.32s">[Bears]</a>: And we're already halfway through this fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=915.321s">[Bears]</a>: So yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=916.542s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=916.923s">[Bears]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=917.303s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=917.903s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1089.671s">[Bears]</a>: So just to understand the process, next step, and I'll make a motion once we've kind of agreed to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1098.154s">[Bears]</a>: is the idea that you want all of us to fill this out and send to you, and then you can say, OK, everybody rank this one more than this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1105.399s">[Bears]</a>: Do you think the president and I should submit one and you should submit one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1109.041s">[Bears]</a>: We could come back next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1113.124s">[Bears]</a>: We could, conceivably, we could report this out to the regular meeting and have it on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1117.947s">[Bears]</a>: If we wanted to make a formal recommendation to you, I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1122.213s">[Bears]</a>: whatever you think is the most procedurally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1184.386s">[Bears]</a>: OK, we need this for the file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1239.243s">[Bears]</a>: It sounds to me like the will of the council is clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1243.404s">[Bears]</a>: I think the motion would be, I think just for procedural sake, and Fiona did mention this to me as well, just we need to have documents in the record if there are questions, you know, that I would make the motion that the president and the vice president work with the director to complete any procedural steps necessary to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1266.212s">[Bears]</a>: to open up the price bids, and then we can make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1272.795s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1300.806s">[Bears]</a>: So motion for the president, vice president, and PDS director to serve as the selection committee and authorization to negotiate based on the price proposals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1317.851s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, yeah, sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1320.952s">[Bears]</a>: Based on the discussion of the council at the December<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1327.04s">[Bears]</a>: 6.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1327.06s">[Bears]</a>: 6, 2023, Committee of the Whole meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1370.702s">[Bears]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1370.922s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I think I'd enter negotiations based on the price proposals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1373.622s">[Bears]</a>: I think on the edit, that would make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1375.263s">[Bears]</a>: Hang on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1375.823s">[Bears]</a>: Let me do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=468.494s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=469.415s">[Bears]</a>: I reviewed the records of the August 15th meeting and I found them in order and I would move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=665.692s">[Bears]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=666.272s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=668.994s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, so basically, we received back comments from the Community Development Board on change A. They did suggest a substantive change, which is to, we had recommended that the, or we had initiated a proposal where the council would be the special permit granting authority for a number of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=688.516s">[Bears]</a>: motor vehicle related uses and miscellaneous commercial uses, specifically in C1, C2 and I districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=694.759s">[Bears]</a>: This is designed to prevent the further proliferation of motor vehicle repair shops and car yards in Mystic Ave area and other commercial areas of the city where we're looking at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=709.356s">[Bears]</a>: other more significant uses than storage or repair of vehicles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=714.678s">[Bears]</a>: So I'll come back to that one, because the CD board recommendation is a significant change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=721.6s">[Bears]</a>: The second change is B, that's on page three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=725.781s">[Bears]</a>: The recodification, that language that we passed had an unintended consequence of making a lot of properties nonconforming, where you have a single parcel with multiple principal structures on the lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=737.485s">[Bears]</a>: The CD board,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=739.619s">[Bears]</a>: did suggest a language change just to specify the districts where that issue is occurring, SF1, SF2, and GR zoning, but otherwise they accepted the proposed change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=752.093s">[Bears]</a>: The third change is adding a second associate member to the Board of Appeals and clarifying term length.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=759.459s">[Bears]</a>: We passed a zoning change in early 2022 that did this, but then we actually overruled it with the recodification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=766.464s">[Bears]</a>: So this is correcting us back to the language that we had passed for members appointments to the Board of Appeals and having a second associate member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=776.872s">[Bears]</a>: There were a number of unintended referrals for papers to the Community Development Board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=781.385s">[Bears]</a>: This is now the fourth one, number D.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=785.857s">[Bears]</a>: of lack of clear language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=787.178s">[Bears]</a>: Basically a lot of these are we've had this new zoning recodification in place for now a little bit over a year, and the bodies that are going through it, the Zoning Board of Appeals and the Community Development Board are saying, here are some of the technical things that we think need to be updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=799.986s">[Bears]</a>: But essentially, we're referring papers to the Community Development Board that never needed to go to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=804.328s">[Bears]</a>: So there's a small technical change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=806.089s">[Bears]</a>: The CDB did not change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=807.49s">[Bears]</a>: Community Development Board recommendations don't change what we had proposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=812.833s">[Bears]</a>: The fifth one is number E,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=816.36s">[Bears]</a>: There was conflict between who is the special permit granting authority, and the Community Development Board recommended specific language to accomplish that objective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=829.548s">[Bears]</a>: Number six, F, the language that we passed in 2022 created an extra requirement for a special permit for inclusionary housing that's not necessary, and the Community Development Board accepted the language changes that we proposed for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=846.59s">[Bears]</a>: G, the state agency that oversees housing changed its name this year from the Department of Housing and Community Development to the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=858.295s">[Bears]</a>: Our proposed change just updates all of those references in the zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=862.216s">[Bears]</a>: I think the CD board may have found one or two more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=868.42s">[Bears]</a>: They slightly changed the language, just to make it more clear, but basically the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=873.542s">[Bears]</a>: And then a number of definitions were deleted from the zoning when we recodified it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=879.144s">[Bears]</a>: Several pages, I think it's pages 10 through, yeah, the whole rest of it, I think, 10 through 21, and the CD board,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=891.095s">[Bears]</a>: agreed with all the ones that we included, and also found a couple other definitions that had been omitted from the recodification to include.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=897.299s">[Bears]</a>: So essentially, that's the summary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=901.002s">[Bears]</a>: If we were to sever, I would recommend severing change A from changes B through G, or sorry, B through H.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1048.02s">[Bears]</a>: I would like to ask that Director Hunt and Planner Evans just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1053.883s">[Bears]</a>: question about the first change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1055.685s">[Bears]</a>: Change A to the use table around motor vehicle related uses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1062.372s">[Bears]</a>: It seems to me that that's the major substance of change in here from the Community Development Board recommendations, which is we had proposed that the council be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1074.6s">[Bears]</a>: the Special Permit Granting Authority for a number of these uses, and the Community Development Board has recommended that they be the Special Permit Granting Authority instead, and I was just wondering if you guys could speak to the Community Development Board's reasoning or rationale behind that recommendation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1302.539s">[Bears]</a>: Is that a further question on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1306.744s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks for that, because I didn't quite notice that, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1309.662s">[Bears]</a>: I'm guessing that's in the J, wholesale transportation, industrial uses, and then it looks like open storage under accessory uses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1316.765s">[Bears]</a>: What was the rationale between, for going to the zoning board for some of them and the city board for others?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1353.113s">[Bears]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1353.754s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I think in general, the intent here was not to allow these kind of uses by right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1359.054s">[Bears]</a>: I like that you at the CD board came back and kind of noted some other specific uses that I think fall into a similar category as what we were looking at with the motor vehicle issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1371.332s">[Bears]</a>: in general, I'd actually, I mean, Councilor Caraviello proposed this, so I'd like to hear from him what he thinks about it being us versus the Community Development Board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1563.239s">[Bears]</a>: Motion to approve pending the six day public comment period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1603.02s">[Bears]</a>: Madam President, motion to suspend the rules to take in the following order papers to two dash four zero one two two dash four zero two two two dash four zero three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1616.493s">[Bears]</a>: 22-395, the petition filed under public participation, 22-400, and 22-405.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1625.578s">[Bears]</a>: Two, three, sorry, I wrote two, two down, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1634.503s">[Bears]</a>: All two, threes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1635.984s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1651.666s">[Bears]</a>: There are a number of people here in the audience with us tonight, who are attending for those various papers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1679.455s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1702.832s">[Bears]</a>: It's on page seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1793.985s">[Bears]</a>: Could we amend the motion to also waive the readings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1799.306s">[Bears]</a>: Just waive the readings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1944.901s">[Bears]</a>: We do have Teresa, our new CPC manager.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1947.482s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know if you want to say anything, Teresa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1958.07s">[Bears]</a>: You just gotta, you gotta press a little.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1959.731s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, there you go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1960.672s">[Bears]</a>: You're good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2176.939s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2178.2s">[Bears]</a>: I put this paper on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2178.94s">[Bears]</a>: There's also a paper on under public participation, which is the next item we're taking up, but maybe we could jointly have the conversation now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2186.862s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know if Elliot wants to come up in a minute,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2190.543s">[Bears]</a>: Just one of the reasons I put this on is that this was something that's been a priority for me since even before I was elected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2197.915s">[Bears]</a>: Short term rentals, you know, certainly have a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2201.864s">[Bears]</a>: limited place, I think, in the housing world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2204.967s">[Bears]</a>: But what we're seeing is a proliferation of a lot of our housing stock being taken up by short-term rentals and being turned into profit centers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2214.094s">[Bears]</a>: And we passed a zoning ordinance last year that put significant restrictions on short-term rentals, required registration, required them to pay a registration fee, and also limited their use, where if there is not an owner-occupant in the unit,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2231.52s">[Bears]</a>: And, you know, if there's an owner occupant renting out rooms, that's one thing, but if there's just a housing unit that's being taken off the long-term rental market and being used for short-term rentals, particularly where you basically have small hotels operating in our neighborhoods, unregulated, we ban that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2249.05s">[Bears]</a>: However, Airbnb and Vrbo have not stopped listing properties that are doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2255.287s">[Bears]</a>: We have had residents like Mr. Jockelson and others who have been reporting, you've probably seen them on various social media sites.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2261.29s">[Bears]</a>: I think there was someone who had a hot tub in a tent in their backyard that they were putting down as a short term rental.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2268.434s">[Bears]</a>: And that got immediately, you know, code enforcement went out they said that's, you can't do that and it wasn't allowed but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2275.698s">[Bears]</a>: the limited code enforcement resources we have in the city really mean that it's on the residents to report these situations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2283.869s">[Bears]</a>: And even when they do report them, it takes some time to get some enforcement out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2287.674s">[Bears]</a>: I really think that we should<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2289.622s">[Bears]</a>: be more proactive, I think we'd find a lot of rental units coming back onto the market that are currently being used as profit centers in this way, and that would help with our housing crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2298.45s">[Bears]</a>: So, the two things I'm asking for are that there be more resources and requirements provided to code enforcement so that they can do their job more effectively, but also I do know that thanks to to to Mr. Jopelson and others that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2313.163s">[Bears]</a>: have informed me that other cities have had created direct liaison relationships with the major short term rental sites, which have allowed the city to report issues directly to them and have listings removed so that they can't be rented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2325.132s">[Bears]</a>: So I think both of those solutions need to be explored quickly and implemented so that our zoning ordinance is being followed by these folks who are breaking the law right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2339.844s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2376.715s">[Bears]</a>: I saw they passed something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2392.178s">[Bears]</a>: And if you're not, you can only do it a maximum of 90 days a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2396.438s">[Bears]</a>: It's pretty strict.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2396.998s">[Bears]</a>: We went pretty strict on the first pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2398.659s">[Bears]</a>: I don't mind going and taking another look, but the most important thing is that the strict ordinance we have now be enforced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3078.963s">[Bears]</a>: And if I could just, I just do want to reiterate Councilor Knight's point, which I tried to make clear in my resolution just prior to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3088.398s">[Bears]</a>: Two things are clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3089.119s">[Bears]</a>: I've talked I've been working with Elliot talking to code enforcement about this I've been hearing from other folks about You know different issues code enforcement goes out when they hear about it, but they Basically the way we're doing code enforcement city generally in the way that it's structured is not what it needs to be you know essentially<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3109.005s">[Bears]</a>: The building departments code enforcement, and they're more focused on things like this and building inspection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3121.813s">[Bears]</a>: And yeah, and that's what I'm that's what I'm getting at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3123.674s">[Bears]</a>: Right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3123.935s">[Bears]</a>: Like they're doing great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3124.915s">[Bears]</a>: They're doing an awesome job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3125.996s">[Bears]</a>: I'm talking to them directly about what they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3128.538s">[Bears]</a>: And you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3130.259s">[Bears]</a>: essentially, you know, they've been doing, there should be a code enforcement officer at DPW looking at stuff in the public way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3136.24s">[Bears]</a>: The building department's been covering for that for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3139.021s">[Bears]</a>: I think we need to have a serious discussion about inspectional services and code enforcement in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3143.682s">[Bears]</a>: What's the resource level?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3144.942s">[Bears]</a>: How are they collaborating?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3146.002s">[Bears]</a>: Which departments are doing each job?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3147.442s">[Bears]</a>: Because clearly, on this issue, I think we're about to hear another major issue about overgrowth and trash and issues in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3156.013s">[Bears]</a>: on Emory Street tonight, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3158.535s">[Bears]</a>: Clearly they don't have the resources and the support they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3161.396s">[Bears]</a>: The flip side of that is we can advocate, we pass the zoning ordinance, we communicate when we can, when we hear from a resident or we hear from code enforcement, we try to make those links.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3171.342s">[Bears]</a>: Actually funding or making a structural change to how we do inspectional services, only the mayor has the power to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3178.647s">[Bears]</a>: Actually saying, hey, code enforcement,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3181.168s">[Bears]</a>: You know, we need to prioritize creating an Airbnb liaison, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3185.05s">[Bears]</a>: Only the mayor can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3186.131s">[Bears]</a>: So does the mayor watch this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3223.846s">[Bears]</a>: Right, and that's kind of why I'm making the statement I'm making is we've now put a resolution on, our resolutions generally get a response from the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3232.108s">[Bears]</a>: The point of this resolution is to say, hey, we need to make this a priority, it's our request, please respond and tell us when and how you're going to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3239.97s">[Bears]</a>: Right now, all I can do is we can have another email or phone conversation with Dennis or Mike and we can- I'm gonna email the mayor next, but I'm gonna keep watching and annoying people until this house is shut down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3259.597s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3261.038s">[Bears]</a>: And so, you know, that's what I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3263.04s">[Bears]</a>: I want to be clear that we have our eyes on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3265.021s">[Bears]</a>: We've been working on this legislatively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3267.162s">[Bears]</a>: We're going to be pushing for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3268.883s">[Bears]</a>: It's a partnership in a two-way street in terms of we can make the request, but the action has to come from the office of the mayor, because that's who runs enforcement and who supervises the staff of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3278.87s">[Bears]</a>: So- Well, now that I've spoken to you, I will now go and try and pursue it there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3283.232s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, and I'm happy to help on that direction too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3286.194s">[Bears]</a>: I would love to have a conversation with the council and the mayor and code enforcement about what should inspectional services look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3293.993s">[Bears]</a>: in the city as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3460.462s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3461.123s">[Bears]</a>: And I just want to add, I think on this specific one, you found the answer, which is we should just be saying directly to the company, you have to remove the listing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3467.346s">[Bears]</a>: And that, that, that strips out the entire process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3470.088s">[Bears]</a>: And then, you know, you have the people with the authority to make that from the city side who have the legal authority to have that enforcement happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3478.633s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4267.833s">[Bears]</a>: I believe it's one large six-story building and then smaller outbuilding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4447.497s">[Bears]</a>: Oh, can I go first?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4451.699s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4452.22s">[Bears]</a>: I wanna acknowledge what Mr. Paige Lieberman just said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4455.622s">[Bears]</a>: I think it's not targeting people who use Airbnb.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4460.124s">[Bears]</a>: I think there's obviously cases and situations where there's need for people to have short-term accommodations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4465.908s">[Bears]</a>: I think it's the question of, historically, until these app companies came in and said, oh, we're gonna make a premium off of people's homes, renting them out,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4476.257s">[Bears]</a>: people stayed at hotels, which have regulations, they have specific security requirements, taxation requirements, there is a suites, I think it's a town place suites or some Marriott suites in Medford that has a kitchen and some bedrooms in it, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4489.664s">[Bears]</a>: Like, but while there are certainly reasonable and valid use cases, I think when you have a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4497.142s">[Bears]</a>: there are people renting single family homes for $1,000 a night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4500.824s">[Bears]</a>: If you can make $360,000 a year, and maybe you won't rent it out every night, but say you rent it out half the nights, you can make $180,000 a year, why would you ever rent it long-term to a long-term tenant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4512.572s">[Bears]</a>: You just wouldn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4514.693s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, I wouldn't do that, but if you're just buying property to speculate on and seek profit motive, if you can make $180,000 a year versus $40,000 a year,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4523.632s">[Bears]</a>: you know, someone who has that profit motive or chooses to speculate on the land and housing in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4528.891s">[Bears]</a>: since we don't regulate it, they're gonna do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4530.793s">[Bears]</a>: And I just think that's, it's not about targeting the people who use Airbnbs, it's targeting the people who are buying housing and land in the city and turning it into micro hotels in neighborhoods that are unregulated because they can make an extra $100,000 a year off of land that should be used for people to live here, to live here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4551.21s">[Bears]</a>: And that's really more where I'm coming from on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4553.291s">[Bears]</a>: I'm not one to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4556.772s">[Bears]</a>: Be mad that people are having fun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4558.332s">[Bears]</a>: I like having fun too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4560.093s">[Bears]</a>: So I just don't think that the landlord making $100,000 a year in profit by taking a housing unit away from a family who wants to live here should be able to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4569.115s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5114.59s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5115.771s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Anne, for coming down and bringing this forward and for working with Councilor Caraviello on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5120.392s">[Bears]</a>: I just want to propose an amendment to just add the traffic commission, because I believe the parking on Boston Ave is city-owned, so it would be the jurisdiction of the traffic commission, and a petition could go before them soon, and they could put the markings and signs out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5136.776s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, it would be under their authority to put that out, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5147.663s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I've seen that, and they're not paying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5154.687s">[Bears]</a>: And the reason I just want to add the Traffic Commission is because there's the two things here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5158.329s">[Bears]</a>: One is the Traffic Commission could mark those as handicapped spots at their next meeting, changing enforcement and requiring enforcement that, you know, we've had a lot of discussions about that tonight, haven't we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5423.134s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5423.935s">[Bears]</a>: I think this has kind of become the theme of the night, so I'm happy to just kind of quickly move through this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5428.918s">[Bears]</a>: We can move to the specific resolution that Councilor Caraviello filed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5432.601s">[Bears]</a>: But really, the intent here is just to say that we need to have a discussion about code enforcement and inspectional services in the city, getting them the resources they need, putting that under the correct structure, because there's just tons of civil code violations happening all the time that are, you know, either going unaddressed or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5448.968s">[Bears]</a>: are overwhelming code enforcement or, you know, a lot of them are getting reported by residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5454.274s">[Bears]</a>: So if there isn't a resident in a place who knows how to report something, or doesn't have access to the systems or is new to the area, maybe that thing just never even gets to the people who can enforce it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5464.574s">[Bears]</a>: And there's also the specific issues that I've definitely had communications from and have annual communications from folks in the Hillside neighborhood as it relates to Tufts University students and landlords.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5477.082s">[Bears]</a>: So that's the intent of this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5479.924s">[Bears]</a>: Happy to move through it and have the discussion that folks are here to have on Councilor Caraviello's resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6652.874s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I mean, I just want to say to the points that you made, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6659.124s">[Bears]</a>: You've been fighting the same fight for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6662.406s">[Bears]</a>: You haven't seen the enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6663.807s">[Bears]</a>: It's because the enforcement hasn't been funded the whole time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6667.889s">[Bears]</a>: And that's fundamentally the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6670.231s">[Bears]</a>: This council doesn't have the ability to increase funding for anything by a single dollar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6674.173s">[Bears]</a>: All we can do once a year is cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6676.855s">[Bears]</a>: We can take more away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6678.676s">[Bears]</a>: That's the only power the city charter gives us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6681.257s">[Bears]</a>: And I know I've communicated with all of you here about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6688.629s">[Bears]</a>: I'm glad you're voicing the issue again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6690.653s">[Bears]</a>: I'm glad we're setting resolutions up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6692.598s">[Bears]</a>: I'm sure we'll get responses eventually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6694.382s">[Bears]</a>: It's an incredibly difficult position to sit here and say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6700.646s">[Bears]</a>: here you say can you help us and me basically have to think, and I'm just going to voice it now and say, functionally no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6707.211s">[Bears]</a>: Right, you've come up and you've asked the Council for 10 years for help, and it's the same charter and different members of the Council completely right, you could say people love the Council 10 years ago and they hate me and you know whatever completely different Council, same issues, and quite frankly it's going to be the same response because this Council whether it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6724.295s">[Bears]</a>: the people here now or the people here 12 years ago, neither of those councils could raise any funding for any department by a single dollar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6731.138s">[Bears]</a>: That power only lies with the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6732.739s">[Bears]</a>: And I'm sorry that we can't do more for you to help you other than try to be advocates from the position that we're in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6783.27s">[Bears]</a>: You know, I don't know if other Councilors have haven't answered the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6789.036s">[Bears]</a>: My understanding is that other than the parking<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6792.349s">[Bears]</a>: parking and permitting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6793.33s">[Bears]</a>: I haven't seen civil code enforcement violations as a major source of revenue for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6797.654s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know if that's because it actually costs more to send people out to enforce it than we're allowed to fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6802.759s">[Bears]</a>: I think we're limited at our maximum to $300 per issuance on the fine by state law, 350 maybe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6810.026s">[Bears]</a>: So I don't know the answer to your question is all I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7268.379s">[Bears]</a>: We have a lot of issues with how the budget is formatted by the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7334.038s">[Bears]</a>: We still get access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7336.12s">[Bears]</a>: Only the mayor can ask it to be spent, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7349.45s">[Bears]</a>: We nominally have yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7352.953s">[Bears]</a>: That sounds beautiful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7354.794s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7356.075s">[Bears]</a>: We've made a lot of recommendations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7372.027s">[Bears]</a>: even if we use free cash reserves, which are basically just the reserves of the city for one time enforcement, they're one time funds, so wouldn't be hiring a permanent code enforcement officer if we use those reserves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7384.795s">[Bears]</a>: So it really is this longer term, bigger question of, are we funding enforcement in the city correctly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7392.78s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Caraviello's sixth term and every term, I think his answer has been, no, we're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7398.123s">[Bears]</a>: And he constantly is recommending every budget<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7401.095s">[Bears]</a>: under three mayors, if I'm correct, to change that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7406.078s">[Bears]</a>: Fundamentally, and Councilor I talked about earlier, I think we've all talked about it earlier, whether it's reallocating funding, reorganizing divisions, organizing a more proactive enforcement to bring in enough revenue to support the department or using funds, finding new revenue sources to fund it, whatever option we pick on any of those things, that is the administration of the city and that's under the executive<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7431.087s">[Bears]</a>: branch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7431.707s">[Bears]</a>: And we are the legislative branch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7433.768s">[Bears]</a>: And under our current charter, we don't have the authority to order, you know, maybe maybe we could pass an ordinance to say we reorganizing inspectional services, but I'm not necessarily even sure that the mayor has to follow that, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7445.391s">[Bears]</a>: Like, as we've noted tonight, we have an ordinance saying we will have a city solicitor, we haven't had a city solicitor for what 30 months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7451.833s">[Bears]</a>: So it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7456.178s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, it's just an incredibly frustrating situation to sit here and be trying to voice and engage and and work with residents to come up with to voice have hear residents voice in their concerns and difficulties and wanting to see the city become a better place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7469.648s">[Bears]</a>: In addition to, I agree that we do collect the property tax I would say the other thing that we as a city to effectively is this city council for the two terms that I've been on it has passed a lot of good ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7481.696s">[Bears]</a>: We've done a lot of good legislating we passed the road and control ordinance we passed the zoning ordinance on short term rental, we've tried to pass things giving code enforcement clear authority we've passed are working closely to pass a new waste ordinance right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7494.341s">[Bears]</a>: And we passed all these ordinances, and the staffing isn't there or the, you know, for whatever reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7501.264s">[Bears]</a>: the administration doesn't enforce those ordinances to the letter, and that is where the difficulty comes in, is we can pass the strongest and as many ordinances as we want, but if they don't get enforced by the mayor and her team, or the mayor doesn't come to us and say, I need more resources to enforce this ordinance, then we end up where we are, which is passing good ordinances that then don't get the follow-through that they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7527.699s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7805.614s">[Bears]</a>: I'll just be fast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7806.594s">[Bears]</a>: We've been here so long and talked so long that I'm sure some folks have had to use the bathrooms at City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7812.259s">[Bears]</a>: And I think that the bathrooms at City Hall are actually one of the best examples of how deeply underfunded the entire city is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7819.584s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think they've been updated since the building was built in 1937.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7823.51s">[Bears]</a>: You know, it is not it is it is not a good experience for a resident to use the bathroom and city hall for any staff to use it, and I just bring it up because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7833.351s">[Bears]</a>: On every single issue, all of the capital infrastructure that the city owns and manages, we have one of the worst water and sewer systems in the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7842.333s">[Bears]</a>: We have roads and sidewalks that are in a state of disrepair, trees, you know, we have public buildings like this building that are needing massive renovation, and that's just the capital side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7853.135s">[Bears]</a>: You come to the operating side, and it's a massive underfunding of code enforcement, health sanitarians, rodent control and animal control, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7863.493s">[Bears]</a>: people to look at the ADA issues around the city, teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7868.934s">[Bears]</a>: basically everything that the city is doing, with the exception of a couple of things that have been highly prioritized, like public safety and emergency response, have been massively gutted over the last 40 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7881.94s">[Bears]</a>: And, you know, if the plan is, hopefully there'll be enough, you know, we're gonna pass the zoning and new projects are coming in and that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7889.523s">[Bears]</a>: If the plan from the administration is fingers crossed in five to 10 years, the council zoning will bring in enough commercial development that maybe we'll start being able to fund things again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7898.447s">[Bears]</a>: It's just not acceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7900.188s">[Bears]</a>: So, you know, we talked about being a broken record we've I think brought up all the great broken record subjects tonight of all of our different priorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7908.996s">[Bears]</a>: I'll bring up mine, which is the city needs more money to do its job the city does not have enough money to effectively staff, basic operations or maintain basic capital infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7919.464s">[Bears]</a>: And I don't think that new growth and waiting to do that is the plan, but I also agree with my fellow Councilors that in addition to that understanding, and those are just the numbers of the budget if you look at over the last 40 years, we're in an even worse position, because we're not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7935.058s">[Bears]</a>: even using what we have to the best of its effectiveness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7938.16s">[Bears]</a>: So it is a double-edged sword.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7940.521s">[Bears]</a>: It is both not having enough resources to do everything we need to do and not prioritizing the limited resources we have to be used to their most effective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7949.965s">[Bears]</a>: And I think that basically rules the day on almost every topic that comes before this council at every meeting that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8426.716s">[Bears]</a>: I'd like to propose a B paper to ask the clerk to compare the length of the captions to the length of the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8436.442s">[Bears]</a>: But I would also, that's a joke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8438.063s">[Bears]</a>: I'll move to refer to, do you have a preference of subcommittee, Councilor Knight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8466.33s">[Bears]</a>: Motion to refer to subcommittee on ordinances and rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8535.301s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8537.241s">[Bears]</a>: I'll be as brief as I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8538.442s">[Bears]</a>: The Tufts RAs went on a one-day strike last week, and I was happy to support them and this council also.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8545.62s">[Bears]</a>: asked Tufts to recognize their union and instead Tufts forced an election, which lengthened the process by months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8550.882s">[Bears]</a>: And now we have the contract process lengthened by months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8553.943s">[Bears]</a>: So these folks don't have a fair contract when the new school year started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8557.184s">[Bears]</a>: But the bigger and more important point I wanna make about this is I spent four years working to bring together students and workers and community members and communities to hold universities accountable to treating everybody fairly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8571.89s">[Bears]</a>: And really the most important thing about that is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8575.011s">[Bears]</a>: whether it's RAs or students on campus or residents in the neighborhood around Tufts who are not getting fair and equitable treatment by Tufts or Tufts is taking actions that negatively impact the community or the folks on campus, we're all in the same fight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8594.056s">[Bears]</a>: Tufts is a billion dollar institution, multi-billion dollar institution run by a small group of people who make decisions that a lot of people disagree with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8603.027s">[Bears]</a>: And we can all fight our fights with Tufts separately if we want, but we're actually stronger together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8608.71s">[Bears]</a>: So one of the reasons I think it's important for community members and the city council to support the Tufts RAs is because if we build that relationship, we can call on the Tufts RAs to support us in asking for and fighting for a bigger pilot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8621.055s">[Bears]</a>: And there was an interview today, the Tufts Daily interviewed the new president of Tufts, and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8628.178s">[Bears]</a>: the student reporters were making that point too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8631.661s">[Bears]</a>: They said, well, what about the impact that Tufts has on the surrounding community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8634.804s">[Bears]</a>: And the president says, oh, we, you know, new president says that we try really hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8638.106s">[Bears]</a>: And to give him fair credit, he seemed to be taking a better tone on it than I've heard in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8642.67s">[Bears]</a>: But he said, you know, we wanted to hear about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8644.772s">[Bears]</a>: We want to try really hard to support this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8647.054s">[Bears]</a>: And the student pushed back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8648.715s">[Bears]</a>: So we have the narrative that we've been talking about by reaching out to Tufts students, reaching out and working with the workers on campus about the impact of Tufts on the communities and the neighborhoods that it lives in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8661.14s">[Bears]</a>: That message is breaking through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8662.761s">[Bears]</a>: And if we can all work together to hold Tufts accountable to do better, we have a much better shot than we do of doing it alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8668.343s">[Bears]</a>: So that is the larger message and point of why it's important to build relationships and show solidarity like this, because what goes around comes around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8677.167s">[Bears]</a>: They're mistreating the RAs today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8678.746s">[Bears]</a>: that we mistreat in the neighborhood tomorrow and someone else the next day, and it's better off if we work together to fight that than if we do it alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8686.251s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9357.736s">[Bears]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9360.397s">[Bears]</a>: Just three things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9361.657s">[Bears]</a>: One, on Tufts, it's not about villain or hero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9365.78s">[Bears]</a>: their budgets $1.2 billion a year the city's budgets 200 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9369.785s">[Bears]</a>: They have 2.4 billion in endowment we have 25 million in reserves, they're rich we're not, it's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9375.351s">[Bears]</a>: I'll leave it there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9378.554s">[Bears]</a>: The second thing I'll say just on the union workers, I hear you, I understand the issues with the contracts that workers have here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9385.307s">[Bears]</a>: I know it's not a position that everyone back here wants to say, because it's technically a position of saying that there's an unjust law that public sector workers can't strike.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9393.732s">[Bears]</a>: I support state-level legislation to let them strike.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9396.314s">[Bears]</a>: And I said to workers that came up here, if you took a strike action, I would walk on the picket line with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9401.537s">[Bears]</a>: I don't care if it's illegal or not illegal by state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9405.199s">[Bears]</a>: It's a bad law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9406.18s">[Bears]</a>: And it means that bargaining goes on forever for 700, 800, 900 days with no timeline on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9411.123s">[Bears]</a>: And the workers have no leverage, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9413.084s">[Bears]</a>: The point of the union is that you have collective power and part of collective power is taking a job action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9418.246s">[Bears]</a>: I guarantee you if the firefighters in the community, which is an even bigger thing to go public safety, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9424.069s">[Bears]</a>: The firefighters in the community went on strike for 12 hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9427.13s">[Bears]</a>: Everyone in the city would lose their minds and they'd have a contract the next day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9430.031s">[Bears]</a>: I'm not saying that's the best policy in the world, but at the very least state law needs to change so that they don't sit for 700 days before a contract goes to arbitration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9438.094s">[Bears]</a>: So I just wanted to put that point out there that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9442.267s">[Bears]</a>: You know, we support the workers to, there's a lot that needs to change around public sector bargaining.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3651.089s">[Bears]</a>: Madam President, can we take papers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3652.63s">[Bears]</a>: 20-024, 23-044, 23-057, and 23-058, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3654.332s">[Bears]</a>: Okay, so we're still under suspension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3655.493s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think we have to vote on that, correct, Mr. Clerk?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3661.258s">[Bears]</a>: All right, so 20-024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3692.164s">[Bears]</a>: President, motion to waive the reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3740.745s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3744.686s">[Bears]</a>: Just a quick summary this is we've discussed this many times now over the past three years and committee and subcommittee This is a proposal to create an affordable housing trust for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3754.109s">[Bears]</a>: This would create a trust of the provisions of state law where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3759.477s">[Bears]</a>: City funds private funds etc could be pulled for the benefit of creating more affordable housing in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3769.082s">[Bears]</a>: This has been reported out of committee, just the latest updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3775.41s">[Bears]</a>: Motion when this is reported on a committee in November was to request comments from Greater Boston Building Trades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3780.633s">[Bears]</a>: They have submitted a letter of comment through the Greater Boston Labor Council, which was included in our packets last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3787.997s">[Bears]</a>: I also have distributed a short, there's two minor technical amendments that need to be made here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3794.621s">[Bears]</a>: I just caught a couple of typos when I was reading through the, well, caught a couple of typos and a couple of typos were brought to my attention looking through the ordinance on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3805.094s">[Bears]</a>: I'm happy to present them, but there's one in section 49-52, which the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3812.668s">[Bears]</a>: Number four should be replaced with the remaining members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3815.09s">[Bears]</a>: It says the board shall be composed of seven members, but then it says one shall be the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3819.333s">[Bears]</a>: One may be a member of the Community Preservation Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3821.614s">[Bears]</a>: And then it says four, that would only add up to six or maybe even five if the may of the Community Preservation Committee members considered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3828.839s">[Bears]</a>: So I just proposed a technical amendment to strike the number four and replace it with the words, the remaining members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3837.355s">[Bears]</a>: And then in section 49-54, subsection 11, just clarifying language here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3847.506s">[Bears]</a>: that we had put into the ordinance, just to explain that borrowed by the trust shall pledge any borrowing that pledges more than 70% of the cash assets of the trust for Park City Council approvals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3861.93s">[Bears]</a>: It was just a little bit confusing there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3864.251s">[Bears]</a>: And I talked that over with planning development and sustainability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3867.552s">[Bears]</a>: So I would move to amend<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3873.137s">[Bears]</a>: the ordinance to reflect those two technical amendments, which all Councilors should have and the clerk should have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3880.924s">[Bears]</a>: And I would also move to attach the letter of comment received from the Greater Boston Labor Council and require the trustees to incorporate the language provided by the Greater Boston Labor Council into the rules and regulations of the Affordable Housing Trust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3895.637s">[Bears]</a>: And so that would be the language that we received back regarding project labor agreements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3919.67s">[Bears]</a>: It clearly reads any borrowing by the trust that pledges, any borrowing by the trust pledging more than 75, 70% of the assets of the trust requires city council approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3929.934s">[Bears]</a>: The change would be any borrowing by the trust that pledges more than 70% of the cash assets of the trust requires city council approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3946.77s">[Bears]</a>: And I would propose those amendments and to approve the ordinance for first reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4240.373s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4241.273s">[Bears]</a>: I just wanna second what Councilor Knight said and thanks to former Councilor Falco for advancing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4248.255s">[Bears]</a>: When it was first,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4250.242s">[Bears]</a>: On the agenda and I saw my name next to I said that doesn't seem right I don't think I proposed this in January 2020 but that's because Councilor talk with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4256.489s">[Bears]</a>: So, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4867.762s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, that's a complicated question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4871.945s">[Bears]</a>: The housing trust can do a lot of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4873.606s">[Bears]</a>: If the housing trust funds a private project on private land, then that project would pay property taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4881.772s">[Bears]</a>: The fund was, you know, there could be a complicated arrangement where perhaps the city is leasing public land to a private developer I believe that would also constitute paying property taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4895.185s">[Bears]</a>: If the city were to say have a piece of land that's currently public land that currently doesn't pay property taxes, because the city would just be paying taxes to itself, and that were to be conveyed to the Affordable Housing Trust, it wouldn't start paying property taxes until it was conveyed to sold or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4913.239s">[Bears]</a>: But I don't know if that answers your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4915.741s">[Bears]</a>: It's not so simple as a yes or no answer, but if funding for this goes to private projects, then those would pay property taxes, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5933.601s">[Bears]</a>: BMX guy, maybe I like analogies and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5942.165s">[Bears]</a>: Just two questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5945.006s">[Bears]</a>: Well, one comment, one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5946.227s">[Bears]</a>: One, I was talking to Steve today, the other day, and he seemed pretty excited about some of the new equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5952.169s">[Bears]</a>: So that was a good sign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5955.491s">[Bears]</a>: Second piece, just to kind of contextualize this, and just let me know if I'm getting it wrong, the assessment that we did, what, two fiscal years ago now, almost three fiscal years ago now, the sidewalk scope alone was 25, 30 million, right, to get to a state of good repair, maybe even more than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5970.997s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, it's a year in the ballpark.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5973.659s">[Bears]</a>: Okay, so I just wanted to put that out there that, you know, 1.5 million or, you know, to 1.5 million may sound like a lot but it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5983.345s">[Bears]</a>: 10% of what our need is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5985.025s">[Bears]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5994.21s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5995.51s">[Bears]</a>: And kind of just want to again confirm here is when you're talking about, you know, that reflects the revenue issue and the funding issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6002.714s">[Bears]</a>: You know, we need more people we need more equipment we need to really get at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6006.776s">[Bears]</a>: But<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6007.756s">[Bears]</a>: The strategy you're talking about just to inform that a little bit more that's also coming partially from the sidewalk assessment of the street assessment as well as some additional research that you've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6036.262s">[Bears]</a>: And I don't want to reiterate something you already said but I just want to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6039.932s">[Bears]</a>: make sure I'm understanding it right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6041.333s">[Bears]</a>: Basically what you're trying to do is pivot resources so that smaller things that we can address in-house, we have the tools and the capacity to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6049.02s">[Bears]</a>: And then for the bigger projects, we're focusing on the areas that are most trafficked, where the sidewalks are most used in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6059.95s">[Bears]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6061.511s">[Bears]</a>: So I think that really shows that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6065.325s">[Bears]</a>: To me, something we always talk about is making sure that given the fact that we have limited resources and a lot of need, we're best using the resources that we currently have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6073.235s">[Bears]</a>: And it seems to me that that's what your departments are really doing with this situation and what you're asking us for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6080.504s">[Bears]</a>: Obviously, we have a lot more that needs to be done, but it does seem to be that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6085.069s">[Bears]</a>: you are trying to acquire the equipment and, you know, put forward the contracts where we can address issues as they happen and address the areas of the city that need help the most.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6098.716s">[Bears]</a>: So that's a comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6099.516s">[Bears]</a>: You don't have to respond to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6100.576s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6320.897s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6324.139s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I mean, to the point around delaying this, you know, I'd be comfortable tabling for our one meeting and requesting an opinion from the Attorney General.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6334.748s">[Bears]</a>: I think the other thing we just need to hear, and again, a lot of this is a communication question, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6340.212s">[Bears]</a>: On the finances, we had what I thought was a good conversation last week with the finance director on the revenue side of finance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6349.039s">[Bears]</a>: I think the question obviously is going to be on the expense side of finance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6351.981s">[Bears]</a>: And there's, you know, communication that needs to happen there where, you know, we need, they just need to get us information that we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6362.307s">[Bears]</a>: But in any case, I think the communication issue here is to Councilor Knight's point, we have not heard the administration say that KP Law is functioning as the acting city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6373.072s">[Bears]</a>: Now, in all senses of all operations of the city, they are obviously serving as the acting city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6382.748s">[Bears]</a>: I just think we need to get them, somebody from the administration needs to come here and say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6386.31s">[Bears]</a>: So personally, I would feel comfortable tabling this to our next meeting on March 14th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6392.993s">[Bears]</a>: If we want to send it to the Attorney General's office for legal review, that's fine with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6396.235s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, Bond Council reviewed this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6397.575s">[Bears]</a>: I believe Bond Council, Jay Gonzalez reviewed this, you know, and that's the Bond Council we've always used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6403.738s">[Bears]</a>: KP Law obviously wrote this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6405.439s">[Bears]</a>: If they're functioning as the acting city solicitor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6407.98s">[Bears]</a>: I think we should just need to know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6410.863s">[Bears]</a>: I hear everyone on the legal question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6413.306s">[Bears]</a>: Quite frankly, we held the administration to account to fund an assistant city solicitor and the position still is unfilled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6423.956s">[Bears]</a>: Now, we can debate why the position's unfilled, sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6429.181s">[Bears]</a>: But in my view, we won that fight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6433.325s">[Bears]</a>: We said we want in-house legal counsel and the budget has in-house legal counsel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6437.226s">[Bears]</a>: The question is just bringing the people on in those positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6441.748s">[Bears]</a>: So I just, I hear what everyone's saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6445.649s">[Bears]</a>: If the administration would just say whether or not KP Law is serving as the acting city solicitor, I think that would be helpful communication for us to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6453.348s">[Bears]</a>: and maybe it would change our view and potentially a little bit about who they work for and who they don't work for, because I believe if they are serving as acting city solicitor, they would be working for us too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6463.615s">[Bears]</a>: But in any case, I'm happy to support a tabling for one meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6468.578s">[Bears]</a>: And I would request either request to amend council rights motion or propose a separate motion that we request that the mayor and city administration<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6479.945s">[Bears]</a>: tell the council whether or not KP law is currently serving as the acting city solicitor for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6485.747s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7190.307s">[Bears]</a>: I think we should amend the charter so the council appoints a city solicitor, but that's just my thoughts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7240.676s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7242.958s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President, just because I think we have kind of three prongs of things here now on the table and we should move forward as best we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7254.984s">[Bears]</a>: One is Councilor Knight saying that he wants the Attorney General's office to review whether this is acceptable relative to our city ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7264.371s">[Bears]</a>: The second is something that I brought up, which is if the mayor could state whether or not in her view, KP Law is functioning as the acting city solicitor for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7274.659s">[Bears]</a>: And the third thing Councilor Collins brought up is an update on the hiring process for the city solicitor, the assistant city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7285.639s">[Bears]</a>: I just want to, is that right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7288.14s">[Bears]</a>: That's what I was going to address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7294.264s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7295.825s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just, I'm trying to not, not trying to fill in for you at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7301.008s">[Bears]</a>: Madam president, just, I was just looking up very quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7306.912s">[Bears]</a>: There's a municipal law bureau at the attorney general's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7311.468s">[Bears]</a>: relative to those ideas, if everyone who proposed those three different ideas would be comfortable, can we move to table this for one meeting till March 14th, request that the city clerk call the Municipal Law Bureau at the Attorney General's office tomorrow or this week and request that review that Councilor Knight asked for, or ask what the process would be for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7335.351s">[Bears]</a>: and then also ask that the administration get back to us in 10 days around my question and Councilor Collins' question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7341.412s">[Bears]</a>: And then in two weeks, we will have some sort of response back from the Attorney General.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7347.074s">[Bears]</a>: It may not be a full response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7349.094s">[Bears]</a>: It may say, this is the process you need to go through to get us to do this, or we don't do this, or whatever else it may be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7354.655s">[Bears]</a>: But I just wanted to put some timelines and a shock box on the whole thing, because I agree we need the right answer, but I also agree that we should try to move as fast as we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7364.455s">[Bears]</a>: Does that make sense to everybody, the three folks who proposed motions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7631.839s">[Bears]</a>: Any members of the Council wish to speak, I'm happy to hear from them first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7800.775s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7801.776s">[Bears]</a>: I respect my colleagues positions on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7803.917s">[Bears]</a>: I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7805.452s">[Bears]</a>: There's been a number of issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7806.653s">[Bears]</a>: I think that maybe the chain of events and the opinions are getting a little bit conflated, but I, again, I respect my fellow councilors positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7818.083s">[Bears]</a>: To me, the way that this is presented tonight, it's very clear that a new position in the city does not exist until it is approved in the cap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7826.289s">[Bears]</a>: This is presented as a new position to be added to the cap, which did not exist prior to any action that we take on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7835.1s">[Bears]</a>: We did receive legal advice from KP Law, a memorandum from KP Law around these issues, clearly delineating the requirements of Chapter 44, Section 33A.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7849.5s">[Bears]</a>: And when it comes to creating a new position,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7852.929s">[Bears]</a>: that requires four votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7855.45s">[Bears]</a>: If it's something else, there's other requirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7859.212s">[Bears]</a>: But this is, I think, to me, very similar to the senior planner position that was created by this council and amended to the CAF in late last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7867.575s">[Bears]</a>: And I also think, and I'm just gonna say what I said at that meeting,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7876.704s">[Bears]</a>: The work that we do here is a balancing of interests and a balancing of what's best for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7880.991s">[Bears]</a>: I personally feel confident on this paper and the legal justification behind it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7887.561s">[Bears]</a>: And I also feel that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7890.649s">[Bears]</a>: this person that the creation of a traffic and transportation director, and making sure that a person who fills that role has the multiple years of experience with the city that the person who would, you know, likely be taking the role has is essential, and we know that there are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7911.002s">[Bears]</a>: not enough experts to fill too many open jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7914.625s">[Bears]</a>: There are other communities, there are state agencies that are looking for people with the expertise of this position and that's why I personally am going to support this tonight because I want to make sure that this city<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7933.834s">[Bears]</a>: that we as a city council are making sure that the city has the staff and tools that the city needs to be successful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7940.782s">[Bears]</a>: And that's my reasoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7944.086s">[Bears]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8316.855s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8317.976s">[Bears]</a>: I'd move to approve this paper for first reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8329.807s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, and the other thing I would just say is I do believe the traffic and transportation director and the position was included in the new unit of management positions that was organized by level 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8339.369s">[Bears]</a>: So I don't believe there'll be a loss of the union position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8463.647s">[Bears]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8515.919s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8517.34s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, I'm in the affirmative to in the negative the emotion passes, Madam President motion to take 23 to 059 23 dash 060 and 23 dash 061 until our March 14 regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8654.623s">[Bears]</a>: Is this something you did, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8658.386s">[Bears]</a>: I just want Councilor Scavana to get credit for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8895.86s">[Bears]</a>: I found them in order, but I was just going to move to approve the records and all the reports of committees in one vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9113.557s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9115.017s">[Bears]</a>: I know you're on your way out the door, Commissioner McGibbert, but have you heard about this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9120.859s">[Bears]</a>: Do you know anything about this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9122.68s">[Bears]</a>: And or Councilor Knight, could you further say who's doing the clearcutting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9731.647s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9732.668s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Collins for sponsoring this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9736.156s">[Bears]</a>: I believe, I can't remember which one of us did it last time, but it was me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9743.283s">[Bears]</a>: You know, I think you made really great points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9745.686s">[Bears]</a>: Something that we did two years ago is we were able to look at assessor data at the City of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9750.59s">[Bears]</a>: And if Tufts, just Tufts for example, was taxed at the same rate as<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9755.945s">[Bears]</a>: was taxed at all for property taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9757.246s">[Bears]</a>: They would pay $8 million a year in property taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9761.327s">[Bears]</a>: Now, this law would only require up to 25% of what they would nominally pay, so it would be about $2 million a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9770.751s">[Bears]</a>: But I just want to say since we've had the discussions here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9773.634s">[Bears]</a>: That's $2 million for sidewalk crew to support our firefighters to support all the emergency calls that go out to tops to support street and sidewalk infrastructure repairs in their area to support affordable housing in the area around the top neighborhood, and I'm just putting that out there to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9791.437s">[Bears]</a>: I can understand why a nonprofit education or healthcare institution maybe shouldn't be treated the same as a for profit business, but I don't think the answer is that they should be treated, it should be 100% for one and 0% for the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9806.42s">[Bears]</a>: And I also want to put out there to this isn't just about tops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9809.403s">[Bears]</a>: This is about all of the large nonprofit institutions, and whether or not they play pay pilot payments to the city tops for example while this legislation would allow basically up to $2 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9821.076s">[Bears]</a>: If they paid normal private tax to be $8 million tops right now pays $450,000 to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9826.321s">[Bears]</a>: But other pilot agreements such as right across the street from this building, Harvard Vanguard used to pay a trace health whatever it is now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9835.432s">[Bears]</a>: They used to pay a pilot agreement and they pulled out of their power agreement unilaterally without any city engagement they no longer provide any.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9843.342s">[Bears]</a>: pilot payment to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9845.003s">[Bears]</a>: Something I'm exploring actually is that Atrius Health was just bought up and is now a for-profit institution, so maybe they'll have to start paying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9851.809s">[Bears]</a>: But my point is to say that right now, the way that the current state law reads,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9857.116s">[Bears]</a>: it's up to the discretion of the institution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9859.919s">[Bears]</a>: And that means that even if you have an agreement, the institution could pull out at any time and leave the city holding the bag.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9866.505s">[Bears]</a>: And we're already holding the bag for all the services and needs in the areas around these large institutions that they're not paying their fair share for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9875.374s">[Bears]</a>: So I really hope<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9878.049s">[Bears]</a>: that the State House can do something to create a fair system where we're still understanding that these are nonprofit health and education institutions that should have some benefit, but that benefit shouldn't be all or nothing the way it is now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9891.996s">[Bears]</a>: And furthermore, just to drive home the point, this is for large property owners, the threshold, your property has to be worth, I believe, over $15 million to even be qualified under this suggested amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9903.422s">[Bears]</a>: So thank you, Councilor Collins, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10442.205s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10443.306s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you to my fellow councilors, Councilor Caraviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10446.748s">[Bears]</a>: And I just wanted to also shout out Director of Prevention and Outreach, Penny Funiol, and also Alicia Lundgren, our social worker, who I believe has a presentation around this that's on the city website that President Burrell referenced, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10524.837s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10525.477s">[Bears]</a>: This is just us putting the fee of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10528.717s">[Bears]</a>: five cents per five for each square foot, about 5,000 square feet as a fee for plan development district applications into the code of ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10535.585s">[Bears]</a>: So I would move to approve for first reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10663.617s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10664.337s">[Bears]</a>: I would just add to Councilor Tseng's point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10665.918s">[Bears]</a>: I think he already made it, but I'm just kind of reiterating it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10668.879s">[Bears]</a>: When we have plans and we have hopes and approaches,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10674.926s">[Bears]</a>: I think the place where the city falls down after that is milestones and goals and checking in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10680.088s">[Bears]</a>: And I think this is a request for that on the social justice roadmap that's much needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10684.709s">[Bears]</a>: So thank you, Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=526.182s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, madam president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=527.343s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, attorney Stein.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=528.943s">[Bears]</a>: I just think to me, I feel like we've answered a lot of these questions already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=533.446s">[Bears]</a>: And we, we came up with this ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=535.967s">[Bears]</a>: Basically, to me, the goal of this ordinance is to say in the city right now, we feel comfortable allowing one day licenses and special event licenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=544.635s">[Bears]</a>: And we don't want that to have to come before the council every time we're being those are being asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=549.079s">[Bears]</a>: And I think that's basically the policy we're trying to implement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=552.562s">[Bears]</a>: And then beyond that, I don't think we wanted to make any changes beyond that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=556.265s">[Bears]</a>: But essentially, just to say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=558.137s">[Bears]</a>: food trucks are welcome for events.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=559.718s">[Bears]</a>: They're welcome for single day activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=562.32s">[Bears]</a>: They have to go through the Board of Health to ask for those, and that's essentially the city's policy on food trucks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=568.945s">[Bears]</a>: I don't want to speak for my other colleagues, although I'm seeing some nodding heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=573.769s">[Bears]</a>: So I think that's essentially the spirit of what we have put forward, and that's what this draft reflects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=578.492s">[Bears]</a>: And I guess my question<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=580.213s">[Bears]</a>: and feel free to answer after other colleagues have spoken, is just how do we take what we have drafted here, which I think we all believe reflected that general consensus, and turn that into something that fits the framework that you outlined where some of that, basically what I'm hearing is some of what's in this ordinance should be in the Board of Health Regulation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=600.92s">[Bears]</a>: I don't really have a problem with that, but that's basically my understanding of the scope, and I personally didn't want to go beyond<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=608.522s">[Bears]</a>: the scope of that general kind of those boundaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=611.507s">[Bears]</a>: So I'll leave it there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=612.369s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1308.616s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1310.477s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1312.078s">[Bears]</a>: Turnstein, through you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1314.56s">[Bears]</a>: I guess just, I'm just a little confused as to what our next steps are here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1324.146s">[Bears]</a>: It seems like we have a draft that we believe generally reflects the policies that we want to have for a food truck ordinance right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1335.305s">[Bears]</a>: how much, I guess my question is to you just based on your review of this draft, how much of this needs to be changed or what sections need to be moved out into the Board of Health regulations for us to move forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1348.012s">[Bears]</a>: Because I'll be honest, I thought we were basically gonna do some light legal review and then approve this ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1353.455s">[Bears]</a>: I didn't think we were going back and diving in really to any major questions at this stage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1360.439s">[Bears]</a>: So I guess just where are we going?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1365.011s">[Bears]</a>: you know, to me, I mean, if the question is that we don't feel like the Board of Health should be off, should be picking the location, I mean, I think that the applicants are picking the location and the Board of Health is saying yes or no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1379.575s">[Bears]</a>: And then we have this section nine here, which is all mobile food vendors wishing to sell food from public property, including any public street, sidewalk, playground or park must obtain permission to do so from the city department having jurisdiction over that property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1395.331s">[Bears]</a>: So to me, that makes it pretty clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1397.693s">[Bears]</a>: If you want it in a park, you have to go to the Parks Commission, or at least the Parks Department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1405.377s">[Bears]</a>: If you want it on a public way, that would probably be the DPW.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1411.321s">[Bears]</a>: So I guess I'm just not clear here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1414.823s">[Bears]</a>: It seems to me that the two outstanding things are there's a question over how much of what's currently in this ordinance should instead be part of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1424.211s">[Bears]</a>: a Board of Health regulation, and the section should point towards that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1427.953s">[Bears]</a>: I'm guessing that's maybe most of Section 6.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1431.575s">[Bears]</a>: And then it sounds like, I don't know if Director O'Connor has an opinion on it, or if you do, Attorney Stein.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1440.734s">[Bears]</a>: that some other entity within the city administration should be involved in the siting of the location of these food trucks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1449.985s">[Bears]</a>: But other than that, are there other issues with this current ordinance that I'm missing so far from our discussion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1612.756s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1614.006s">[Bears]</a>: I have two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1615.187s">[Bears]</a>: First, on the subject at hand, I think my motion would be to take this draft and put it in whatever form you believe is necessary to best affect its passage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1629.72s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know what to say beyond that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1633.462s">[Bears]</a>: You know, we had we had a draft, we thought we were going down the path that we should be going down best practice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1638.347s">[Bears]</a>: And now we're kind of at the moment where we thought we were pretty much done with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1642.772s">[Bears]</a>: And now we're being kind of told that the form and legal compliance of what has been drafted is not accurate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1649.239s">[Bears]</a>: So I mean, really, it would just be to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1651.431s">[Bears]</a>: for council and relevant departments to sit down and take this draft and reformulate it, package it into whatever it needs to be packaged into so that we can pass it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1662.058s">[Bears]</a>: My second question in terms of streetways may go a little bit outside this, but I'm just a little bit surprised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1669.284s">[Bears]</a>: Is it your opinion that whenever the city is hosting any sort of event using the public ways that the city council should give permission for that event to occur?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1811.808s">[Bears]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1812.309s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1812.629s">[Bears]</a>: And so just when we were talking earlier about the public way, it's because we feel like food trucks fall into the archaic kind of language that some council passed many years ago around not having like fruit sellers on sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1839.526s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1845.689s">[Bears]</a>: No, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1846.269s">[Bears]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1846.509s">[Bears]</a>: I cut you off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1846.97s">[Bears]</a>: My apologies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1898.686s">[Bears]</a>: Right, no, and that makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1900.787s">[Bears]</a>: And that's certainly what we want this to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1905.922s">[Bears]</a>: I just was, I was, you know, we often close public ways for events that are city hosted and the city council does not vote on the closing of those public ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1915.711s">[Bears]</a>: And I just wanted to make sure that those acts were not in conflict with our city ordinances separate from this discussion specifically around food trucks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1947.088s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1948.249s">[Bears]</a>: Then I would make the motion at this time that legal counsel<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1955.541s">[Bears]</a>: and the board, the health director, the interim economic development director, and any other relevant parties that the administration sees necessary to be part of this process, essentially take this draft ordinance that we've written and come back to us with their recommendations for amendments to the city ordinances, as well as the draft board of health regulation based on this, based on this document, because that sounds like it'll solve all our problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1985.763s">[Bears]</a>: I'm not 100% sure, but it sounds like that would address the issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2053.902s">[Bears]</a>: Do you need me to repeat the motion first?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2056.585s">[Bears]</a>: If I could just get Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2085.205s">[Bears]</a>: Sorry, make recommendations to amend the ordinance and to create a board of health regulation<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2099.926s">[Bears]</a>: that reflects the content of this current draft or the content or intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2123.207s">[Bears]</a>: To be finished solid waste as well, that's basically what we did with solid waste.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2127.575s">[Bears]</a>: I think so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2129.216s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2132.918s">[Bears]</a>: I know, we're constantly doing things, all these things that we do all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2284.013s">[Bears]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2284.593s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, just specifically on this topic, I mean, I would think that if a food truck wanted to come for a day to a brewery and put their truck there, that's one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2300.42s">[Bears]</a>: If they wanted to come 180 days or 365 days,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2305.031s">[Bears]</a>: That would not be something that we were interested in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2307.153s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think I think it was to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2309.054s">[Bears]</a>: It would still fall under this kind of concept of the one day or special event permit license.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2314.259s">[Bears]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2606.184s">[Bears]</a>: Motion to keep the paper committee and adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=17.98s">[Bears]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=76.825s">[Bears]</a>: Motion to suspend the rules to take papers 23-412.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=78.626s">[Bears]</a>: 23-412.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=84.224s">[Bears]</a>: 4-7-4, 2-3-4-7-5, 2-3-4-7-6.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=84.624s">[Bears]</a>: And that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=86.446s">[Bears]</a>: And the motion of Vice President Bears is to take 2-3-4-1-2, 2-3-4-7-4, 2-3-4-7-5, and 2-3-4-7-6 out of order, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=661.87s">[Bears]</a>: I would motion to, well, I don't want to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=664.612s">[Bears]</a>: I'll let you speak, but after you speak, I'm going to motion to table to a date, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=848.351s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=848.671s">[Bears]</a>: I would make the motion to table to January 9th our date certain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=853.607s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1059.613s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1060.854s">[Bears]</a>: This is an amendment or addendum to the previous resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1065.287s">[Bears]</a>: from November 14th that we joined with Councilor Scarpelli as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1068.81s">[Bears]</a>: There was one from Councilor Caraviello, President Morell and I, one from Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1073.594s">[Bears]</a>: Those were referred to the Elections Commission and the Elections Commission voted 3 to 1 to postpone their discussion of the item until their January meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1084.064s">[Bears]</a>: So I'm not particularly happy that that decision was made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1089.408s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1091.004s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think this should be something that waits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1094.026s">[Bears]</a>: Many of us here spent some time at City Hall on December 9th for the first and what happened to be the only day of the recount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1105.874s">[Bears]</a>: While the results of the recount did not change in any way the results of the election, I think what was found to be inaccurate was significant and concerning in the sense that if the election had been close or if any of the races had been close,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1121.638s">[Bears]</a>: Those numbers could have changed the results of an election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1128.945s">[Bears]</a>: almost 130 ballots in one precinct that somehow didn't get counted in the unofficial count, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1134.046s">[Bears]</a>: So in addition to everything that was in the resolution that we passed November 14th, which had to do with all of the things that happened that we knew at the time had happened up until election day and on election night, the recount also did expose a couple of other items for consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1153.591s">[Bears]</a>: And that's incredibly important to the community that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1158.832s">[Bears]</a>: We have answers to those questions and answers to the process and fixes to the process and staffing and resources in that department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1166.479s">[Bears]</a>: So that we have confidence that, number one, mistakes that were made in the past aren't going to be made again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1171.703s">[Bears]</a>: And number two, when mistakes happen, which in any human endeavor is inevitable that there will be things that go wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1179.841s">[Bears]</a>: the public is made aware and the candidates are made aware right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1183.484s">[Bears]</a>: I think that's really the most important thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1185.245s">[Bears]</a>: I know in the past when issues did occur, you know, and I haven't been involved as long as some other folks here, but Sandy Gale, Clark Hurtubise, others really did try to get the word out right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1199.437s">[Bears]</a>: We had this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1200.278s">[Bears]</a>: We want you to know what the issue was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1201.739s">[Bears]</a>: We want you to know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1203.24s">[Bears]</a>: how we tried to address it, or who we brought in to help address it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1206.022s">[Bears]</a>: I know that Finn had done similar things as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1209.085s">[Bears]</a>: And that has to be how our elections offices operate, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1213.248s">[Bears]</a>: If there is an issue, you get the word out right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1216.871s">[Bears]</a>: The operating procedure can't be that if there's an issue, you try to fix it without anyone noticing, because that just does not bring trust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1224.318s">[Bears]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1225.939s">[Bears]</a>: putting this on, formally putting on an item for this report to be on our agenda with the deadline of January 23rd, which is our first regular meeting after the next election commission meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1236.425s">[Bears]</a>: But I am disappointed that the election commission, I believe their rationale was that they had to plan for the recount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1242.028s">[Bears]</a>: I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1242.869s">[Bears]</a>: I wish they had had, uh, that they had considered an issue to response to this report in a more timely manner because there's an election in March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1251.293s">[Bears]</a>: The presidential primaries in March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1253.755s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1956.261s">[Bears]</a>: What was that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1956.701s">[Bears]</a>: Did you say give them a raise, Councilor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1958.382s">[Bears]</a>: I missed that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1959.223s">[Bears]</a>: What was that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1960.263s">[Bears]</a>: Motion to approve as amended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1961.844s">[Bears]</a>: Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2189.062s">[Bears]</a>: Madam President, motion to refer to the Zoning Planning and Development Subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2292.671s">[Bears]</a>: Madam President, while we're on suspension, motion to take public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2578.954s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2580.121s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2581.122s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, we received an email, Nate, that the state government is in the governor's executive office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2589.87s">[Bears]</a>: The state government is in negotiations with a private property owner at that location for housing of migrant families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2598.977s">[Bears]</a>: That's all we know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2599.918s">[Bears]</a>: And then I believe that the mayor's email also said that they are trying to negotiate to have the city in some way involved in that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2607.644s">[Bears]</a>: But right now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2608.803s">[Bears]</a>: the state and the private property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2610.124s">[Bears]</a>: I can read it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2611.084s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2612.725s">[Bears]</a>: I can share this with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2614.186s">[Bears]</a>: Sure, that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3010.635s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3011.535s">[Bears]</a>: I just want to, in terms of like next steps and actions, this wasn't on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3017.762s">[Bears]</a>: We shouldn't debate that since it wasn't on the agenda, wasn't publicly posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3020.646s">[Bears]</a>: We're talking about transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3021.827s">[Bears]</a>: We shouldn't take action on things that we didn't let the public know we were going to talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3027.334s">[Bears]</a>: I just wanted to take it back to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3030.077s">[Bears]</a>: I did ask a follow up of the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3031.679s">[Bears]</a>: The mayor said the state basically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3034.235s">[Bears]</a>: If the state signs a contract with the property owner, that's the arrangement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3038.717s">[Bears]</a>: The city has no input, no involvement, unless the state wants to give the city involvement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3043.899s">[Bears]</a>: So if the state and the property owner sign an agreement, that's what's going to be what happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3050.001s">[Bears]</a>: The city doesn't have, the state comes in and they can do what they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3052.783s">[Bears]</a>: So that's where this is at, is my understanding, because I wanted to follow up specifically on that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3059.805s">[Bears]</a>: And I believe the mayor's email<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3061.566s">[Bears]</a>: is written in the way to show specifically concern that if the state and the property owner just make an agreement without considering the city, since they don't legally have to consult the city and the city doesn't own the property, it's a private land and the state is trying to pay, essentially lease private property for their own purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3082.283s">[Bears]</a>: Her concern, to my understanding, reading of the email and my follow-up question, was that the city be consulted and engaged in that process in some way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3090.472s">[Bears]</a>: but that essentially the state can just sign an agreement with this private property owner if they wish to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3167.171s">[Bears]</a>: Motion, second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3187.927s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3190.089s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Caraviello has served with me the entire time that I've been on the City Council, and we've served through a pandemic, zoning recodification, two city elections since I was elected,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3209.867s">[Bears]</a>: I think 15, 16, 17 ordinances maybe at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3214.229s">[Bears]</a>: And I have been really lucky to learn from Councilor Caraviello, to work with Councilor Caraviello, especially on development projects and trying to engage property owners, trying to engage people who want to come to the city and build new good things in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3230.355s">[Bears]</a>: I think sometimes we've been successful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3233.979s">[Bears]</a>: Sometimes we haven't been as successful as we wanted to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3237.163s">[Bears]</a>: And I personally really want, and I'm hoping if Carol lets you, that you will give a little more time and give me a call if you see a good opportunity or you hear someone who wants to come to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3253.022s">[Bears]</a>: and wants to talk to a city councilor about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3256.164s">[Bears]</a>: But I also think you've more than earned some time off, time with family, after many, many years of public service, not just on the council, but before your time on the council in volunteerism and service to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3268.814s">[Bears]</a>: So thank you, and I will miss you as a colleague, and I hope that you get to spend many vacations getting suntanned and enjoying some time in warm places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=4050.054s">[Bears]</a>: I just wanted to add one more thing, and I'm sorry to speak out of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=4054.196s">[Bears]</a>: second time already, but I think it's a testament to how much you've done your service to the city, your service to your colleagues, your devotion to your family, that none of us mentioned that you also got us a brand new library.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=4070.968s">[Bears]</a>: And I just, you know, again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=4074.798s">[Bears]</a>: It's a beautiful place that thousands of people are using every day that wouldn't be here if you hadn't put in incredibly hard work to get it here, to get it funded after the fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=4085.905s">[Bears]</a>: And it's going to be there for generations and have your name in a few places on it as well deserved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=4091.989s">[Bears]</a>: So I just wanted to say that and also to say that this council, I think especially this term, we don't agree all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=4101.462s">[Bears]</a>: but we care for each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=4103.624s">[Bears]</a>: We agree, we agree to disagree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=4106.506s">[Bears]</a>: And we know that we all care so much about Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=4111.309s">[Bears]</a>: And I think you lead with that, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=4114.851s">[Bears]</a>: We've disagreed on many things, but I've never felt like you didn't respect me and I didn't respect you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=4119.735s">[Bears]</a>: And I think that's incredibly important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=4121.136s">[Bears]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5185.323s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5186.403s">[Bears]</a>: I have been lucky enough<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5188.26s">[Bears]</a>: to have Councilor Knight here to tell me everything I'm doing wrong, every meeting, quietly, which is what I appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5199.203s">[Bears]</a>: And occasionally, even to give me a heads up in advance, when he knew I was going to do something wrong, so I could correct course before I made the mistake and embarrass myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5210.414s">[Bears]</a>: That's my personal thing to say about having Councilor Knight sitting next to me for my first four years on this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5216.98s">[Bears]</a>: But in addition to being a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5222.301s">[Bears]</a>: great colleague.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5224.682s">[Bears]</a>: He's incredibly devoted to this city and to the institution of the Medford City Council in a way that I hope that I can at least take a piece of and continue into the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5238.205s">[Bears]</a>: He knows not just the history of the council since he's been on it, but the history of the council before that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5244.171s">[Bears]</a>: He deeply cares about the city of Medford and seeing it go in the right direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5250.213s">[Bears]</a>: And he is nothing if not persistent and passionate in that cause.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5256.175s">[Bears]</a>: Similarly to Councilor Caraviello, Councilor Knight,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5261.858s">[Bears]</a>: is a father and he has spent many nights away from his family in this chamber serving the people of Medford when he may, at least maybe some of the time, would have wanted to be there with his family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5275.584s">[Bears]</a>: And that sacrifice does not go unnoticed and unremarked this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5283.26s">[Bears]</a>: He's got a legal mind for the state laws and the city ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5287.602s">[Bears]</a>: He always brings up that subtle point of procedure or the rules or the court precedent for us to consider.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5297.947s">[Bears]</a>: And he always wants to make sure that we're dotting our I's and crossing our T's so that when we pass things as this council, that they are enduring and that they live in the history of our city for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5310.272s">[Bears]</a>: And I have appreciated<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5312.552s">[Bears]</a>: learning as much as I can from him in the time that I've been able to sit next to him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5316.593s">[Bears]</a>: So I just want to thank you, Councilor Knight, for your service to the city and for what you've been able to share with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6711.446s">[Bears]</a>: And I want to note for the record, you will get your chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6716.569s">[Bears]</a>: You will get your chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6722.271s">[Bears]</a>: The only Councilor to ever get a chair and a clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6755.252s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6757.714s">[Bears]</a>: It has been noted multiple times on what remains of the public discourse of the city that I only got the most votes in the last election because you didn't run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6769.939s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6770.72s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know who the anonymous commenters are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6773.181s">[Bears]</a>: If they are you, I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6775.522s">[Bears]</a>: But I really cannot begin to talk about what it's meant to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6783.248s">[Bears]</a>: serve with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6784.529s">[Bears]</a>: We ran together in our first campaign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6788.312s">[Bears]</a>: We got elected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6791.514s">[Bears]</a>: We came onto this council in January 2020.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6796.718s">[Bears]</a>: And, you know, I think all of the things, the kind things that have been said about Councilor Caraviello, Councilor Knight, Councilor Marks two years ago, and also some of the funny ones, we experienced them directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6811.168s">[Bears]</a>: We experienced<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6813.186s">[Bears]</a>: the very specific legalisms of Councilor Knight, the history and the knowledge of Councilor Caraviello, the history and the knowledge and loud speaking of Councilor Marks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6824.93s">[Bears]</a>: And we experienced it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6826.891s">[Bears]</a>: And I don't know that if I had been elected just on my own without having you been elected alongside me, that I would have handled it a quarter as well as I was able to sharing that experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6840.315s">[Bears]</a>: those first few months, and what am I kidding, those first two years, without being able to serve alongside you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6848.792s">[Bears]</a>: You are incredibly devoted to this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6851.574s">[Bears]</a>: You came to the city and you made it your home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6853.696s">[Bears]</a>: And you said, if I'm going to make this my home, I want to make it better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6856.618s">[Bears]</a>: And I want to devote my time to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6859.201s">[Bears]</a>: You have devoted immense time to this council, to your colleagues, to the pursuit of bold ideas,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6872.131s">[Bears]</a>: ideas that we hadn't tried before, ideas that had been put on the table and hadn't made their way through the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6878.935s">[Bears]</a>: And we've accomplished a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6880.836s">[Bears]</a>: And you've accomplished a lot over the past four years, I think, especially to note that you've served four years, but two of those as president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6891.663s">[Bears]</a>: is important to note as well, that you have led this council this term with aplomb.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6896.665s">[Bears]</a>: We have accomplished an incredible amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6898.647s">[Bears]</a>: We have been an incredibly civil council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6901.568s">[Bears]</a>: I think if we go back and look at the TV3 records, only 5% to 10% of the time will we have been making donkeys out of ourselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6910.093s">[Bears]</a>: And I think that's a testament to state leadership and leadership that brings our focus back to the issues at hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6919.859s">[Bears]</a>: I have been very lucky to serve with you, and I am not sure what it's going to mean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6927.381s">[Bears]</a>: As Councilor Scarapelli noted, or President Zagreb, I don't know what it means to be a Councilor without President Nicole Morell, Councilor Nicole Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6936.524s">[Bears]</a>: While I invite all of my former colleagues to call me and tell me what I'm doing wrong, if you all do it at the same time, I'm gonna take her call first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6945.472s">[Bears]</a>: So, thank you, thank you, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6949.115s">[Bears]</a>: And I hope that we'll be able to pull you back in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8057.211s">[Bears]</a>: Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8058.912s">[Bears]</a>: I just want to add Councilor Mark's remarks to the record about how hard elected officials work and how much they deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8565.646s">[Bears]</a>: My bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=149.171s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=151.192s">[Bears]</a>: I just think it might be helpful, I know this is kind of more for specific questions, but if possible, if Attorneys Everett and or Stein could give a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=161.892s">[Bears]</a>: general framework of what state law is around private ways and how that impacts the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=166.273s">[Bears]</a>: I think that would be a good starting point just to understand maybe what we can do, what we can't do, and then what is more within our discretion as a city by policy or ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1602.049s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1605.043s">[Bears]</a>: I had two questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1605.924s">[Bears]</a>: One was along those lines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1608.265s">[Bears]</a>: So it sounds like we're going to have a website where people can go, if I live on a private way, here's the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1615.029s">[Bears]</a>: This is what the city does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1615.95s">[Bears]</a>: This is what the city doesn't do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1617.951s">[Bears]</a>: Those are the expectations I should have for service provision on a private way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1634.448s">[Bears]</a>: I think that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1635.209s">[Bears]</a>: I think it'd be great to put links to the different various meetings that you mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1639.474s">[Bears]</a>: I know police have had some engineering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1641.656s">[Bears]</a>: We've had a few.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1642.397s">[Bears]</a>: I think linking out those would be great on that website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1646.501s">[Bears]</a>: To Councilor Karibello's point, would maybe a one-page version of that eventually be mailed out to all the private residents that we have, that we know of?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1656.178s">[Bears]</a>: I think we can keep it on the table and talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1669.451s">[Bears]</a>: Okay, good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1670.312s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I think that would be, I do agree that that would be good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1673.135s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, you know, it's not going to reach everybody even.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1676.34s">[Bears]</a>: if we do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1677.141s">[Bears]</a>: But I think there's some value there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1683.126s">[Bears]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1691.413s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1691.694s">[Bears]</a>: And I think that's really the key thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1693.335s">[Bears]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1693.715s">[Bears]</a>: It's what are the expectations of the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1697.213s">[Bears]</a>: who are purchasing properties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1698.894s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, obviously you have people who live on the properties as Councilor Caraviello said for a very long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1704.496s">[Bears]</a>: And that's one thing, but as properties turn over, I think it's important for residents or future residents who are purchasing those properties to understand that you're not getting the same level of service that you're getting on a public way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1717.842s">[Bears]</a>: And I understand the argument, everyone pays the same taxes, everyone should get the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1721.704s">[Bears]</a>: I live on a state road, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1724.264s">[Bears]</a>: There's a lot of state roads in the city where we don't get the same level of service or comparable services as people on city roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1734.339s">[Bears]</a>: I actually have a specific gripe about big sweep that I'm going to come to you with later, which is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1740.408s">[Bears]</a>: My zone and the DCR zone keep getting scheduled at the same time in the fall, so there's nowhere to park anywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1748.757s">[Bears]</a>: And it's not just for me, but for the whole neighborhood, because I know the main idea of it is we don't do the main roads, we're doing the side roads, so people can move to the main roads and then move back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1757.466s">[Bears]</a>: But I think that's just a great example of there are disparate levels of service because of who has jurisdiction over certain ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1764.989s">[Bears]</a>: And there's basically three levels of jurisdiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1767.15s">[Bears]</a>: There's a lot of city-controlled public ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1769.671s">[Bears]</a>: There are state-controlled public ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1771.192s">[Bears]</a>: And then there are private ways, which are, as our attorneys have noted, controlled by the abutters of those ways, the people who live on those ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2274.122s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2277.284s">[Bears]</a>: Just in terms of the cost, I just, you know, since we talked about this last October, I want to just bring it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2282.546s">[Bears]</a>: I think we're talking at least a couple miles of private ways in terms of length, but I think the number that we talked about was if not tens of millions, hundreds of millions of dollars would be needed to bring all the private ways up to the state necessary to be accepted by the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2331.611s">[Bears]</a>: You know, I think, too, in terms of things that could maybe go and I don't want to overload now this website that, you know, will eventually be created this page on the website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2341.957s">[Bears]</a>: But I think also some sort of link to this is how you can organize your neighbors to try to bring your<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2348.542s">[Bears]</a>: street up to the level, you know, if they want to spend the money so that they don't have to be responsible for it in the future, it seems like that may be the direction that maybe some folks are going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2359.734s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know if you'd ever get everybody on the street to agree, but it does seem like, given all of the discussion around this, that it could be possible for residents to organize themselves and pitch in the money to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2372.386s">[Bears]</a>: bring streets up to the standard to be accepted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2375.287s">[Bears]</a>: And then once we accepted them, then they would be public ways and then they would be streets that would be invested in by with public money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2381.991s">[Bears]</a>: But I think that that kind of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2384.457s">[Bears]</a>: resource, just making sure that resource is available would be good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2408.911s">[Bears]</a>: But even just those three bullet points that you just said, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2411.332s">[Bears]</a>: If you want to do this, you're going to need to organize your neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2414.274s">[Bears]</a>: You're going to probably need an attorney.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2415.775s">[Bears]</a>: You're going to need to raise funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2418.156s">[Bears]</a>: I think just making it clear what the process is, if folks ever want to go down that road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2424.579s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2426.94s">[Bears]</a>: And speaking of that, I think I have a question for Attorneys Everett and Stein, which is just how does the subdivision control law, or I don't know the exact term,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2438.786s">[Bears]</a>: play into what the city can do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2441.309s">[Bears]</a>: Because it seems to me that there, you know, in certain neighborhoods, there were a lot of subdivisions and that's why a lot of our private ways were created.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2448.794s">[Bears]</a>: And I was just wondering if that plays any specific legal role differently than the parts of mass general law that we've already talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2491.34s">[Bears]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2491.841s">[Bears]</a>: On that front, does the city have the ability to require that private ways built through the subdivision process be built to the standard that they could be accepted as public ways?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2530.612s">[Bears]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2536.538s">[Bears]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2536.838s">[Bears]</a>: That makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2537.358s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, it, there's not much land left to be subdivided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2539.46s">[Bears]</a>: So I don't think it's going to be a huge problem, but it does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2594.166s">[Bears]</a>: And it sounds to me, Tim, like you're saying that the subdivision rules and regulations meet the standards for acceptance for the public way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2615.753s">[Bears]</a>: Right, but we're not allowing people to subdivide and build substandard private ways at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2627.456s">[Bears]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2628.296s">[Bears]</a>: Because I just think, you know, obviously the last thing we want to be doing is compounding the mistakes that have, you know, not that it's the mistakes of any of us, it's mostly mistakes made by people who made choices 100 or 50 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2640.539s">[Bears]</a>: We certainly don't want to keep doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2665.229s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2667.375s">[Bears]</a>: Interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2668.116s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2668.816s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=3007.1s">[Bears]</a>: Just want to say thank you to attorneys Everett and Stein as well as Commissioner McGibbon for the meeting and to my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=3012.302s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=106.962s">[Bears]</a>: Motion to suspend the rules to take public participation and papers under suspension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1264.053s">[Bears]</a>: No it wasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1264.853s">[Bears]</a>: It was four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1269.475s">[Bears]</a>: It compounds, it's compound interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1271.175s">[Bears]</a>: That's why it's more than 6%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1886.232s">[Bears]</a>: Right, we had some specific things that came through on raises that we were able to dispute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1890.355s">[Bears]</a>: We got 30 things put before us and we had employees in the city saying, and by the way, a majority of the positions in that were not department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1898.42s">[Bears]</a>: They're just non-union people who are not department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1901.382s">[Bears]</a>: And they have, you know, some of these people are making 60, $65,000 a year also saying to me, I can't afford XYZ and I need this raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1909.988s">[Bears]</a>: And what I had before me, what we had before us was a paper that said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1914.278s">[Bears]</a>: that said you can give some people something or you can give no one anything and it's going to help nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1919.804s">[Bears]</a>: I'm what you came before us I think two two meetings ago, and we were sitting here and you said vote down the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1925.631s">[Bears]</a>: And I said to you guys, I said, it's not going to get us anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1929.673s">[Bears]</a>: It's not gonna get us anything because it's not, we've threatened it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1932.534s">[Bears]</a>: We've threatened a million things over and over again to vote down this, to vote down that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1936.776s">[Bears]</a>: We voted down 16 of the 18 things and it hasn't made a single difference in the negotiations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1941.958s">[Bears]</a>: I tried to attend the negotiations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1943.499s">[Bears]</a>: I wasn't allowed to attend the negotiations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1945.699s">[Bears]</a>: And I said before you and got quite a bit of pushback from the mayor's office that I would 100% be on the picket line for a strike because I think four years of no contract is ridiculous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1955.443s">[Bears]</a>: And I think that the negotiations aren't being done in the way that I would wanna do them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1961.146s">[Bears]</a>: And that's, you know, one of the reasons I wanted to sit down was to see it for myself and confirm that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1965.57s">[Bears]</a>: Now, the choices that I have before me, right, and we've had conversations about this here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1972.855s">[Bears]</a>: I want to open up the budget process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1975.457s">[Bears]</a>: I want to see more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1977.038s">[Bears]</a>: I want us to be able to have real discussions here on this council about how we move forward, about how we fund staff, about how we fund contracts, because that's the purview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1985.084s">[Bears]</a>: That's as far as we can go here in the purview here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1987.026s">[Bears]</a>: We can't negotiate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1988.647s">[Bears]</a>: the contracts and we can't, by all the times that we've tried and all the ways that we've tried, have had no impact on the negotiations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1995.99s">[Bears]</a>: And when the decision or the question is before us to tell people they're not going to get raises because other people didn't get raises, or effectively shut down the city because people didn't get raises, I have to weigh the harm of that too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2008.936s">[Bears]</a>: And when I know that those decisions are going to be incredibly harmful, and we're not going to get anything anyway, because we're just going to get waited out,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2016.567s">[Bears]</a>: I have to try to find something that's gonna improve the process in the future because better or worse, it seems that this is how it's been going for four years and the voters could make the same choice again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2030.086s">[Bears]</a>: And so it's an incredibly difficult position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2032.488s">[Bears]</a>: I work in labor every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2034.55s">[Bears]</a>: I work in an organization where I've worked for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2037.393s">[Bears]</a>: I've been a union member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2039.155s">[Bears]</a>: I have never seen a negotiation go this long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2041.357s">[Bears]</a>: I've advocated for changes to state law to basically put a shot clock on public sector negotiations because they shouldn't be allowed to drag out this long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2050.971s">[Bears]</a>: And I'm a supporter of the public employee right to strike because I think that's a way to force people to the table when you don't feel like they're negotiating in good faith.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2057.937s">[Bears]</a>: All I know here is that when we say no to stuff about, because it's about the labor relations piece of things, it doesn't impact the negotiations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2066.363s">[Bears]</a>: And so that's how I think about these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2070.326s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just trying to work as best as I can to make as much progress, to have the information and the open public discussions<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2079.033s">[Bears]</a>: so that voters are informed and educated about what the budget looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2082.737s">[Bears]</a>: And I don't think that voting down these non-union raises would have helped the negotiations, because we voted down 15 raises before that didn't help the negotiations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2090.946s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think voting down the budget is going to help the negotiations, because we voted down a bunch of money papers and we voted down the budget last year and it didn't help the negotiations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2099.295s">[Bears]</a>: So I'm taking a different strategy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2101.256s">[Bears]</a>: My question really is what's the strategy, I'd be happy to sit down and talk through the strategic approach and see how we can be helpful and try new things because what we're being asked, and you haven't necessarily made the explicit asked but the ideas of just voting down non union raises are voting down the budget and voting down money papers haven't been effective, and I can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2120.18s">[Bears]</a>: repeat an ineffective strategy because it may make us feel better that we said no and stood up to something, but if we still get nothing at the end and somebody else gets hurt, it's just not, that's not fair either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2133.205s">[Bears]</a>: So I hear how much, I think you should get a market adjustment and a raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2139.509s">[Bears]</a>: Like that's what I think the negotiation should be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2142.01s">[Bears]</a>: I can't even sit in and certainly I'm not on the other side of the table for me to actually negotiate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2147.071s">[Bears]</a>: So it's a bad situation when it comes to the contracts and there are steps, there are different things that I would like to see tried that maybe could make movement on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2159.814s">[Bears]</a>: But I don't think that voting down the budget or voting down other people's raises is gonna do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3949.431s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3950.431s">[Bears]</a>: I think my fellow councilors have spoken well, and the resolution speaks well, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3957.179s">[Bears]</a>: You know, I was driving home from work the other day last week and you listen to a story and you listen to these parents and this kid in Texas, and I know it's not here, I know it's far away, but it's here, being forced to move, leave their home, leave their friends, leave their jobs, because their state says, we're not gonna let you get the medical treatment that your doctor<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3987.054s">[Bears]</a>: and your family and you want to make sure that you are healthy and safe and living comfortably in your own body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3998.148s">[Bears]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4000.649s">[Bears]</a>: It's just awful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4002.81s">[Bears]</a>: And so anything that we can do to say that that's not what we're going to do here, I think is very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4010.612s">[Bears]</a>: I was a lot worse when I was listening to the story, so I apologize for getting emotional, but I just think that's what this is really about, saying that here we're going to let people do what they need to do to be comfortable with who they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4021.735s">[Bears]</a>: That's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4022.876s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8334.752s">[Bears]</a>: You did recognize me earlier when I raised my hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8338.334s">[Bears]</a>: Hi, Cathy, how are you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8343.816s">[Bears]</a>: I have two questions just further on the pest control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8349.642s">[Bears]</a>: it sounded like you're going to follow the road control ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8353.283s">[Bears]</a>: They have a vendor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8354.083s">[Bears]</a>: The vendor is going to come out monthly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8355.284s">[Bears]</a>: If there are issues, they are going to increase the frequency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8359.485s">[Bears]</a>: And then also that it's going to be a requirement of the staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8361.625s">[Bears]</a>: And this is the part that I'm sorry, I forgot your name, but you may be able to answer this, that at several points during the day, the crew is going to go across the whole site and clean the whole site for waste.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8373.649s">[Bears]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8374.589s">[Bears]</a>: That's correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8375.769s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8377.29s">[Bears]</a>: That sounds<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8380.448s">[Bears]</a>: I think I'm just going to once we get to the point suggest that we had one more condition, which is that your pest control vendor submits quarterly reports to the health department about the condition of the property, and that would allow our health department to actually make sure that you're following through on what you've committed to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8397.318s">[Bears]</a>: Okay, and I had one other question that may be for the transportation folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8404.883s">[Bears]</a>: It sounds like the on site piece<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8409.051s">[Bears]</a>: As Councilor Scarpelli said seems to be reasonable but I think there's a concern that a resident has raised here, and that I've actually experienced many times about the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8419.892s">[Bears]</a>: when you're exiting Riverside Plaza onto Riverside Avenue, in between basically your site and the Panera Bread site, there's massive traffic backups all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8431.338s">[Bears]</a>: Folks trying to turn left can't get out, the right is just constantly backed up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8435.861s">[Bears]</a>: It seems to me the only mitigation in here is we're gonna repaint the don't block the box, which nobody follows anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8441.924s">[Bears]</a>: And I'm just, is there more mitigation that I'm missing or is there, that's my one concern about the traffic here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8632.324s">[Bears]</a>: That sounds like some progress, but do you think it would be possible to do additional wayfinding?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8639.83s">[Bears]</a>: So I guess I'll just get up and point to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8645.37s">[Bears]</a>: here when people are actually making the decision to go into that egress or to go somewhere else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8692.645s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I think that's gonna be key.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8694.807s">[Bears]</a>: I understand the structural limitations of the area, but redirecting traffic away from that egress point is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8702.672s">[Bears]</a>: It sounds like there's also gonna be some improvements to try to stop blocking the egress point, and we'll see how they go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8707.855s">[Bears]</a>: But yeah, I'm glad you brought up that this is happening in concert with the city resurfacing of that stretch of Riverside Avenue, because I think that's important to factor in here, too, that there's gonna be new pavement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8719.904s">[Bears]</a>: And yeah, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8722.691s">[Bears]</a>: That's all I have for now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8723.311s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8738.442s">[Bears]</a>: So it's going, it's all the way from commercial, I'm sorry, not commercial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8742.645s">[Bears]</a>: I think it's all the way from like hall all the way down to, to the Felsway, almost all the way to Locust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9454.028s">[Bears]</a>: Kathy, when we say that, I think we're getting a little confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9456.009s">[Bears]</a>: You mean the restaurant receiving deliveries of supplies?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9460.61s">[Bears]</a>: Not like delivery orders going out to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9585.639s">[Bears]</a>: Any other questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9587.0s">[Bears]</a>: Just the other one, I think, Kathy, was the sealing of the bins for rodent control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9615.843s">[Bears]</a>: And that includes any barrels that may be outside?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9620.842s">[Bears]</a>: Okay, those are, are they, if you could just come to the microphone, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9665.818s">[Bears]</a>: Okay, so so like even like a barrel out by the front door is as closing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9709.555s">[Bears]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9709.815s">[Bears]</a>: And I guess I'm just asking like, you know, you may see on the sidewalk like, I mean, this is Medford we have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9715.879s">[Bears]</a>: trash bins and the door, you open the door you put something in you close it versus you may have a trash bin where there's like an open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9736.572s">[Bears]</a>: We will do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9738.814s">[Bears]</a>: For information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9739.834s">[Bears]</a>: Councilman, what time is trash pickup normal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9756.291s">[Bears]</a>: With the passage of an extended hours permit, could the trash pickup extend to the extended hours that were approved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9768.682s">[Bears]</a>: because I'd like to put some restrictions around when the trash can be picked up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9771.523s">[Bears]</a>: If in fact the permit's going to pass, it's going to allow them to operate to this late an hour in a residential neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9775.745s">[Bears]</a>: Madam President, the last thing we want to hear is dumpsters banging and smashing in the neighborhood while people are sleeping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9780.307s">[Bears]</a>: Right, Mrs. Fiorello?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9855.539s">[Bears]</a>: You're not saying approve pending, you're saying you'd like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9922.974s">[Bears]</a>: No, I just, I think we're going to, we've had a robust discussion tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9927.617s">[Bears]</a>: I think there's a lot of conditions we're going to add to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9930.619s">[Bears]</a>: I think all that's going to happen if we delay till July is that we're going to have to have the conversation again, and we're not going to remember all the details to the level that we have the details now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9941.826s">[Bears]</a>: So I'm personally comfortable after we had conditions moving forward, approving with conditions pending the six day waiting period, like we have for most of the other special permits we've considered in the past year and a half.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9976.399s">[Bears]</a>: Procedurally, we actually have to have several, we have to have two months to vote on the special permits and we have to go on a site plan review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9981.641s">[Bears]</a>: So it's- Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10002.301s">[Bears]</a>: So what I'm hearing is there's a motion to approve the special permits for drive-through use and the extended hours with the conditions of, did you say 90 day review?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10015.673s">[Bears]</a>: 30, 60 and 90 day review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10019.136s">[Bears]</a>: From the date of opening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10020.637s">[Bears]</a>: From the date of opening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10114.836s">[Bears]</a>: Special permits for the drive-throughs and the extended hours of operation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10144.655s">[Bears]</a>: It would also mean none of the conditions that have been negotiated and discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10157.051s">[Bears]</a>: Most of the conditions should go on the site plan review, not on the special permits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10160.512s">[Bears]</a>: I just wanted to clarify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10163.753s">[Bears]</a>: Because the site plan review is more expansive, it allows for more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10167.813s">[Bears]</a>: And also that's where the CDB conditions come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10174.375s">[Bears]</a>: That's the zoning relief is actually the site plan review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10176.595s">[Bears]</a>: The special permits are just limited to drive through and the hours of operation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10181.417s">[Bears]</a>: All the site plan stuff,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10184.332s">[Bears]</a>: conditions of the traffic, the HVAC baffles, which I got from Councilor Scarpelli, no idling during deliveries, basically under the transportation, road mitigation, or the other conditions that we've discussed, sound and noise, would be under site plan review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10204.233s">[Bears]</a>: But site plan review isn't considered a special permit, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10271.667s">[Bears]</a>: I would also add that the petitioner has said verbally that they agreed to all the conditions we've suggested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10459.994s">[Bears]</a>: It's the special permit for drive-through and extended hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10462.496s">[Bears]</a>: And the conditions are that the permits go with the business, not the license, and that they get 30, 60 and 90 day review from opening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10469.773s">[Bears]</a>: and then the CD board stuff and the off street loading and all the conditions we've done tonight, that's gonna be on the next vote for the site plan review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10620.943s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, so it should be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10624.133s">[Bears]</a>: Motion to approve the special permit for drive-thru and the permit go with the business of the license and there'll be 30, 60, 90 day review from opening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10687.538s">[Bears]</a>: Sure, we're gonna just have to vote the city board conditions again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10690.76s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10694.443s">[Bears]</a>: Just yeah, it's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10810.388s">[Bears]</a>: Motion to approve the site plan review with the waiver of off street loading requirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10851.142s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10851.242s">[Bears]</a>: Okay, it should be one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10853.223s">[Bears]</a>: Technically it needs to be one thing, but that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10879.482s">[Bears]</a>: Whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10879.883s">[Bears]</a>: It has to be, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10881.104s">[Bears]</a>: I think it's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10881.844s">[Bears]</a>: It's on one paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10882.505s">[Bears]</a>: It'll be fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10897.447s">[Bears]</a>: I have a motion from already voted on half the special permits, so we can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10919.987s">[Bears]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11006.977s">[Bears]</a>: So if we- Yes, I haven't finished making my motion yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11009.538s">[Bears]</a>: I was asked to wait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11010.238s">[Bears]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11011.079s">[Bears]</a>: What's the sufficiency of the vote?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11012.339s">[Bears]</a>: The five or the four?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11052.391s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, to approve the site plan review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11055.502s">[Bears]</a>: including the four conditions from the Community Development Board letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11059.124s">[Bears]</a>: And also I believe I have all the conditions the council put forward, which were to require sealed trash receptacles for customer use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11069.929s">[Bears]</a>: I can just let me know when I can go to the next one, Mr. Clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11076.592s">[Bears]</a>: Put in baffles for the HVAC system to soundproof the system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11093.257s">[Bears]</a>: Disallow idling during any deliveries to the facility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11110.082s">[Bears]</a>: Require quarterly reports to the Medford Health Department from the business's pest control vendor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11131.619s">[Bears]</a>: And Councilor Caraviello if I'm correct you wanted to route the delivery trucks, you wanted to route the delivery trucks down commercial street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11140.35s">[Bears]</a>: Explore different routing options for delivery trucks including commercial street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11161.638s">[Bears]</a>: All good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12165.046s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President, through extensive discussions between the mayor and council leadership, I believe we were able to reach an agreement that makes progress on our goal for a better budget process and enables us to move forward and create a plan to fix the city's biggest challenges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12179.214s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks to that agreement, I'm able to move ahead and support the fiscal 24 budget as amended to include increases to the schools library and zoning reform.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12187.338s">[Bears]</a>: We received commitments to create a financial task force with city council members, school committee members and city staff to make a plan to fund the city's major challenges to establish a better budget process based on clear principles of having budget meetings starting in January and February.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12203.482s">[Bears]</a>: A process for the council to submit recommendations to the mayor and receive responses from the mayor prior to the budget being submitted by the mayor, as well as to conduct comprehensive assessments of our operating and capital budget needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12217.52s">[Bears]</a>: We also agreed to explore the use of one time funds for budget planning for assessing our staffing needs and our capital needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12226.822s">[Bears]</a>: And we also agreed to continue discussions to advance the charter amendments approved by this council in some form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12233.164s">[Bears]</a>: I think this agreement leaves much work to do, and I plan to work in good faith to implement it, because I truly believe that if we can get this done, we can build a better future that everyone in our city deserves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12244.808s">[Bears]</a>: That's all I'm going to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12246.649s">[Bears]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12262.93s">[Bears]</a>: When I said Council leadership I meant the President and Vice President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12286.342s">[Bears]</a>: We worked with what this council had passed and tried to reach an agreement to get it done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12367.395s">[Bears]</a>: I just said it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12399.025s">[Bears]</a>: We had a discussion with the mayor and we created an agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12401.567s">[Bears]</a>: So personally, you had a discussion with the mayor and you had an agreement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12404.189s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12404.91s">[Bears]</a>: And it was based on the seven budget meetings we had, what everybody's asked for, and that we thought that we would get the best of possible of what everybody has said they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12425.106s">[Bears]</a>: Because of the open meeting law, we are unable to talk to all of you at once, it's against the law, right, so you elected us as your council leadership, if you would like to elect a different leadership that's up to you, Matt point of information Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12515.253s">[Bears]</a>: Say it again, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12528.804s">[Bears]</a>: I spoke to Councilor Tseng about a plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12530.366s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12534.129s">[Bears]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12536.091s">[Bears]</a>: Because once I talked about it, once President Morell talks about it, and once I talked about Councilor Tseng that's three, if I talked to anyone else, that's four and it's violating the open meeting law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12544.698s">[Bears]</a>: It's a violation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12545.398s">[Bears]</a>: Why do you have a meeting then, Zach?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12600.664s">[Bears]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12601.745s">[Bears]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12602.065s">[Bears]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12602.465s">[Bears]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12624.37s">[Bears]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13233.328s">[Bears]</a>: The first opportunity that I had to share with all councilors what this was, was when this paper came up on the agenda 15 minutes ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13244.055s">[Bears]</a>: I was the first person to speak and I said, these are the details.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13247.998s">[Bears]</a>: That was the first opportunity, the way the law works, that I can share with everybody what we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13255.363s">[Bears]</a>: That's what I did, first opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13257.965s">[Bears]</a>: Literally the first one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13260.725s">[Bears]</a>: The council leadership team, we had positions on the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13264.108s">[Bears]</a>: It was clear to the mayor that there was Councilors that couldn't support the budget, and she was willing to negotiate something with the President and the Vice President to try to represent the interests of everything we've talked about for the last month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13277.882s">[Bears]</a>: So we did that, and then at the first opportunity in open session to put it forward and tell you what we did, we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13284.941s">[Bears]</a>: So I don't want to hear fraudulent and I don't want to hear dictatorship and I don't want to hear horrible things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13291.684s">[Bears]</a>: I understand that it feels bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13293.144s">[Bears]</a>: I have felt very bad on this council many times when I was not in the leadership, when the leadership made decisions that I didn't like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13301.668s">[Bears]</a>: And when the leadership ruled my papers out of order and many other things where I wasn't a good, there was no good faith.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13307.01s">[Bears]</a>: There was nothing, there was no even-<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13314.873s">[Bears]</a>: If you're interested in a task force that includes us in making decisions about the high school and the fire headquarters and the streets and sidewalks and staffing, or if you're interested in a process where we get to meet six months earlier and get quarterly meetings with the finance department and where we get options to bring our recommendations to her next time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13391.686s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just saying, all the things we asked for is what we were able to negotiate the first opportunity in public session I had to bring it to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13398.952s">[Bears]</a>: I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13399.952s">[Bears]</a>: I gave you a heads up before the meeting, because as a courtesy, because it's the first time I saw you after we had details worked out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13408.43s">[Bears]</a>: It's the best I could do under the very difficult situation we were in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13411.992s">[Bears]</a>: The alternative was we get nothing, we vote down the budget, and exactly what happened last year happens again, which is who the heck knows?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13420.676s">[Bears]</a>: So there's a lot here that's good that we all asked for, and I brought it to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14774.714s">[Bears]</a>: It's just clear that sucks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15130.834s">[Bears]</a>: I'm trying to keep it to two sentences after this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15135.956s">[Bears]</a>: The answers to the questions that we asked the administration have come back to us by email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15139.897s">[Bears]</a>: If we read the answers, they show that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15143.186s">[Bears]</a>: The administration has said that ClearGov is a bad software and that the actual numbers for expenditures in ClearGov are not reliable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15149.889s">[Bears]</a>: That's one of the issues that we had around the surplus question that I asked you at the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15153.931s">[Bears]</a>: So there's inaccurate, let's not dodge it, Rick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15158.634s">[Bears]</a>: There's inaccurate information in ClearGov about actual expenditures that don't reflect the real actuals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15163.856s">[Bears]</a>: That was sent to us weeks ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15165.817s">[Bears]</a>: We've had that information for weeks and the question and answers that have been sent to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15169.898s">[Bears]</a>: I'm concerned about next year's budget and the cliff, which is why we now work together to get a task force and a budget process starting in January so that we open the whole thing up and have these questions and discussions and the information that we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15184.327s">[Bears]</a>: And it's a public commitment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15185.888s">[Bears]</a>: And you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15187.489s">[Bears]</a>: That's what we needed to get there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15188.85s">[Bears]</a>: So I'm gonna move to end debate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15190.791s">[Bears]</a>: I'm moving to end debate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15307.963s">[Bears]</a>: Could one of you just say that the numbers that for actual expenditures in ClearGov, they are not updated regularly and not correct the correct numbers in ClearGov for the actual expenditures for several of the recent fiscal years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15712.657s">[Bears]</a>: Again, on all of this, like, I think this goes back to what we were talking about at the beginning of this process and what we've talked about with your office, which is like your staffs running around you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15722.787s">[Bears]</a>: So one of the reasons we wanted that money for budget planning and it's one reason I'm glad we're going to explore it, and what we've discussed because it seems to me there just wasn't enough time to get the right figures into clear gov about actual expenditures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15735.04s">[Bears]</a>: And that that seems to be the issue or that this clear gov system didn't make it easy enough to do it and it wasn't a priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15741.125s">[Bears]</a>: And I think that's created an information gap here where people think one thing and it's not the real numbers because numbers were put out that are not the correct numbers for whatever reason, either capacity or the technology itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15753.676s">[Bears]</a>: And I think you know something for me, it would be really good to make sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15759.229s">[Bears]</a>: We update the clear gov budgets to have the correct actuals that we have up to date for prior fiscal years for the end of fiscal 23, and then we go into fiscal 24 there's a clear note on there somewhere that says, FY 24 actuals are not complete because the year is not complete yet and we will update them after June 30, because there's this information that went out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15778.03s">[Bears]</a>: that was not complete and not accurate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15779.711s">[Bears]</a>: And it's created a disagreement here about what the actual numbers are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15784.395s">[Bears]</a>: Now, I've gotten other versions of actuals from you guys in different documents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15788.299s">[Bears]</a>: So I know that's how I knew what was in ClearGov was not the actual actuals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15792.502s">[Bears]</a>: It's not the actuals from the ACFR.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15793.863s">[Bears]</a>: It's not the actuals from the actual spreadsheets that you've sent over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15797.686s">[Bears]</a>: So I know ClearGov is not a reliable source for those pieces of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15803.771s">[Bears]</a>: So, again, I just think that's something going forward that we wouldn't have had just 3540 minutes of confusion and debate about what the city has actually spent over the last three fiscal years if numbers hadn't been released that were not the correct numbers, and so I just wanted to say that, for the record, on the rest of this I've already made my motion, which is I think we've discussed this, if there are further questions, you know, clearly there was not enough of a supermajority to support the motion and debate but I'm voting on voting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15833.217s">[Bears]</a>: my concerns about the future are very real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15835.478s">[Bears]</a>: That's why it's important to me that we're going to have a task force and an improved budget process in the next budget so that we can actually answer these questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15843.42s">[Bears]</a>: That's why it's important to me that actual information goes out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15847.1s">[Bears]</a>: And quite frankly, you know, there's a public commitment here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15852.002s">[Bears]</a>: And if<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15855.208s">[Bears]</a>: If assertions are true that someone wants to go back on that commitment, I'm sure that would be great fodder for the season that is coming up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15861.453s">[Bears]</a>: Everything that we asked for last- George, everything we asked for- George.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15866.356s">[Bears]</a>: Everything we- Everything we asked for in the last budget is still in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15874.182s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, it is, George.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15876.104s">[Bears]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15876.664s">[Bears]</a>: I am very frustrated that the hiring didn't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15880.707s">[Bears]</a>: I'm very frustrated that-<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15884.833s">[Bears]</a>: It's all in the budget still.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15886.234s">[Bears]</a>: We never want it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15891.917s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just saying everything that we got last year is still in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15896.639s">[Bears]</a>: If you have a solicitor that wants to work here, that's another story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17085.344s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17087.644s">[Bears]</a>: The communication we got from the chief of staff is actually removing, the mayor's amended to remove the indirect transfer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17094.225s">[Bears]</a>: So there's, we can't do that, but she has done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17097.906s">[Bears]</a>: And I would also move to sever the two votes one to vote on the water and sewer budget and one to vote on the retained earnings transfer promotion advice was embarrassed to sever the two votes to separate the water and sewer budget from the retained earnings transfer second by<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17364.738s">[Bears]</a>: that's the truck that we discussed during the electrical budget, and that's why it's coming from keep free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17391.495s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17392.575s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17435.685s">[Bears]</a>: Motion to waive the reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17439.167s">[Bears]</a>: May you refer to the Committee of the Whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17462.237s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17465.599s">[Bears]</a>: Given where we're at at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17470.589s">[Bears]</a>: basically, once June 30th passes, we're not gonna have access to any of our free cash until DLS certifies free cash, so that could, last year it was all the way till March, so we would not be able to make any appropriations from free cash between July 1st and next March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17487.032s">[Bears]</a>: Creating a stabilization fund would mean that we would have access to some of our reserve funding in case it is needed for an emergency or for an unexpected use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17495.754s">[Bears]</a>: I think it would be good to have some availability for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17499.71s">[Bears]</a>: and that's what passing this would get us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17501.531s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17566.26s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you Councilor Knight for your support for the better budget plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17569.483s">[Bears]</a>: Don't get me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17728.954s">[Bears]</a>: Would quite frankly, that was my argument when it was first proposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17736.639s">[Bears]</a>: So fair argument.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17738.92s">[Bears]</a>: Um, would folks consider holding a committee of the whole next week and considering moving on this before June 30th so that we could access the free cash funds after we've had a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17760.461s">[Bears]</a>: that's something that you guys could commit to having the necessary parties there to make answer all of our questions so that we could potentially schedule a committee of the whole to discuss it and also potentially a special meeting to approve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17871.512s">[Bears]</a>: It can't be accessed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17933.214s">[Bears]</a>: That doesn't make sense to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17943.462s">[Bears]</a>: Establish the procedures and protocols for drawing funds out of it and the like, and then fund it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18171.024s">[Bears]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18174.966s">[Bears]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=10.315s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=115.504s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=116.406s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you for placing this on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=118.889s">[Bears]</a>: Um, you know, we all know Henry and Evelyn we've worked with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=124.149s">[Bears]</a>: Henry, especially in the government capacity as now our chair of our Elections Commission, but formerly as a leader of the Medford Democratic City Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=135.679s">[Bears]</a>: And we know, I always get calls from him, sometimes during meetings, usually after, to comment on what's going on in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=147.389s">[Bears]</a>: But also in addition to their devotion to Medford,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=152.526s">[Bears]</a>: and our community here in Medford, I think their devotion to the ARC and to people with intellectual and developmental disabilities across the Boston area, across the state is well-known as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=164.388s">[Bears]</a>: And that's not all that either of them do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=166.469s">[Bears]</a>: So I think it's great that they're being honored and I'm glad that we can have a resolution recognizing the great work that both Henry and Evelyn do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=174.27s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=592.396s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=594.437s">[Bears]</a>: We are seeing, and I'm hearing from residents, just the sheer amount of cut-through trips now cutting through on Willis Ave in between Main Street and Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=605.722s">[Bears]</a>: just a high volume of cars, high speed, sometimes such a high volume that it's not high speed, but it is really dangerous for our neighborhood streets to be being used as through ways and thoroughfares.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=620.336s">[Bears]</a>: Residents have had some suggestions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=627.622s">[Bears]</a>: We're working on the microphone system, I swear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=632.162s">[Bears]</a>: But, you know, essentially people are using Willis Ave either instead of using Main Street or using Mystic Ave, they're using it to get through from Main Street to Mystic Ave or Mystic Ave to Main Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=643.153s">[Bears]</a>: So there were some suggestions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=646.316s">[Bears]</a>: A, the residents are interested in what the city's general plan is in the area to have traffic try to stay on streets like Harvard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=657.087s">[Bears]</a>: you know, Hancock and others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=659.994s">[Bears]</a>: I have communicated with the Director of Traffic and Transportation about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=666.196s">[Bears]</a>: And he said that it is a difficult situation, but that he's looking into some of these solutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=672.242s">[Bears]</a>: Additionally, I think design changes like speed tables and potentially other design changes could discourage the cut through traffic and discourage the apps from directing people down those roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=681.911s">[Bears]</a>: So I would ask for my colleagues support for this motion to refer this to the Traffic Commission so they put it on their agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=689.224s">[Bears]</a>: and get back to us and the residents about what our plan is for the area of South Medford that is facing these issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=697.132s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1271.185s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1271.846s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1272.547s">[Bears]</a>: I just wanted to add, uh, that one of the reasons that a resident raises concern with me<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1278.792s">[Bears]</a>: was the kids walking to Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1281.254s">[Bears]</a>: Tuck's school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1281.954s">[Bears]</a>: And then also that I completely agree with my colleagues that this is a citywide issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1287.037s">[Bears]</a>: And it's one of the reasons I asked for a traffic flow study for the whole area is because even if we were to implement this on Willis, maybe it wouldn't work because it would impact other streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1298.144s">[Bears]</a>: So yeah, it's a serious issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1301.146s">[Bears]</a>: And I think it also points me towards<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1305.822s">[Bears]</a>: Some of those improvements that we had heard from the folks who want to develop the large, the combined properties life sciences project on Mystic Ave, potentially some of the improvements to the area's physical infrastructure that they had talked about committing to, that could go to benefit this project, this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1325.435s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1703.907s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1704.987s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello, for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1706.788s">[Bears]</a>: The light sequence is certainly an issue at both of these locations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1711.29s">[Bears]</a>: And I also wonder, you know, I think it would be helpful for DCR to potentially<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1719.511s">[Bears]</a>: look at peak, having a certain sequence for peak hours and then a certain sequence for the rest of the time, you know, that might help to address the backups that are happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1729.875s">[Bears]</a>: Really, you know, I mean, obviously there's traffic and gridlock at many hours of the day these days, but the very serious backups are concentrated to two or three hours in the morning and the evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1740.239s">[Bears]</a>: So I would like to see something like that as well, but I'm not amending this and I second it and I support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1755.19s">[Bears]</a>: Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1757.171s">[Bears]</a>: Motion to take paper 23-419 for third reading and 23-444 under suspension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1865.984s">[Bears]</a>: Motion approves for third reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2417.338s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2418.398s">[Bears]</a>: Um, I think, uh, you know, to Councilors here probably points both of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2424.601s">[Bears]</a>: Number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2425.021s">[Bears]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2425.941s">[Bears]</a>: We've reiterated multiple times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2428.222s">[Bears]</a>: You know that the ballots can't be used, but I actually appreciate bringing up the other issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2433.984s">[Bears]</a>: Um, which was the misprinted ballots because I believe all the ballots had to be reported.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2437.865s">[Bears]</a>: That's a significant cost to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2439.786s">[Bears]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2440.956s">[Bears]</a>: last budget, we were very clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2443.178s">[Bears]</a>: I think all of us on this council that we were last two budgets, but especially last budget that we were uncomfortable with the reductions in the elections department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2452.464s">[Bears]</a>: Under the prior system before we moved to the independent elections commission system, we had as many as five staff working full time on elections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2460.19s">[Bears]</a>: We now have two staff working full time on elections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2463.793s">[Bears]</a>: I believe there's a vacancy that's unfilled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2466.187s">[Bears]</a>: So if that were to be filled, it would be up to three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2469.23s">[Bears]</a>: But that is a significant reduction in staffing, a significant reduction in a second pair of eyes to double check the ballot, a second pair of eyes to be able to supervise the distribution of mail ballots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2480.76s">[Bears]</a>: And I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2482.315s">[Bears]</a>: given the facts on the ground today are the same as the facts on the ground before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2485.819s">[Bears]</a>: You can register later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2487.1s">[Bears]</a>: Eventually, I'm guessing we'll end up with same day registration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2490.083s">[Bears]</a>: We have mail ballots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2490.984s">[Bears]</a>: We have early ballots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2491.985s">[Bears]</a>: We have election day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2493.988s">[Bears]</a>: We have essentially all year elections a lot of the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2496.45s">[Bears]</a>: You know, there's another election in March and there's an election in September and an election in November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2500.234s">[Bears]</a>: So there's going to be four elections in the next 12 months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2504.315s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think that merits a reduction in staff and a reduction in budget for the department that should be handling that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2509.717s">[Bears]</a>: That's something this council has raised for two budget cycles consecutively, and I think we're seeing that it's an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2517.039s">[Bears]</a>: So I hope that in the future budgets that that issue is addressed and the staffing for that department is at least made whole so that there's additional resources and capacity for the administration of elections here in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3206.925s">[Bears]</a>: I don't have answers to all your questions, but- No, no, just the one on the bike path.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3210.268s">[Bears]</a>: On the bike path, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3211.369s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3212.91s">[Bears]</a>: My understanding is that that did go out to bid and is going to be under construction next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3236.818s">[Bears]</a>: I agree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3239.04s">[Bears]</a>: No, I hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3243.862s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3599.815s">[Bears]</a>: I'm done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3600.356s">[Bears]</a>: No, no, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3602.157s">[Bears]</a>: We got to give that back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3603.538s">[Bears]</a>: We got to give it back, Larry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3641.447s">[Bears]</a>: It's real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3644.169s">[Bears]</a>: If it was fake, it would be better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=22.366s">[Bears]</a>: Sorry, vice president bears is present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=24.827s">[Bears]</a>: I'm in the office next door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=25.907s">[Bears]</a>: He's in the office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1431.816s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1434.417s">[Bears]</a>: Emily, just so I can clarify this as well, this is an overlay, so the existing zoning still exists in the area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1444.54s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing the nod is correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1445.68s">[Bears]</a>: And so we, Alicia, if I'm misremembering this, please let me know, but we passed a PDD for the property on Mystic Valley Parkway, or was it just a zoning change?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1465.148s">[Bears]</a>: Muzz zone, right, okay, got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1467.149s">[Bears]</a>: And so, yeah, so I was just noting that some of the properties that you noted<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1472.62s">[Bears]</a>: as more likely to see change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1473.921s">[Bears]</a>: We've actually already seen potential proposals or requests for zoning changes on them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1477.903s">[Bears]</a>: And this is an overlay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1478.904s">[Bears]</a>: It wouldn't change it or affect those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1481.205s">[Bears]</a>: It just allows, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1482.526s">[Bears]</a>: So cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1482.927s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1483.167s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2341.352s">[Bears]</a>: maybe just said a slightly different way, many of these units already exist, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2347.198s">[Bears]</a>: Like that, you know, essentially of that 6,500, I don't know what the number is, and you guys may have calculated, I would bet there's probably a couple, 3,000, maybe even more than that already in that zone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2357.087s">[Bears]</a>: So, yeah, I think that's just a helpful clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2533.936s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks, and not to belabor the point, but Danielle, if you could just explain a little more why do we have to get<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2540.993s">[Bears]</a>: the existing inclusionary zoning reassessed for viability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2545.537s">[Bears]</a>: Is that a condition specifically of the MVTA Communities Act?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2651.306s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2651.726s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, and that I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2653.407s">[Bears]</a>: I've heard of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2654.167s">[Bears]</a>: I've heard of communities using inclusion areas as a barrier to construction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2661.791s">[Bears]</a>: Obviously, there's some political benefits there, maybe in different areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2668.55s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know, it's just, I'm interested to see, I'm interested, I think, as we go through the process in this broader sense of looking at the zoning and aligning with the comprehensive plan, obviously inclusionary is gonna be important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2679.439s">[Bears]</a>: And I'm kind of interested to see what the economic feasibility analysis says, not so much for this purpose, but for that purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2685.405s">[Bears]</a>: So yeah, but thanks for answering the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2706.432s">[Bears]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=0.009s">[Bears]</a>: Good news about the money too, so we'll get there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=3.03s">[Bears]</a>: Before I start, I want to shout out our Council Vice President, Kit Collins, who is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=7.19s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=12.011s">[Bears]</a>: Now, I know everyone's just here to see the giraffes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=15.532s">[Bears]</a>: We're going to do three things before then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=19.393s">[Bears]</a>: First, you're going to listen to me for a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=21.553s">[Bears]</a>: Hopefully you'll donate if you haven't already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=24.414s">[Bears]</a>: And then we're going to take a photo right around here so that we can show everyone how many people are psyched for this campaign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=32.287s">[Bears]</a>: correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=34.068s">[Bears]</a>: It's a beautiful evening to be here with all of you, my neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=37.83s">[Bears]</a>: I want to thank the McGordys for hosting us, and I want to thank everyone for everything that they've done so far to build the foundation of this grassroots campaign to invest in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=51.458s">[Bears]</a>: I want to talk a little bit about why we're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=54.52s">[Bears]</a>: We're here because we see the impact of chronic underfunding around all of us, all around us every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=60.868s">[Bears]</a>: Kids without the resources they need to thrive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=63.969s">[Bears]</a>: Schools in desperate need of maintenance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=66.429s">[Bears]</a>: Teachers and paras who aren't paid enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=69.11s">[Bears]</a>: Not enough teachers and paras and staff in the first place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=73.57s">[Bears]</a>: Streets and sidewalks in such bad shape that people are getting hurt and everyone's cars constantly need repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=80.352s">[Bears]</a>: A 60-year-old fire headquarters without the proper living quarters and gear storage to keep our firefighters safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=87.901s">[Bears]</a>: Not only do we see it, the numbers lay it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=91.162s">[Bears]</a>: We're the fifth lowest in per capita spending of the 97 cities and towns with more than 20,000 people in Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=99.285s">[Bears]</a>: 92nd out of 97.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=101.646s">[Bears]</a>: Fourth lowest residential property tax rate of that same group, 93rd out of 97.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=106.848s">[Bears]</a>: And we're one of only 20 cities out of all 351 cities and towns in Massachusetts that has never even tried to put an override or a debt exclusion on the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=117.092s">[Bears]</a>: Even the people who passed Proposition 2.5 in 1980 thought that these votes would be happening regularly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=123.498s">[Bears]</a>: It wasn't that we should starve government, it was just that people should know what their money's going towards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=128.904s">[Bears]</a>: And we have those items on the ballot today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=132.687s">[Bears]</a>: We're here because it's time to turn the ship around and invest in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=137.185s">[Bears]</a>: Medford residents have been clamoring for the chance to vote to invest in our city, and elected officials have finally delivered by putting questions six, seven, and eight on the ballot on Tuesday, November 5th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=149.51s">[Bears]</a>: We need to spend the next two months pounding the pavement, raising money, and talking to our neighbors about why we need to vote yes to invest in our schools, our streets, and our fire department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=160.214s">[Bears]</a>: Now, this campaign is not going to be easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=162.815s">[Bears]</a>: Some people may have seen the latest attack line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=165.697s">[Bears]</a>: Stop the scam.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=168.066s">[Bears]</a>: Well, let me tell you now, I think calling the hard work of people coming together to invest in our community a scam is just plain weird.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=177.708s">[Bears]</a>: Our kids are not a scam.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=180.009s">[Bears]</a>: Our teachers and our firefighters are not a scam.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=183.089s">[Bears]</a>: Walking or rolling or driving down the street safely is not a scam.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=187.17s">[Bears]</a>: Doing the right thing for our city is not a scam.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=189.891s">[Bears]</a>: So we're going to push back and we're going to push back hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=192.311s">[Bears]</a>: We'll be correcting the record and busting these myths every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=197.116s">[Bears]</a>: And we'll have resources to help you do it at investinmedford.com.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=200.397s">[Bears]</a>: There's stuff up there now, go check it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=202.338s">[Bears]</a>: There's gonna be even more rolling out over the next few weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=205.739s">[Bears]</a>: I need each and every one of you to be ambassadors for the truth here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=210.4s">[Bears]</a>: So sign up, most everyone did at the front, get trained on the facts and make sure you can step in and correct the record when the lies start coming out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=219.543s">[Bears]</a>: But pushing back just isn't enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=221.224s">[Bears]</a>: We need to fight back in order to win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=223.43s">[Bears]</a>: That means we need to get the facts out to as many people as possible, especially with so many people voting by sending mailers and spending enough money to do this campaign right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=232.097s">[Bears]</a>: Our fundraiser goal was $50,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=235.38s">[Bears]</a>: I want to thank everyone who's already given and raised over $6,000 just in the first two weeks of this campaign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=241.105s">[Bears]</a>: I especially want to thank Dave McKenna and Nicole Morell, who gave $1,000 each.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=245.288s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=248.175s">[Bears]</a>: I wrote a check tonight for $1,000 from my campaign funds because winning this campaign and investing in our future is way more important than me getting reelected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=256.719s">[Bears]</a>: So I want to thank everyone who's already donated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=259.22s">[Bears]</a>: Please donate if you haven't and get the word out to your neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=262.662s">[Bears]</a>: I'm hoping we can raise another $6,000 tonight on our path to victory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=268.485s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you so much for letting me share my thoughts with you tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=271.786s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just so excited to talk to everybody, talk to our neighbors, and especially celebrate with some homegrown entertainment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=279.169s">[Bears]</a>: I love this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=279.989s">[Bears]</a>: We have a truly transformative opportunity to build a better future for Medford and I'm glad to be here with you over the next two months to make it happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=287.555s">[Bears]</a>: Last week I was reminded of some great words from a great campaign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=292.519s">[Bears]</a>: I'm fired up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=293.439s">[Bears]</a>: Are you fired up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=295.661s">[Bears]</a>: I'm ready to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=296.782s">[Bears]</a>: Are you ready to go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=297.662s">[Bears]</a>: Fired up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=300.765s">[Bears]</a>: Ready to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=302.526s">[Bears]</a>: Fired up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=304.287s">[Bears]</a>: Ready to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=305.928s">[Bears]</a>: Let's win this thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=309.292s">[Bears]</a>: Alright, now we need to take that photo so folks could gather here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=22.537s">[Bears]</a>: Welcome, welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=23.539s">[Bears]</a>: We had over 60 people signed up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=25.643s">[Bears]</a>: There's about 30 of us here now, so really appreciate all the turnout.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=51.314s">[Bears]</a>: All right, it's 6.35.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=52.675s">[Bears]</a>: We want to be respectful of people's time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=55.837s">[Bears]</a>: Welcome to our Invest in Medford Zoom Community Forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=60.039s">[Bears]</a>: We will be here tonight until about eight o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=64.742s">[Bears]</a>: And I will be here with School Committee Vice Chair Jenny Graham and School Committee Secretary Paul Rousseau to talk about the Invest in Medford campaign and questions six, seven, and eight on the ballot here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=81.246s">[Bears]</a>: to invest in our schools, our streets, and a new fire headquarters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=85.968s">[Bears]</a>: The format we're gonna be using today is we are going to be starting off with about 10 to 15 minutes of introduction, short presentation from myself and Jenny and Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=98.053s">[Bears]</a>: Then we'll be taking questions for about an hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=102.595s">[Bears]</a>: There is an app up called Slido.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=104.896s">[Bears]</a>: If folks have a difficulty accessing it, let me know, but it should allow you to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=109.736s">[Bears]</a>: ask a question right in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=111.897s">[Bears]</a>: You should also be able to upvote questions that you like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=114.958s">[Bears]</a>: I obviously ask that folks, you know, use the tool responsibly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=120.401s">[Bears]</a>: You know, we had open registration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=121.741s">[Bears]</a>: This is a public meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=123.582s">[Bears]</a>: Looks like most everyone here is using their name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=126.404s">[Bears]</a>: But, you know, just want to do that digital security ask of everyone here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=131.706s">[Bears]</a>: And after that, we'll take about 10 to 15 minutes to wrap up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=135.688s">[Bears]</a>: If you feel<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=136.84s">[Bears]</a>: like a question didn't get asked, or if you wanna follow up with us after, you can send us an email at investinmedford.gmail.com and we will do our best to answer further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=150.29s">[Bears]</a>: And I'm sure all of, many of us are around to talk and answer questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=155.533s">[Bears]</a>: So with that, I will turn things over to Jenny to introduce herself and then Paul, and then we'll go from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=279.495s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Paul and Jenny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=282.645s">[Bears]</a>: So just, we've had a few more people come in, and as I noted before, we're gonna be taking questions right after our presentations and our introductions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=293.731s">[Bears]</a>: There's an app called Slido.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=295.592s">[Bears]</a>: I think I just sent an invitation to everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=298.174s">[Bears]</a>: You can ask questions using this app and upvote questions, and we will take them as they go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=305.798s">[Bears]</a>: If we see the same question multiple times, we're probably only gonna answer it once, but really encourage folks to start<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=312.708s">[Bears]</a>: putting forward their questions using the tool so that we can start to answer them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=319.652s">[Bears]</a>: So feel free to start doing that now, and hopefully we'll have a good lineup of questions to be answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=327.976s">[Bears]</a>: But before that, I just wanna talk a little bit more about how we got here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=332.758s">[Bears]</a>: So as Jenny noted, many of us in the city and many of us who run for office<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=342.486s">[Bears]</a>: have seen the impact of underfunding and austerity budgets and cost growing up faster than revenues going up and the impact that's had on our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=352.335s">[Bears]</a>: We see that our streets are not in the condition we want them to be in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=355.738s">[Bears]</a>: We know we have firefighters at the headquarters that is still appetited and far past the end of its useful life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=361.723s">[Bears]</a>: And of course, as Jenny and Paul have noted, we have a school system that really has faced a lot of challenges when it comes to budgets, hiring staff,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=370.29s">[Bears]</a>: maintaining programs, maintaining buildings, things that we see every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=376.371s">[Bears]</a>: And two years ago in 2022, we had the fiscal 23 budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=384.592s">[Bears]</a>: I'm sure if folks were paying attention at the time, they noted that it was a very contentious budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=392.194s">[Bears]</a>: And one of the things that came out of that was really a clear picture for the first time in a long time of the structural deficit in the city budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=399.91s">[Bears]</a>: the use of one-time funds to pay for ongoing expenses, the soon-to-be-expiring federal funds that even two years ago were on our radar as expiring that we were using to pay to keep our schools and our city moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=414.818s">[Bears]</a>: And where we are after that budget season, the city council, Councilor Collins and I tried to work with the mayor to see if we could get towards looking at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=428.191s">[Bears]</a>: an override to address that structural deficit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=430.933s">[Bears]</a>: We weren't able to reach an agreement, but the following budget season, after a lot of negotiation, we were able to work with the mayor to form, to reach an agreement, to pass a budget ordinance and to form a financial task force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=446.366s">[Bears]</a>: The school committee through its budget process and the council through this budget ordinance have really moved to a more transparent process that's more engaging of the public when we talk about creating the budget and understanding the challenges that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=458.935s">[Bears]</a>: And the piece I want to focus on just for a minute is the financial task force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=463.357s">[Bears]</a>: So the task force was announced in June of 2023, and consisting of the mayor, who is also the chair of the school committee, the council president, the council vice president, the school committee vice chair, and the chief of staff, also being supported by the staff in both our city departments<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=485.149s">[Bears]</a>: finance, et cetera, assessing, and our school finance and operations team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=490.834s">[Bears]</a>: So that task force was announced in June 2023.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=493.936s">[Bears]</a>: We started to meet, we put out an initial press release and public statement in September of 2023, talking about how we were going to continue to meet with the goal of coming back to folks before the end of the fiscal year with a proposal that addressed the major financial challenges facing the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=514.062s">[Bears]</a>: In March of 2023, sorry, 2024, we kind of put out, we announced a framework for that approach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=523.207s">[Bears]</a>: And then in June, we released the detail of that plan, which are the three ballot questions that are now on the ballot for November 5th for the consideration of the voters of the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=535.473s">[Bears]</a>: Those ballot questions are question six, what should be a debt exclusion to fund the construction of a new fire headquarters?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=542.596s">[Bears]</a>: Question seven,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=544.457s">[Bears]</a>: which addresses the school system structural deficit and also the fact that right now we don't have anyone in our DPW who is dedicated to fixing our streets and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=556.866s">[Bears]</a>: We would bring back a dedicated street and sidewalk repair crew for the first time in many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=561.749s">[Bears]</a>: And question eight is about the future of our schools and then really investing and expanding our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=566.152s">[Bears]</a>: So the $4 million override to invest<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=571.906s">[Bears]</a>: significantly into our schools, into our educators, into programming, into making our schools what we want to be, and addressing what Jenny and Paul noted, all of the things that people want to see our schools do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=584.271s">[Bears]</a>: Now, will we be able to do every single one of them with $4 million?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=587.072s">[Bears]</a>: No, but it's the first time we're going to be able to have a serious conversation about what transformational investment would look like in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=595.056s">[Bears]</a>: So the total of those items, the debt exclusion pays for a $30 million bond,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=601.394s">[Bears]</a>: The estimated cost of that is about $2 million per year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=604.915s">[Bears]</a>: That's question six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=606.155s">[Bears]</a>: Question seven is $3.5 million per year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=610.257s">[Bears]</a>: And question eight is $4 million per year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=613.538s">[Bears]</a>: Those amounts would be part of the property tax levy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=617.499s">[Bears]</a>: They would be paid by residents and businesses, and it would essentially affect the tax rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=623.981s">[Bears]</a>: The tax rate would be about 60 cents per, 60 cents higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=629.042s">[Bears]</a>: So it would go up from about 8.5<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=631.929s">[Bears]</a>: dollars per $1,000 in assessed value to about $9.1 per $1,000 in assessed value.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=639.212s">[Bears]</a>: And the average impact on the average single family home is about $37 per month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=644.635s">[Bears]</a>: So that is the summary of what we're talking about and how we got here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=650.697s">[Bears]</a>: And, you know, the financial task force really does believe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=655.276s">[Bears]</a>: that and has stated very clearly that this is a path forward that really does bring us to some financial stability and also the ability to make significant investments in our public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=667.98s">[Bears]</a>: So with that, I will end my comments and we can move into the question and answer period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=675.963s">[Bears]</a>: I see we do have a few questions here and I really do hope folks will submit some questions in the Q and A so that we can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=684.6s">[Bears]</a>: answer any concerns and provide information to the community about the questions they see around the override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=698.484s">[Bears]</a>: And I'm just putting out an invite once again for folks to submit their questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=703.225s">[Bears]</a>: The first question is, can you speak to cuts that will likely be made in our schools should the overrides not pass?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=708.747s">[Bears]</a>: That's from Melanie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=710.343s">[Bears]</a>: H and we have five likes on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=713.207s">[Bears]</a>: I will go to Paul or Jenny to talk about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1389.767s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I think just to follow up on that, the specifics of the cuts are part of the budget process, but the answer is 35 to 45 full-time equivalent positions, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1399.71s">[Bears]</a>: And that's...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1433.66s">[Bears]</a>: then I will clarify to at least 35 to 45 full-time equivalent positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1437.781s">[Bears]</a>: But what that looks like, I mean, that's, it's a huge cut, you know, that's, it's incredibly large.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1446.364s">[Bears]</a>: It's certainly would affect every building, every classroom, every program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1453.146s">[Bears]</a>: Jenny and Paul, I just wanted to follow up on, I just wanted to follow up on one thing, Jenny, first before we go to, there are some,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1461.84s">[Bears]</a>: Good questions here that we want to get to, but what was just there was 1 follow up to this question, which was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1467.342s">[Bears]</a>: What was actually cut this year and would anything be able to come back if the override did pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1650.342s">[Bears]</a>: I think that's a great transition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1651.763s">[Bears]</a>: And I think we might be able to meet both of your requests, Jenny, for a more hopeful question and talk about some of the things we could be able to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1660.411s">[Bears]</a>: The question was, could you provide some examples about funds from question eight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1664.974s">[Bears]</a>: So that is the investing more in our schools question, what those could be used to improve our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2169.997s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2170.957s">[Bears]</a>: I want to move to some of our other top questions here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2174.299s">[Bears]</a>: And folks, please feel free to submit some more questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2177.26s">[Bears]</a>: We have about 35, 40 minutes before we start to move into some wrapping up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2181.742s">[Bears]</a>: But the two top questions on deck right now, we'll start with one along these lines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2190.566s">[Bears]</a>: Is there a long-term plan to fill these budget gaps, or will we continue to need budget overrides?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2197.213s">[Bears]</a>: The answer is there is a long-term plan to increase revenue for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2201.874s">[Bears]</a>: The city council has been working on that in partnership with our planning department for several years now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2208.476s">[Bears]</a>: Two years ago, we passed the first recodification of the city zoning in 60 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2215.398s">[Bears]</a>: And what that does is if we allow new development and new growth, that is the only way outside of an override or a debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2223.7s">[Bears]</a>: that the property tax levy can increase above the 2.5%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2228.742s">[Bears]</a>: So the last two years have actually been the best two years for new growth values in the city of Medford in the last 25 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2236.804s">[Bears]</a>: No matter what other people may say about that, that's just the fact you can go to the State Department of Revenue Division of Local Services website to see that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2245.847s">[Bears]</a>: And that has helped in the past two years, it hasn't been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2251.807s">[Bears]</a>: astronomical Cambridge, Somerville, Boston level, or even Worcester level growth, but it has been an improvement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2260.288s">[Bears]</a>: It has staved off even more cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2263.649s">[Bears]</a>: It made possible this year some of what Jenny and Paul were talking about around not having to make the cuts that we had to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2272.751s">[Bears]</a>: And part of that is also the one-time revenue, the one-time funding from the federal government, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2279.432s">[Bears]</a>: But the city council,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2281.661s">[Bears]</a>: In partnership with the planning department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2283.742s">[Bears]</a>: We now have a city comprehensive plan for the first time ever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2287.684s">[Bears]</a>: We have a city housing production plan we also have our climate plan and our open space plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2293.627s">[Bears]</a>: And those are going, all of those are being looped into a zoning update project that the council has been working on with the planning department and our zoning consultant in associates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2307.559s">[Bears]</a>: 11 times on that year in city council in our planning and permitting committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2312.743s">[Bears]</a>: We have some really, we made some initial adjustments and we have some really, I think, transformative proposals coming up around our Mystic Avenue corridor, our Salem Street corridor, our Medford Square corridor, in terms of the transforming those neighborhoods and allowing significant new growth to see<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2335.123s">[Bears]</a>: modern walkable mixed use corridors with commercial space and residential space that once the zoning is completed and then once property owners and developers come in to start working on these projects would be transformative for our community in terms of raising revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2354.67s">[Bears]</a>: So that is the long-term vision for how we raise revenue beyond going down the other model.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2362.164s">[Bears]</a>: I think this is maybe going into the next question a little bit, but the other model is the Winchester, Weston, Arlington, and other place model, which if folks don't know, those are places that do overrides and debt exclusions all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2378.53s">[Bears]</a>: Something that may be a surprise to folks is that when Proposition 2 1⁄2 passed in 1980, the proponents of Proposition 2 1⁄2 actually said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2390.583s">[Bears]</a>: that they expected communities to do overrides and debt exclusions regularly, and that the reason for the law was just so that it would be transparent and decided on by the voters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2402.488s">[Bears]</a>: Now, many, 315, I think, of the 351 cities and towns in Massachusetts have since proposed an overrider or debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2412.612s">[Bears]</a>: Many of those communities have passed an overrider or debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2415.773s">[Bears]</a>: Medford is one of the few that has never even put one on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2420.501s">[Bears]</a>: So we think that with our location close to Boston, the value of our community, the transformative opportunities and corridors that have not seen the economic development focus that they've needed to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2433.652s">[Bears]</a>: And quite frankly, if we had seen 10, 20, 30 years ago, we might be having a different conversation today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2439.156s">[Bears]</a>: We might be having a conversation more like a Somerville or a Cambridge or even an Everett.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2444.501s">[Bears]</a>: That's a way for us to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2447.011s">[Bears]</a>: transform the community in a positive way, bring new amenities and benefits to the people who live here and increase the city's tax base significantly in the long run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2456.698s">[Bears]</a>: I think in the medium to short term, you know, the financial task force believes that these overrides and the debt exclusion for the fire station provide significant fiscal space in the next few years for the city to not be in a budget crunch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2473.03s">[Bears]</a>: and maybe even be a bridge entirely to that development and revenue from those new developments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2479.452s">[Bears]</a>: I can't say that with any certainty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2481.232s">[Bears]</a>: Certainly if there's another period, you know, if the tariff that have been proposed by a presidential candidate go into place and we see inflation at 10 or 20% again in the next couple of years, we're gonna be in really big trouble right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2494.876s">[Bears]</a>: If we see 2% inflation for the next 10 years, it's a different story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2499.397s">[Bears]</a>: But, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2502.645s">[Bears]</a>: That's really the thinking here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2504.506s">[Bears]</a>: The one project that I think would fall outside of that is, of course, the new Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2508.91s">[Bears]</a>: There is no way, and you haven't really seen any community, even Somerville with Assembly Row had to do a debt exclusion for its new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2517.276s">[Bears]</a>: That is the one project that I think there would be a further request of the voters to fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2522.901s">[Bears]</a>: But right now, that is the only thing on the horizon that the current leadership team between the mayor, council, and school committee foresees asking the voters to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2532.557s">[Bears]</a>: the conditions remain reasonable and we don't have 20% tariffs on everything we import.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2542.462s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know if Jenny or Paul you want to add on that long term court plan around the budget gaps at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2658.793s">[Bears]</a>: I think there's a follow-up on that, Jenny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2660.973s">[Bears]</a>: There's a question, why do we have to wait so long for the high school debt exclusion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2664.234s">[Bears]</a>: And I may have misspoke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2665.334s">[Bears]</a>: That would be sooner than 5 to 10 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2667.595s">[Bears]</a>: The MSBA process, the stage we're in now, we would probably find out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2671.336s">[Bears]</a>: Jenny, could you go into that a little bit more?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2752.161s">[Bears]</a>: For the new high school for the new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2753.922s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2754.863s">[Bears]</a>: All right, Paul, I cut you off and then I will go to Matt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2764.988s">[Bears]</a>: Another panel, Matt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2896.746s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just missing those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2897.686s">[Bears]</a>: That's really a really important point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2899.707s">[Bears]</a>: Sometimes I take for granted that people don't know that we don't have such basic things that I forget to mention that we're establishing things for the first time here in Medford that many communities have had for decades, if not longer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2914.238s">[Bears]</a>: Jack, could I speak to the admin is heavy question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2919.101s">[Bears]</a>: Sure, yeah, we'll jump back to that and then we can talk about a couple other questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3196.668s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3197.268s">[Bears]</a>: I want to go to the next question that we have a bunch of votes on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3201.829s">[Bears]</a>: which is, do we know what other towns have done to get overrides to pass given that Medford is a laggard compared to similar towns?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3209.574s">[Bears]</a>: I will defer to my colleagues in just a moment, but I wish there was a magic formula, because I'd be less stressed out about whether or not this question or these questions are going to pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3223.463s">[Bears]</a>: I think, to be honest, the first step is the city government needs to have the courage to ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3229.394s">[Bears]</a>: This is the first time the city government has had the courage to ask the voters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3233.876s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think anyone thinks, oh, let's raise our taxes is a popular thing for anyone to ask anyone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3241.64s">[Bears]</a>: And I understand like deeply and completely that it's a difficult decision for a lot of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3246.162s">[Bears]</a>: I think we all understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3248.583s">[Bears]</a>: I think we also know that there's a lot of difficult decisions that have been had to be made or continue to be making when it comes to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3257.961s">[Bears]</a>: layoffs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3258.682s">[Bears]</a>: And do we pay our staff enough?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3261.023s">[Bears]</a>: And do we have this department exist anymore?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3265.326s">[Bears]</a>: Things that are really fundamental to the functioning of city government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3269.049s">[Bears]</a>: And, you know, do we have our firefighters have a building where they feel like they're not going to get sick in that building, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3275.434s">[Bears]</a>: Like, these are really human deep questions, just as much as am I able to afford the tax increase is a really human deep question for a lot of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3283.98s">[Bears]</a>: And I think for a long time, city government<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3288.004s">[Bears]</a>: felt like we could keep asking the community to not invest in city government, to do more with less, and found creative or uncreative or short-term, not long-term ways to make that work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3304.816s">[Bears]</a>: And the last five years, especially with the pandemic and with the cost growth, we hit the wall, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3311.101s">[Bears]</a>: And so now we don't have another choice but to ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3314.443s">[Bears]</a>: And I think we've been clear that if we ask and we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3317.472s">[Bears]</a>: And the answer is no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3318.372s">[Bears]</a>: And there's a lot of very, very hard choices that come after that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3323.555s">[Bears]</a>: And so that's the first step I think to getting an override to pass is that an override is on the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3330.979s">[Bears]</a>: From what other towns have done what we need to do I think Matt really spoke to it and Paul spoke to it and Jenny spoke to it as well right like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3339.255s">[Bears]</a>: How do one of the big things that we're talking about the financial task force is how do we make sure that we address the scope of problems that is significant enough that people can see the investment that we're asking them to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3349.543s">[Bears]</a>: Because if we don't do a big enough thing and we ask people to do this and they don't actually see a change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3356.209s">[Bears]</a>: we're not engendering any more trust than we've been engendering with the lack of progress that the city has been making for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3363.4s">[Bears]</a>: Um, so I'm really encouraged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3365.64s">[Bears]</a>: I think we've done a lot of public education, quite frankly, over the last two to four years around the difficulties and issues that we see in our schools and on our streets and in our city departments, where a lot of people are saying, Hey, you know, maybe I don't want to pay more taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3383.283s">[Bears]</a>: Maybe it will be a challenge for me to figure out how to afford to pay more taxes, but also I care about this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3390.205s">[Bears]</a>: And I know that we need to do these things because.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3393.394s">[Bears]</a>: And we can just see it, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3395.576s">[Bears]</a>: Like it's literally the environment that we live in and the buildings that our kids are in and the teachers who are overworked and the city employees who are overworked, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3406.405s">[Bears]</a>: Like we see and feel the reality and I think people are ready to make this investment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3411.288s">[Bears]</a>: So I've been really encouraged talking to my neighbors, been really encouraged talking to lots of folks across the city that these things are going to pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3421.348s">[Bears]</a>: And I think the good thing that if we move forward on these is it sets a foundation for us to show progress, to show improvement, to maybe get the financial systems and softwares in place where we can point to a dashboard instead of a spreadsheet, point to, you know, pull data in a day instead of a week to answer questions more quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3445.364s">[Bears]</a>: And my hope is to see that virtuous cycle of investment beginning more investment and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3450.799s">[Bears]</a>: city government having the resources that it needs to do its job, meaning that the public trust the city can do its job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3457.743s">[Bears]</a>: So that is my real hope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3461.344s">[Bears]</a>: I feel good right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3463.285s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to be working very hard over the next 27 days, talking to people, getting people, raising money to send out the mailers, doing all the different things that we need to do to make sure that we get a yes vote on November 5th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3477.653s">[Bears]</a>: But that's my kind of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3480.609s">[Bears]</a>: pitch and spiel around what do we need to do to get an override to pass and why we went this direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3487.034s">[Bears]</a>: Paul, I see that you're next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3734.926s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know if anyone can tell that Paul is the secretary of the school committee, because one of the jobs that Paul has to do is sign every bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3741.79s">[Bears]</a>: So he's pretty familiar with that side of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3746.133s">[Bears]</a>: I think Jenny raised the same exact point, though, around our class sizes, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3754.298s">[Bears]</a>: When you ask teachers and paras to have more kids in the room, it gets harder to educate the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3763.203s">[Bears]</a>: And if you can have four less kids in a room, that may be the difference between someone staying or someone going somewhere else where the class sizes are smaller.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3773.309s">[Bears]</a>: To be honest, there's burnout and turnover in the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3776.29s">[Bears]</a>: Sure, I'm on the city council and I spend a lot more time on the city side of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3781.544s">[Bears]</a>: We have a lot of turnover and burnout on the city side too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3784.065s">[Bears]</a>: A lot of great folks come in, build some relationships.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3788.247s">[Bears]</a>: They're here for a year, they're here for two years, and then they get offered a job that isn't as many hours, is at a higher pay rate in another city or in the private sector, and they move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3798.872s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, I think the greatest example of this is our issue hiring a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3805.554s">[Bears]</a>: We've raised the pay like two or three times now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3809.454s">[Bears]</a>: hoping that this latest one, which was just a month ago, might actually, or two months ago, might actually lock us in and hopefully we can hire someone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3817.539s">[Bears]</a>: But yeah, people come in, they work hard, they realize that they don't have the, they're working more or doing more jobs that they would have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3827.566s">[Bears]</a>: And then, you know, doing two jobs here where they might be able to do one job in another community, they move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3833.09s">[Bears]</a>: And I think we see that across the board, city and schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3835.511s">[Bears]</a>: I wanna go to the next question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3839.824s">[Bears]</a>: We'll just want to add in quickly that there was a clarification on the heavy administrator talking about the curriculum and department heads, not more superintendents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3847.83s">[Bears]</a>: So just wanted to note that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3849.591s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks for putting that clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3853.935s">[Bears]</a>: On the questions here that are left and we're coming up, you know, we got to probably about 10 or so minutes left if folks want to throw another question into the chat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3864.431s">[Bears]</a>: The next one is, has there been discussions about an owner-occupied property tax exemption like Cambridge and Somerville have, and is that something the city council could pass?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3873.375s">[Bears]</a>: So every year we use, we set the tax rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3879.117s">[Bears]</a>: I won't go into the, take me more than 10 minutes to go into the complexities of exactly how Proposition 2 1⁄2 works, but we set the tax rate every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3887.561s">[Bears]</a>: And one of the options that is, you know, we technically vote to consider is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3893.052s">[Bears]</a>: could we do an owner-occupied property tax exemption?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3896.534s">[Bears]</a>: What that means is that the city would set a certain percentage of the average residential bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3905.058s">[Bears]</a>: And if you were an owner-occupied unit, you would get that, essentially, your tax bill would go down by that amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3913.301s">[Bears]</a>: Let's use some round numbers here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3914.702s">[Bears]</a>: Let's say it's $3,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3917.406s">[Bears]</a>: that would be like a 30% exemption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3919.928s">[Bears]</a>: Let's say it's $3,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3920.868s">[Bears]</a>: Now, I don't know off the top of my head, it's actually probably pretty close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3925.871s">[Bears]</a>: How that would work is everybody who pays a residential tax bill from, if your owner occupied, regardless of your value, you'd get $3,000 off your bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3940.5s">[Bears]</a>: So if your house, essentially it creates a breakeven point where,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3947.199s">[Bears]</a>: And it's a little more complicated than this, but basically everyone who's owner-occupied would get that cut off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3953.541s">[Bears]</a>: But that money doesn't just go away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3955.161s">[Bears]</a>: The city can't afford to actually have the taxes go down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3958.022s">[Bears]</a>: So that amount that owner-occupants get, that reduction, gets shifted onto people who don't get the owner-occupant exemption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3964.984s">[Bears]</a>: So essentially, you'd be shifting the city, the cost of the property tax on residential properties,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3972.589s">[Bears]</a>: off of owner-occupants onto non-owner-occupants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3975.83s">[Bears]</a>: But the other side of that is that that actually changes the tax rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3979.351s">[Bears]</a>: It essentially means instead of a flat residential tax rate on residential tax bills, you end up with a progressive rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3987.815s">[Bears]</a>: I don't actually think that's a bad thing, but one of the reasons that previous councils prior to 2022<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3997.83s">[Bears]</a>: didn't pass it is it actually would raise taxes on owner occupants in high value homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4003.775s">[Bears]</a>: So if your home is worth more than the breakeven point, even though you get the exemption, the tax rates going up more than the exemptions, you actually pay more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4012.583s">[Bears]</a>: The point being that it's a complicated conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4016.206s">[Bears]</a>: Essentially, if you are in a condo or a small single family and you're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4021.954s">[Bears]</a>: living in that, you're an owner occupant, your taxes will probably go down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4025.435s">[Bears]</a>: If you're in an expensive single family or a multifamily, your taxes are probably going up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4030.657s">[Bears]</a>: If you're a certainly large apartment buildings, those there'd be significant increase because the rate would go up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4036.599s">[Bears]</a>: So it's not just this, you know, everyone who gets an if we implemented it tomorrow, that everyone would get this benefit in the same way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4043.441s">[Bears]</a>: It's a complicated conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4046.164s">[Bears]</a>: One of the reasons we haven't implemented it is because both the previous city assessor and the current city assessor say it would take them about a year to do the calculations and get everything in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4056.556s">[Bears]</a>: And they'd probably need one to two more staff people in the assessing office just to process the applications for the owner occupancy exemption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4065.606s">[Bears]</a>: So it's a significant undertaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4068.5s">[Bears]</a>: A lot of places like Everett's and Somerville's and Cambridge's did this a long time ago when the conversation was a little bit different because of the property values that we see today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4080.931s">[Bears]</a>: But yeah, so we've talked about it a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4082.312s">[Bears]</a>: I think I actually know too much about it because I don't know that I explained it particularly well right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4087.417s">[Bears]</a>: But we've talked about it every year that we've set the tax rate since I've been on the council and I know on prior councils before that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4094.125s">[Bears]</a>: It would be a complicated undertaking, and it isn't the silver bullet that it's presented to be a lot of the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4101.047s">[Bears]</a>: But do I think it's a bad idea?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4102.627s">[Bears]</a>: No, and I'd be willing to move forward on it if folks felt we could make the time and effort and make it a priority personally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4112.87s">[Bears]</a>: Next question is on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4116.838s">[Bears]</a>: The when would we expect to see changes to the high school vocational schedule, if we were able to move forward and if the negotiations were able to be concluded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4353.626s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4354.827s">[Bears]</a>: And I think, yeah, I think everybody who's everyone I've talked to talks about it gets that it's a heavy lift, but also that getting prepared to make that lift everyone's on that page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4365.17s">[Bears]</a>: All right, we got two more questions left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4367.19s">[Bears]</a>: We're about on time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4369.875s">[Bears]</a>: Well, two and a half, there's a dueling questions for anyone who's seen it at the end and we'll take that one last, but just Rebecca's question is money from the override only required to go to the directed budget for the first year and after that could go anywhere else in the city budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4384.946s">[Bears]</a>: There's two answers to this question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4388.649s">[Bears]</a>: Proposition two and a half date law requires that in the first year, it goes towards the specific purposes outlined in the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4396.735s">[Bears]</a>: Those appropriations would be made<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4399.329s">[Bears]</a>: people would be hired, things would be purchased, contracts would be signed based on those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4407.856s">[Bears]</a>: In the second year, could the mayor and the school committee and the council then fire everybody that they just hired and go completely in another direction?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4416.482s">[Bears]</a>: And I mean, is it legally allowed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4421.866s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, is it something that would be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4424.577s">[Bears]</a>: in the realm of possibility?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4426.098s">[Bears]</a>: Absolutely not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4427.358s">[Bears]</a>: I think we've all been very, very clear that what the purpose of these overrides are for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4432.58s">[Bears]</a>: And I don't think anyone here, I think we've already been very clear that we don't like the fact that there are layoffs and position cuts and things happening now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4442.164s">[Bears]</a>: I certainly don't think that some massive bait and switch, I don't even know what we would put it into, to be honest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4450.227s">[Bears]</a>: These are the things that we want to do with the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4452.288s">[Bears]</a>: These are the things that we think are the priority of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4455.37s">[Bears]</a>: And yeah, there's a little bit of trust that comes from that, and I acknowledge that, but we've been very clear about what these priorities are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4466.259s">[Bears]</a>: And a lot of it, especially on the school side, is also subject to negotiation, collective bargaining agreements, other laws, and that's what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4478.93s">[Bears]</a>: We've been very clear that if these overrides are to pass,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4482.68s">[Bears]</a>: they would fund our schools, they would fund our educators, they would fund the people who work in our schools, they would hire a DPW street crew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4490.705s">[Bears]</a>: And what I can say is that if the debt exclusion passes question six, that just have to go to the fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4495.908s">[Bears]</a>: That's the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4497.088s">[Bears]</a>: They can only pay for the bond for the fire station, period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4500.73s">[Bears]</a>: So that's the answer to that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4504.132s">[Bears]</a>: And can I just add to that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4658.241s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks, Jenny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4660.083s">[Bears]</a>: I want to move to wrap up on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4664.764s">[Bears]</a>: The last couple of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4666.444s">[Bears]</a>: So we have dueling questions that I think probably none of us here on the panel are the people who should be answering these questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4671.746s">[Bears]</a>: So I would ask us not to answer them, but I will read them since they have been asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4675.747s">[Bears]</a>: They are, how could the CC and SC accept a pay raise when you say we're in dire need of money and then ask for an override?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4684.089s">[Bears]</a>: And that has been also countered with the question, how can we increase CC and SC pay to increase diversity on those bodies so they represent the city's diverse population?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4693.012s">[Bears]</a>: Those are both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4695.701s">[Bears]</a>: viewpoints that people hold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4698.783s">[Bears]</a>: We have a final question here, which is what is the impact of union student leadership, either having had posed or unsure yet on the overhead set exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4709.788s">[Bears]</a>: So that's that the fire union is not supportive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4712.87s">[Bears]</a>: And the teachers union has not yet made a decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4717.252s">[Bears]</a>: I don't I don't know what the impact of it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4721.114s">[Bears]</a>: Certainly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4722.409s">[Bears]</a>: I would hope that in the case of the fire union, that they could put aside some of their differences with the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4729.995s">[Bears]</a>: And I think the funding of this project and that we are prioritizing funding a new fire station should be considered independently of the disputes that the mayor and the fire union have had over fire station design and other matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4745.547s">[Bears]</a>: That's my personal opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4748.263s">[Bears]</a>: And I know I've spoken to a lot of our educators about these questions and some support, some oppose, and I'll leave it up to the Medford Teachers Association and other educator unions here in the city to make the decision that they need to make in the time that they need to make it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4766.757s">[Bears]</a>: With that, I wanted to wrap up quickly unless, Paul, Jenny, you have anything else you wanna add before I just put out a few pitches to the folks who are still here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4826.24s">[Bears]</a>: There are also, thanks, Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4828.582s">[Bears]</a>: To that point, there's also two more opportunities coming up for folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4832.284s">[Bears]</a>: If you thought of a question as we're wrapping up, or you think of one after you leave here tonight,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4837.55s">[Bears]</a>: Next Tuesday at 6pm we have a city council committee of the whole meeting in the city council chamber, where we will be talking kind of doing a similar q amp a style format, you'll hear from members of the council and basically answering the questions they feel like they can answer asked by the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4854.461s">[Bears]</a>: Then we also have an in-person version of this event, an Invest in Medford community forum, Monday, October 21st at 7pm, and that's going to be at the library.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4864.226s">[Bears]</a>: So those are two more opportunities that we have for very similar events.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5048.396s">[Bears]</a>: which really gets into some of the details on what would be the impact if the overrides don't pass?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5055.64s">[Bears]</a>: Why do we need the overrides?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5057.461s">[Bears]</a>: What are overrides and debt exclusions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5060.502s">[Bears]</a>: How will they impact your taxes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5063.064s">[Bears]</a>: And then just some of the information about how to measure taxes compared to other cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5069.627s">[Bears]</a>: You know, one thing that I think is just really important to note, our residential tax rate is the 93rd lowest out of the 97<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5077.486s">[Bears]</a>: MA cities and towns with population over 20,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5082.33s">[Bears]</a>: And there's just a lot more here on the website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5102.166s">[Bears]</a>: Mail voting has already started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5104.007s">[Bears]</a>: Early voting starts Saturday, October 19th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5106.983s">[Bears]</a>: And election day, if you're voting at your polling location, if you haven't made your choice by Tuesday, November 5th, polling locations will be open 7 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5115.106s">[Bears]</a>: to 8 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5116.446s">[Bears]</a>: on November 5th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5117.566s">[Bears]</a>: So we really, really hope that everyone here will vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5121.307s">[Bears]</a>: And I think it's fair to say that this panel hopes that folks will vote yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5127.509s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks everybody for a wonderful evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5129.53s">[Bears]</a>: Really appreciate everyone being here and hope to see you over the next few weeks as we lead up to election day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=600.702s">[Bears]</a>: Uh, councilor present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=602.964s">[Bears]</a>: Do we know if the charter study committee's recommendations use these?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=607.909s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=608.31s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=608.57s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=776.874s">[Bears]</a>: when everyone else is ready to go to the next slide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=809.685s">[Bears]</a>: I'm good, I have some thoughts, but I can defer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=913.625s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I think just to get a little bit more explicit on that, we'll see what their proposals and ideas are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=920.67s">[Bears]</a>: I would think, it seems to me that there's three and maybe a fourth logical division of this for us, given that I think we're gonna make some changes to the ideas and proposals of the Charter Study Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=934.767s">[Bears]</a>: So I could kind of see it going and there could be an added step potentially, but my thinking is that the, and I don't even know if we need its own meeting for this necessarily, but the legislative and executive branch question would be one piece of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=955.6s">[Bears]</a>: The administrative organization, financial procedures organization would be another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=962.124s">[Bears]</a>: And then the citizen participation and elections piece could be the third.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=968.448s">[Bears]</a>: And I think then maybe the incorporation, general provisions, transitional provisions would be another bucket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=981.576s">[Bears]</a>: along with school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=983.218s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just wondering if we want to have our own meeting for school committee and invite the school committee members to input, have their input on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=990.665s">[Bears]</a>: And maybe that could be, maybe it's three meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=992.987s">[Bears]</a>: Maybe it's like legislative executive administration or four meetings, legislative executive administration, financial elections, and citizen participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1001.816s">[Bears]</a>: And maybe we could also do the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1004.713s">[Bears]</a>: incorporate the, you know, incorporation and the general provisions as part of that I think that might be, I'm just trying to think of like the scope of work, you know, those seem to be a little bit quicker to get through like I'm sure we'll just kind of take what the Charter Study Committee said for section one is like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1022.773s">[Bears]</a>: you know, we are the city of Medford and this is our mission statement, that kind of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1026.796s">[Bears]</a>: It's not as nitty gritty as the details of like, what are the districts maybe going to be for different bodies?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1034.202s">[Bears]</a>: Or do we want that to be uniform?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1037.724s">[Bears]</a>: You know, powers, of course, are a huge question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1040.987s">[Bears]</a>: Do we want to go down the road of certain things around elections?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1044.81s">[Bears]</a>: We already have elections every two years, stuff like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1048.273s">[Bears]</a>: So I think those are,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1051.428s">[Bears]</a>: kind of the bigger buckets of work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1054.514s">[Bears]</a>: So maybe there's five buckets of work, but maybe it's four meetings, maybe we could do a couple in one meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1061.894s">[Bears]</a>: And the one that just sticks out to me is what we might want to schedule separately as a school committee, just so that I just don't think we should lump that in with legislative executive branch I think it's a little bit different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1074.023s">[Bears]</a>: And then I think if we're having those four meetings of this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1077.666s">[Bears]</a>: My other question would be, do we want to have a meeting before those four meetings where we.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1084.551s">[Bears]</a>: receive the mayor's thoughts and the study committee's thoughts before we go into specifically those four meetings on the actual topics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1095.002s">[Bears]</a>: And that might give Councilors, you know, time to review that report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1100.168s">[Bears]</a>: If we want to send any questions back to the mayor or to KP or Tina to legal counsel or to the study committee, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1107.867s">[Bears]</a>: we could do that and then we could go step by step and say like, here are the four meetings and Councilors could bring their proposals to those four meetings on the different kind of areas of the charter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1118.413s">[Bears]</a>: And that would probably be maybe that first meeting where we just start reviewing and asking questions about the study committee proposals and recommendations and the mayor's report, you know, recommendations and proposals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1130.68s">[Bears]</a>: Maybe that's next month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1132.081s">[Bears]</a>: And then maybe we could do, try to do one or two meetings a month over the next<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1136.957s">[Bears]</a>: you know, December, January, February, and then hopefully we're getting something out by March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1142.998s">[Bears]</a>: Um, and maybe we could even be putting that on the ballot for November, 2025, um, to go into effect in 2027, something like that would just be my thinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1155.881s">[Bears]</a>: Um, instead of having, I think if we go longer than that, we're probably waiting until 2026 or 2027 and not having anything going to effect for another five years, which I think we all want to avoid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1274.377s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, and to Councilor Collins, Vice President Collins' point, maybe that's the approach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1277.88s">[Bears]</a>: Maybe that meeting in a month from now or so is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1282.426s">[Bears]</a>: if we took down the four or five buckets that I kind of outlined, have Councilors bring their ideas, what they've seen, what they think works for Medford, bring that to the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1294.217s">[Bears]</a>: We could then also have Collins Center or study committee or an example from another community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1299.481s">[Bears]</a>: And that would be a way for us to have that discussion without it being inherently like, I think what we want to avoid here is, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1311.274s">[Bears]</a>: Pitting different groups that have been moving through this against one another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1315.876s">[Bears]</a>: And like the ideas, I think like there's just going to be different ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1318.258s">[Bears]</a>: And now that this process that we are starting our process, which is the formal process and, you know, it can't move forward without a vote of the council can't move forward without the mayor being able to say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1330.68s">[Bears]</a>: All right, councilors think this, council maybe has been able to reach some consensus here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1335.963s">[Bears]</a>: How does that compare to what the mayor's thinking is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1338.324s">[Bears]</a>: How does that compare to what the charter study committee's ideas are?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1341.126s">[Bears]</a>: How does that compare to what some other communities do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1343.547s">[Bears]</a>: That would be a good way for us to factor in those different perspectives in a way that is productive and based on like a discussion format rather than it being like competing proposals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1453.645s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1454.085s">[Bears]</a>: I would move to have the chair through the clerk, send that out to members of the committee for members of the committee to come back with their ideas and comments on each of the different articles and sections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1466.134s">[Bears]</a>: And maybe when you send that out chair, you could lump them into those different groupings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1472.378s">[Bears]</a>: Each of it's basically I think two or three articles, a group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1476.198s">[Bears]</a>: And then when we come back in a month, hopefully we'll have a good discussion on that substance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1481.72s">[Bears]</a>: And then, so I'd move to do that and move to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1484.522s">[Bears]</a>: All one motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1486.963s">[Bears]</a>: Oh, Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1527.013s">[Bears]</a>: What you said will give us a picture of their ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2074.622s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, and just to clarify, that's basically just the New Herb Chambers Old Century Bank, the Volkswagen dealership, and the car wash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2084.064s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2100.205s">[Bears]</a>: I think the, yes, I think the blue dogleg, I think we went a little.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2105.087s">[Bears]</a>: I think on the far end of the Somerville border and the three parcels front that have frontage on Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2113.649s">[Bears]</a>: I think we should make those commercial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2115.79s">[Bears]</a>: If you even look at that far, the last parcel in the city, even on the other side of the fence and the other side of East Albion Street, there's actually another industrial building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2125.205s">[Bears]</a>: on the other side of that, so it's not fronting, those last two lots, the back is not fronting residential property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2131.788s">[Bears]</a>: And then I had a question on that, and I think the one, the little, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2138.14s">[Bears]</a>: That big long one that has that little driveway that you could see out to Mystic Ave, that's that big rear Mystic Ave thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2144.862s">[Bears]</a>: I think that parcel immediately to the northwest is a gas station right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2151.744s">[Bears]</a>: And it has that Mystic Ave frontage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2153.085s">[Bears]</a>: So I just think that should be commercial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2155.926s">[Bears]</a>: And then those two that abut the mass inspection site should be, you know, basically the SunRail border, that inspection site, those should be commercial as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2163.728s">[Bears]</a>: And then I just had a question about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2167.659s">[Bears]</a>: I know we generally like to do the zones based on parcels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2170.7s">[Bears]</a>: That rear mystic app parcel is a real funky parcel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2173.8s">[Bears]</a>: And I'm wondering, could we split that parcel into two different zones, or is that really not recommended?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2191.144s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2192.384s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just thinking, like, maybe just take everything where the commercial line<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2240.952s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, that would be my recommendation there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2243.454s">[Bears]</a>: I know it would be kind of a little bit different than what we normally do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2256.227s">[Bears]</a>: You'd be taking basically a giant driveway and a gas station and seeing if you could do something better with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2260.469s">[Bears]</a>: And I think that's worth trying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2264.511s">[Bears]</a>: So that would be my recommendation is maybe just take a straight line down to those last two parcels and then make all of that commercial that has that Mystic Ave frontage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2274.636s">[Bears]</a>: But then you still have the buffer zone with the park and the residential neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2343.7s">[Bears]</a>: Center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2345.701s">[Bears]</a>: It used to be Russo Marine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2358.705s">[Bears]</a>: Oh, you might want to go to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2360.146s">[Bears]</a>: No one can hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2432.628s">[Bears]</a>: President Burrs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2434.87s">[Bears]</a>: I just will note that on the, and again, if we wanna do a walk or if we wanna just get a little more insight on it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2440.683s">[Bears]</a>: It looks like what might be a Medford Housing Authority maintenance building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2445.464s">[Bears]</a>: Basically the public housing, it looks like there's a large grass buffer and a maintenance building between that lot and the housing units themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2456.867s">[Bears]</a>: Obviously, but the way that the lot goes, it angles closer, the closer you get to Bonner Ave, but certainly where the Walnut Street Center is now versus the large parking lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2467.37s">[Bears]</a>: Basically, that looks like it's abutting a garage and an open grass area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2475.438s">[Bears]</a>: Looks like it's probably at least 100 feet, maybe more, from the housing units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2683.84s">[Bears]</a>: I think this map is deceptive as to what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2687.552s">[Bears]</a>: really what that looks like is four different large buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2692.234s">[Bears]</a>: And the Fulbright Street definition is no different than the definition between the next parcel and the next large parcel visually, if you're looking at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2703.398s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, I could see an argument for mixed use too for that Walnut Street Center lot, but lot size, existing condition, existing use, it feels a lot more similar to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2716.584s">[Bears]</a>: the stuff south and east of it than it does to the things that are north of Bonner, to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2722.371s">[Bears]</a>: So that would be, I'd be inclined to leave it as is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2764.951s">[Bears]</a>: And if I recall them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2766.549s">[Bears]</a>: life sciences combined proposal would have used a piece of that, like they would have tried to get it straight away from the 16 exit and then wrap it around to where to have basically an intersection where the pink purple line is, if I think I'm remembering that right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2913.661s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2917.183s">[Bears]</a>: That was one of my questions, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2922.487s">[Bears]</a>: I do have two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2924.448s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know if they're exactly copy editing kind of more things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2929.665s">[Bears]</a>: On the MX3 max height under the incentive zoning, I just think that that should say podium for tower 10 instead of tower eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2937.247s">[Bears]</a>: Is that a typo?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2950.97s">[Bears]</a>: It's an MX3 max height for incentive zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2965.37s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2966.891s">[Bears]</a>: And then I just have one other question, which was base height versus minimum height.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2975.5s">[Bears]</a>: Is this, is that, did we have that in the last proposal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3005.307s">[Bears]</a>: I think three, a minimum height of three where the base height is four and MX one and MX two, I get that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3012.309s">[Bears]</a>: I just feel like the further, I feel like the four minimum in commercial and certainly in MX three might be a little bit too low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3020.572s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, there'd just be a huge gap if you had a bunch of, if you had a 10 story or a 14 story next to a four story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3028.095s">[Bears]</a>: And I wonder what we think about maybe a higher minimum height for those two districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3123.369s">[Bears]</a>: And I see what you're saying about the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3125.41s">[Bears]</a>: So that makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3132.512s">[Bears]</a>: Those were my questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3209.679s">[Bears]</a>: Sorry, just to clarify, was that across all the zones?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3216.862s">[Bears]</a>: Oh, so just the commercial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3217.883s">[Bears]</a>: I get where you're coming from, but I worry about doing that in an MX3.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3224.866s">[Bears]</a>: I think we might need to have a little bit of a compromise there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3345.404s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3345.784s">[Bears]</a>: And yeah, I mean, I think part of this goes back to the definition of industrial, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3349.488s">[Bears]</a>: If we're talking like fab space and an MX3, that makes sense to me, but I don't think it should be one story or even a double height, single story structure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3358.215s">[Bears]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3358.275s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, my inclination, I think we need to talk about the industrial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3368.069s">[Bears]</a>: go through that industrial list a little bit more and decide what we think makes sense in an MX3 where the minimum height is four stories, and what might make sense in commercial where the minimum height, and maybe the minimum height in commercial is one story, but we can say that it could be double height, or maybe we could say that that ground floor story could have a higher maximum for commercial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3394.468s">[Bears]</a>: I don't love the idea of having a distribution center on Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3399.915s">[Bears]</a>: I get why it was raised as an example, but I just don't think it's highest and best use and where we're trying to go with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3407.946s">[Bears]</a>: So it's just my two cents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3491.311s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, I think the way around it is just to say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3494.679s">[Bears]</a>: In commercial, the max ground floor height can be 30 feet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3499.583s">[Bears]</a>: And if we want to drop it down to one floor, then you could have a double height if you wanted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3505.188s">[Bears]</a>: Drop the minimum down to one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3520.239s">[Bears]</a>: Oh, we could go down to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3521.319s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, if that's what folks think, if that's the only way we're going to keep industrial uses potentially is to have a minimum height in the commercial district of one story, I think that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3533.221s">[Bears]</a>: And that if we need those stories to be tall, I would just change the ground floor maximum to be whatever that height needs to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3594.634s">[Bears]</a>: And if it needs to be 35 feet or 28 feet or whatever you guys think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3598.456s">[Bears]</a>: Something around that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3669.909s">[Bears]</a>: So, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3672.53s">[Bears]</a>: We need a higher dam, that's what I said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3677.832s">[Bears]</a>: It's a grim world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3691.074s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I mean, whatever you... I'm open to whatever you think needs to be the minimum height and the ground floor height to allow the industrial uses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3702.241s">[Bears]</a>: I guess, Sal, if you don't mind me asking from an economic development perspective,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3706.761s">[Bears]</a>: Is the thinking just like we want to have some options left for these kinds of uses or you know why it just feels to me, I mean this like certain things I get like some sort of fab vacation site that's close by to a life science tower that makes sense to me, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3723.814s">[Bears]</a>: Like an Amazon truck distribution site like that doesn't make sense to me, so I guess i'm just wondering what the thought is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3880.37s">[Bears]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3881.29s">[Bears]</a>: I think maybe my motion would then be for this, that the steering committee discuss the industrial uses and whatever height and story height requirements are needed to maintain them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3894.493s">[Bears]</a>: And we kind of come back with a coherent just table that includes those items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3900.735s">[Bears]</a>: Cause I think we have to go back and look at the uses anyway, um, between the MX three and the commercial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3906.396s">[Bears]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3908.735s">[Bears]</a>: And I think to me, that's the last big outstanding question here of all of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3913.317s">[Bears]</a>: But, you know, that's just my opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3939.682s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3940.302s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3940.803s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4650.659s">[Bears]</a>: On my radar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4654.304s">[Bears]</a>: keep the papering committee, refer out the comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4657.987s">[Bears]</a>: Well, I'll just, if you want to take public comment, because I'll just adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4759.205s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, just I agree too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4762.867s">[Bears]</a>: Motion to report out the questions and comments to the steering committee, keep the paper in committee and adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4792.418s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, we have governance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=112.711s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=128.696s">[Bears]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=129.656s">[Bears]</a>: 24475 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=132.691s">[Bears]</a>: be it resolved that the Medford City Council hold a question and answer session to discuss the definitions and terminology regarding the proposed Proposition 2.5 overrides and the proposed debt exclusion measure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=143.871s">[Bears]</a>: To that resolution, the following amendments were added.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=145.993s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli asked that the administration and Council on Aging do outreach to seniors about this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=151.277s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan requested outreach to parents of school-aged children, not just teachers, and specifically requested outreach to the PTOs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=157.722s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Tseng requested general outreach and specifically requested that the community liaisons translate into other languages the information that is on the city website about the overrides and the debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=167.469s">[Bears]</a>: To ensure that the council is able to answer questions in a timely manner and that decorum is maintained, the council president, myself, will be enforcing the following rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=175.016s">[Bears]</a>: One, members of the public will have one minute to ask one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=178.58s">[Bears]</a>: Members of the public will not be able to ask a second question until all who seek to ask a question have had the chance to ask their first question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=185.286s">[Bears]</a>: The president will verbally request that residents not ask duplicative or largely similar questions to questions that have already been answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=191.621s">[Bears]</a>: and may move to the next question if a duplicative or similar question is asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=195.763s">[Bears]</a>: Each Councilor will have up to two minutes to answer per question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=199.045s">[Bears]</a>: The president will verbally request the Councilors not answer if a duplicative or largely similar answer has been given by another Councilor and may move to the next question if a duplicative or similar answer is given.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=209.851s">[Bears]</a>: After members of the public have had the chance to ask their first question, the president will open the floor to either a second question or a short public comment by members of the public in attendance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=218.615s">[Bears]</a>: And before we start, I just want to say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=221.0s">[Bears]</a>: that the council itself is in mourning today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=224.602s">[Bears]</a>: Last night, we lost our city messenger, Larry Lepore, who has served us for many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=229.844s">[Bears]</a>: We will be having some condolence remarks made at our regular meeting that will begin after our committee of the whole meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=237.108s">[Bears]</a>: So I hope that folks will stick around if you knew Larry or otherwise to say a kind word or story that you may have shared with him during his many years serving the city behind this rail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=248.018s">[Bears]</a>: With that, I do want to invite our city assessor, Ted Costigan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=251.439s">[Bears]</a>: The council had requested some answers and updates from him, and I know that he's here to share some information that his office has been working on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=259.182s">[Bears]</a>: So with that, I will go to our assessor, Ted Costigan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=269.406s">[Bears]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=269.847s">[Bears]</a>: And then we'll go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=394.933s">[Bears]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=395.233s">[Bears]</a>: And per council, you mean legal council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=397.114s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know that I was on that email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=399.614s">[Bears]</a>: Was I on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=400.374s">[Bears]</a>: I believe it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=417.092s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=417.913s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=418.213s">[Bears]</a>: She means legal counsel, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=419.574s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=420.174s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=420.814s">[Bears]</a>: Good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=421.194s">[Bears]</a>: I didn't want her to think about this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=424.056s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=425.857s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=426.657s">[Bears]</a>: Um, with that, I'll go to our city assessor and let me know when you want me to put slides up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=443.479s">[Bears]</a>: The new mics are coming on Thursday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=450.024s">[Bears]</a>: Shane's going to come out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=451.365s">[Bears]</a>: He's going to fix it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=452.005s">[Bears]</a>: I hear the chair moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=454.947s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks, Shane.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=487.453s">[Bears]</a>: There we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=488.353s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, shane.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=834.517s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, sure, and just thanks, Ted, I wanna appreciate your hard work getting this done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=839.361s">[Bears]</a>: In October, it usually gets done in January, so it's appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=842.223s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=954.303s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1040.627s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks Ted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1041.247s">[Bears]</a>: Just two more questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1042.888s">[Bears]</a>: One, given your estimates, if neither of the overrides pass based on your estimates, the tax rate would once again be going down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1051.553s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1052.314s">[Bears]</a>: And before today, when you had the approved fiscal 25 values, would it have been possible for anyone to provide an update using anything other than the fiscal 24 values or an estimate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1063.985s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone from the public, not from your office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1076.007s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1077.308s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1077.729s">[Bears]</a>: Any further questions from members of council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1079.15s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1134.332s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1307.286s">[Bears]</a>: So we're going to say that happens every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1362.581s">[Bears]</a>: Generally, the CPA was included in the calculations presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1470.643s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks, Ted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1471.663s">[Bears]</a>: Really appreciate the hard work of your office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1473.904s">[Bears]</a>: Just want to note, certainly this council, and you've shared some recently, has taken several votes to maximize the exemptions allowed by state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1482.249s">[Bears]</a>: If you see anything more that we could do on that front, I believe in 2022, we voted to tie it to the law so that we wouldn't have to constantly be updating it as the state did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1491.852s">[Bears]</a>: If you see anything, please let us know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1493.994s">[Bears]</a>: Certainly our intent is to be maximizing everything, and I believe we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1509.407s">[Bears]</a>: Awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1509.847s">[Bears]</a>: We will do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1510.648s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1511.048s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1512.229s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1513.73s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1514.09s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to read off the rules one more time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1515.592s">[Bears]</a>: We're going to move to question and answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1522.0s">[Bears]</a>: All right, so we're gonna follow the following rules for this part of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1527.244s">[Bears]</a>: Members of the public will have one minute to ask one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1530.186s">[Bears]</a>: Members of the public will not be able to ask a second question until everyone has had a chance to ask their first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1535.83s">[Bears]</a>: I'm gonna verbally request that we not ask duplicative or largely similar questions and may move on to the next question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1542.154s">[Bears]</a>: If a duplicative or similar question is asked, Councilors will have up to two minutes per Councilor to answer each question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1549.653s">[Bears]</a>: I'm requesting the Councilors not provide duplicative or largely similar answers to answers that have been already provided by other Councilors and may move on to the next Councilor for an answer if that happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1560.801s">[Bears]</a>: And after members of the public have had the chance to ask their first question, we'll open the floor to a second question or a short public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1567.885s">[Bears]</a>: And I'm going to be alternating between the chamber and Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1571.588s">[Bears]</a>: So we will start at the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1573.509s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Castagnetti, you'll have one minute to ask a question and then we'll go to Zoom after answers from Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1605.913s">[Bears]</a>: You got your minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1669.406s">[Bears]</a>: Andy, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1669.986s">[Bears]</a>: That's a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1672.747s">[Bears]</a>: Go ahead and say the sentence minutes up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1690.998s">[Bears]</a>: Let's just hold on here, guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1692.399s">[Bears]</a>: Like, I can't believe we're doing this on the first question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1705.948s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Andy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1706.728s">[Bears]</a>: Does anyone have a response?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1707.969s">[Bears]</a>: Your time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1708.97s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone want to answer the question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1711.811s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Lemke, you have two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1758.291s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1760.752s">[Bears]</a>: We'll move on to the next question, unless anyone else has an answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1765.387s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Andy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1766.187s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Michelle B on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1768.909s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1770.389s">[Bears]</a>: And you'll have one minute to ask your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1817.317s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1817.777s">[Bears]</a>: I'll go to Vice President Collins, then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2177.192s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2177.952s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2182.996s">[Bears]</a>: Just gonna say a few things really quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2189.281s">[Bears]</a>: The council, oh, I'll go to, okay, I'll wait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2192.867s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2194.751s">[Bears]</a>: Two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2279.596s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Leming, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2332.756s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, nope, one time, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2335.838s">[Bears]</a>: It's question eight, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2338.62s">[Bears]</a>: And any other councilors wanna go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2341.322s">[Bears]</a>: I'll be quick, give myself two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2345.203s">[Bears]</a>: I just want to list it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2347.647s">[Bears]</a>: Two literacy interventionists, two behavior specialists, one nurse, four teachers, and four department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2352.873s">[Bears]</a>: Those were cuts that were postponed because we used one-time funds this year to plug the hole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2358.3s">[Bears]</a>: There's another 25 positions, two school Councilors, four classroom teachers, two security monitors,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2363.587s">[Bears]</a>: One attendance and re-engagement officer, five paraprofessionals, and 12.2 additional staff members that are on one-time federal funds this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2372.612s">[Bears]</a>: So it's about 35 to 45 staff in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2375.933s">[Bears]</a>: We would not have a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2379.363s">[Bears]</a>: permanent dedicated street and sidewalk crew to use the machines that we already own.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2382.765s">[Bears]</a>: We don't have enough staff in the DPW to actually run those machines four times a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2387.849s">[Bears]</a>: And there would not be significant room for looking at additional compensation for educators, paraprofessionals, and staff in our schools, whether that's just to raise their pay, because it's a contract year, or whether that is when we're talking about extending potentially 10 to 15 minutes to school day to align vocational with the comprehensive high school schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2409.643s">[Bears]</a>: or just to address any issues on time on learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2412.084s">[Bears]</a>: So thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2414.045s">[Bears]</a>: That's what we would lose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2415.906s">[Bears]</a>: We will go to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2417.707s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2419.148s">[Bears]</a>: And you have one minute to ask one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2471.129s">[Bears]</a>: So that's not actually how the tax rates calculated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2474.451s">[Bears]</a>: The assessor just presented the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2476.232s">[Bears]</a>: The levy changes based on the two and a half and new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2481.095s">[Bears]</a>: So it's only about 6 million this year, not 13 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2484.298s">[Bears]</a>: And generally that amount is only going towards fixed costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2489.341s">[Bears]</a>: So we have union contracts, increasing health insurance costs, increasing retirement pension costs, increased costs of materials and pavement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2497.826s">[Bears]</a>: So that's generally what the normal two and a half new growth increase goes towards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2525.102s">[Bears]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2527.093s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2527.994s">[Bears]</a>: Does anyone else want to answer that question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2592.491s">[Bears]</a>: Any other questions from answers from members of the council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2597.633s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, we'll go to the next question on zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2599.914s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Lizzie Charbonneau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2601.955s">[Bears]</a>: Lizzie, you have one minute to ask one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2604.896s">[Bears]</a>: Please provide your name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2665.643s">[Bears]</a>: Go to Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2787.766s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2790.54s">[Bears]</a>: Go to Councilor Leming, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2913.346s">[Bears]</a>: So let me thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2915.202s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2916.083s">[Bears]</a>: Go to Councilor Scarpelli of two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3055.202s">[Bears]</a>: Go to Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3058.063s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Tseng, and then Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3124.732s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3125.112s">[Bears]</a>: The train's gonna zoom in on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3307.334s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3310.814s">[Bears]</a>: I think everybody went on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3312.855s">[Bears]</a>: I'd like to avoid everybody answering every question if we can at all possible, but everyone did give a different answer, which is appreciated context.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3321.76s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just going to be brief myself to ignore my own advice and say, light poles are falling down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3328.284s">[Bears]</a>: We had a meeting two weeks ago where a light pole fell on a public way, and luckily it happened at night, so it didn't hit a car or a person and hurt them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3335.949s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, that's the situation that we're in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3338.79s">[Bears]</a>: We have finally,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3340.106s">[Bears]</a>: appropriated some funds to a capital stabilization fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3342.787s">[Bears]</a>: We have a paper on the meeting at seven o'clock to look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3346.588s">[Bears]</a>: We are in a historic multi-decade deficit where we have massive needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3353.79s">[Bears]</a>: The free cash that is being spoken of is spoken for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3357.079s">[Bears]</a>: It is spoken for, it needs to go to our roads, it needs to go to our schools, it needs to go to fix things that are already broken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3364.464s">[Bears]</a>: And thank you, please stop, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3367.286s">[Bears]</a>: And that's just reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3370.408s">[Bears]</a>: If we use that to plug operating budget holes, we'll have to plug those holes with new revenue in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3376.192s">[Bears]</a>: We can't wait for the new growth from our new zoning, which will take five to 10 years to propagate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3381.796s">[Bears]</a>: And I don't think any of us want more light posts falling in the sink, we certainly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3386.579s">[Bears]</a>: should be grateful that so far they've only been falling at night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3390.221s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3390.542s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to the podium for the next question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3392.863s">[Bears]</a>: You have one minute to ask one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3394.284s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3420.235s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you for your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3421.056s">[Bears]</a>: Would anyone like to answer the question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3426.24s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3528.134s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3528.874s">[Bears]</a>: Any other one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3529.615s">[Bears]</a>: No, that's all I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3531.856s">[Bears]</a>: Two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3657.18s">[Bears]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3660.8s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3663.781s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3678.828s">[Bears]</a>: Rick, Rick, come on, Rick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3681.169s">[Bears]</a>: Don't shout in this room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3682.49s">[Bears]</a>: You know better and you wouldn't take it if you were, you wouldn't take it if you were sitting up here, Rick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3685.911s">[Bears]</a>: Don't, let's not go down this road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3688.083s">[Bears]</a>: Come on, everyone, stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3688.825s">[Bears]</a>: Let's not go down this road, guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3690.468s">[Bears]</a>: It's really not needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3692.112s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan, you have the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3697.702s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, we'll go back to two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3822.115s">[Bears]</a>: 10 seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3835.643s">[Bears]</a>: Wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3835.843s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3837.084s">[Bears]</a>: Tell them the truth, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3838.224s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3841.294s">[Bears]</a>: As a member of the financial task force, it was very clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3845.955s">[Bears]</a>: We actually had a lot of public meetings called fiscal 23 budget process, fiscal 24 budget process, fiscal 25 budget process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3854.118s">[Bears]</a>: I think a lot of folks remember if you're watching those meetings, me sitting in that chair in 2022 and being pretty hard on this mayor because we didn't have the information that we needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3867.503s">[Bears]</a>: and working to establish a task force, working to establish a budget ordinance, working to establish a flow of information, and hear from stakeholders, all the stakeholders that were mentioned in the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3880.017s">[Bears]</a>: What do we need?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3881.178s">[Bears]</a>: What are we not seeing happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3882.659s">[Bears]</a>: Why are we in the situation that we're in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3884.82s">[Bears]</a>: That resulted this year in the earliest budget process we've had with meetings before we got the budget, input from the council and the public before the mayor presented a budget, and a full and accounting of what our serious structural deficit is for our schools and for this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3905.193s">[Bears]</a>: We know that we need more money to do what people want the city to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3909.517s">[Bears]</a>: We're asking the voters to do that, and that's what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3913.818s">[Bears]</a>: If the voters say no, then we will have to make cuts, and we will do that, because that is what the voters decided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3919.259s">[Bears]</a>: If the voters choose to vote yes, then we will have the financial resources that we need to do our jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3925.8s">[Bears]</a>: That is essentially what happened, and that is essentially the choice before us as a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3930.741s">[Bears]</a>: When we want to talk about the financial task force,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3933.402s">[Bears]</a>: was announced in a public meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3935.183s">[Bears]</a>: There are a bunch of public releases from that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3937.585s">[Bears]</a>: Every step of the way, we're starting to meet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3940.327s">[Bears]</a>: Here's what we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3941.829s">[Bears]</a>: Here's what we're considering for the framework.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3943.71s">[Bears]</a>: Here is the final framework.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3945.251s">[Bears]</a>: The specifics were discussed extensively in council meetings and school committee meetings for a year, that these were our budget needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3953.578s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3957.432s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to the podium for the next question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3959.493s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Jones, name and address the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3961.033s">[Bears]</a>: You have a minute for your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3977.48s">[Bears]</a>: And I'm going to give you another 15 seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3979.081s">[Bears]</a>: I just want to say for folks who have joined since I started the meeting,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3982.282s">[Bears]</a>: We're going to be talking about Larry at our meeting after this, and I hope folks have something they want to share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3986.444s">[Bears]</a>: We'll stick around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3987.104s">[Bears]</a>: We want to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3988.885s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4010.526s">[Bears]</a>: Okay, so there was no- It was Councilor Morell before January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4013.349s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Morell, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4085.731s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4086.331s">[Bears]</a>: I'll go to Vice President Collins, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4201.323s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, anyone else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4202.163s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4338.136s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4363.074s">[Bears]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4363.554s">[Bears]</a>: Just, I wanted to answer your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4365.256s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4365.656s">[Bears]</a>: I think you heard a good story, but the fact of the matter is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4371.971s">[Bears]</a>: There were five members of the financial task force, the council president, the council vice president, the chair of the school committee, who's the mayor, the vice chair of the school committee, and the chief of staff for the mayor, who administratively runs city hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4383.54s">[Bears]</a>: Those were the members of the task force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4386.943s">[Bears]</a>: Those were the members of the task force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4389.158s">[Bears]</a>: Did we talk to other people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4390.719s">[Bears]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4391.98s">[Bears]</a>: The $3 million number comes from the school finance director from the fiscal 25 budget process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4397.705s">[Bears]</a>: $500,000 number for the DPW street and sidewalk group comes from the DPW commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4402.349s">[Bears]</a>: The $4 million number for the question eight, that comes also from the fiscal 25 and 24 school budget process from the finance director, from many of the administrators in the Medford public schools talking about, this is what we need to do the things that people are asking us to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4417.462s">[Bears]</a>: And the $30 million bond number for the fire headquarters came from the mayor, the chief of staff, and the fire chief based on the design process for the new headquarters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4427.19s">[Bears]</a>: That's where it came from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4428.692s">[Bears]</a>: It's not a bubble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4429.953s">[Bears]</a>: It's not we didn't talk to anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4431.334s">[Bears]</a>: It's not we made things up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4433.075s">[Bears]</a>: There have been documented meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4434.777s">[Bears]</a>: We talked to other people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4436.098s">[Bears]</a>: We engaged the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4437.799s">[Bears]</a>: folks who have the information in the city and said, if we're trying to address these problems, what would it cost?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4443.805s">[Bears]</a>: And that's what the proposals are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4445.426s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, it's plain as day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4447.288s">[Bears]</a>: We have, again, public statements and documents for a year talking about the process, the membership, the framework, and the final result.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4456.076s">[Bears]</a>: We have budget meetings and documents for over<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4460.103s">[Bears]</a>: two and a half, three years, dozens of recordings of this body and the school committee talking about these needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4467.89s">[Bears]</a>: So I encourage folks to look at the last three budget processes, because they'll pretty much get you exactly the numbers that you'll see on the ballot on November 5th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4475.916s">[Bears]</a>: And that's why we're asking voters to vote yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4477.918s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4480.58s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4565.855s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Jones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4566.636s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4567.097s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Zoom for the next question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4569.26s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Zoe Moutsos.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4571.063s">[Bears]</a>: One minute to ask your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4572.345s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4636.803s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4637.384s">[Bears]</a>: Go to members of the council to answer that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4644.076s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Leming, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4724.48s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4985.971s">[Bears]</a>: They're not needed right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4990.053s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4990.614s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4991.074s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Councilor Calihan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5027.799s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5028.359s">[Bears]</a>: Go to Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5032.901s">[Bears]</a>: Two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5128.295s">[Bears]</a>: 30 seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5132.097s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5134.237s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone else from the council want to go on this question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5138.854s">[Bears]</a>: Just to Councilor Leming's point, there was the $34 million certified balance at the end of June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5143.497s">[Bears]</a>: $6 million went to a stabilization fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5147.018s">[Bears]</a>: $5 million went to a capital stabilization fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5150.06s">[Bears]</a>: $1 million of that has already been spent on emergency capital repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5153.422s">[Bears]</a>: $3 million went to the MSBA feasibility study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5157.364s">[Bears]</a>: The mayor also outlined an additional $9.5 million, $2.5 million for fire department fleet replacements, $2 million for the pension liability, which we have to fund by 2034.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5169.008s">[Bears]</a>: $2 million per year for fiscal year 25 capital improvements, $2 million for fiscal year 26 capital improvements, $1 million to match federal and state money to renovate the Hegner Center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5179.474s">[Bears]</a>: We also have the estimated $15 million that we heard the other week from Assistant Superintendent Cushing to fix the HVAC at the Andrews Middle School and McGlynn K-8 school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5190.3s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan has noted the $67 million in road debt, $35 million in sidewalk debt,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5196.301s">[Bears]</a>: People have noted the school water issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5200.405s">[Bears]</a>: As Mr. Belson said, we made money on those schools, but apparently we did it because we didn't put the right stuff in for water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5206.369s">[Bears]</a>: So I just spent all 35 million right there on things that are urgent, right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5213.275s">[Bears]</a>: We're still gonna have to prioritize these urgent capital needs with that free cash and stabilization fund money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5221.221s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, that's plus there's the money in the stabilization funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5224.824s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I just went beyond that though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5228.027s">[Bears]</a>: It's not a scare tactic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5229.068s">[Bears]</a>: It's just math.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5230.989s">[Bears]</a>: It's just math.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5231.75s">[Bears]</a>: That is the need of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5233.271s">[Bears]</a>: I could not name you a community in the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5235.413s">[Bears]</a>: Is that the math that the task force has?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5236.854s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scavalli, please don't interrupt me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5238.876s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5239.316s">[Bears]</a>: I don't interrupt you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5239.977s">[Bears]</a>: Please don't interrupt me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5241.158s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5243.199s">[Bears]</a>: Those are the figures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5244.1s">[Bears]</a>: Those are our needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5246.442s">[Bears]</a>: Those are the capital needs of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5248.484s">[Bears]</a>: So I think,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5250.902s">[Bears]</a>: The math is pretty clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5254.384s">[Bears]</a>: Go to the podium for our next question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5256.045s">[Bears]</a>: One minute, name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5308.393s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone wanna go for that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5309.433s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5378.642s">[Bears]</a>: It's just a clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5379.742s">[Bears]</a>: It's not a follow-up, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5381.443s">[Bears]</a>: What's the question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5383.384s">[Bears]</a>: Well, we're not doing that, so I'd appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5385.424s">[Bears]</a>: What?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5385.865s">[Bears]</a>: We're just asking one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5391.247s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go, we'll think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5393.347s">[Bears]</a>: Who's next?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5395.548s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5397.429s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just trying to enforce the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5400.25s">[Bears]</a>: Let me rephrase that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5401.19s">[Bears]</a>: I'll think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5402.111s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5405.444s">[Bears]</a>: Oh, we're giving the answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5407.205s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Leming, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5435.424s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, anyone else wanna answer the question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5437.005s">[Bears]</a>: Sure, Mr. President, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5579.356s">[Bears]</a>: 30 seconds?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5579.777s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5581.078s">[Bears]</a>: What is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5581.738s">[Bears]</a>: You're over by 20 seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5584.841s">[Bears]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5587.723s">[Bears]</a>: You'll get it on the next round, I'm sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5589.525s">[Bears]</a>: I'm sure you'll get it on the next round.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5590.626s">[Bears]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5591.867s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone else want to comment here from the council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5593.928s">[Bears]</a>: You already went, Vice President Collins, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5597.912s">[Bears]</a>: No one gets mad when I don't let Councilor Collins talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5602.261s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just trying to enforce the rules here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5603.881s">[Bears]</a>: If you have a quick clarification on the kind of data you're asking for, I'd be interested to hear it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5628.527s">[Bears]</a>: I can answer that and I'll put my clock on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5632.85s">[Bears]</a>: So for much of it, for the school budget, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5637.432s">[Bears]</a>: The school budget director outlined in the budget meetings in April and May and June, this is what would be cut if we didn't have these funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5645.157s">[Bears]</a>: And this is what would have to be cut if we don't have these funds in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5647.858s">[Bears]</a>: So in that case, it is an exact one-to-one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5650.46s">[Bears]</a>: And that's true for all of question seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5652.661s">[Bears]</a>: When we talk about the DPW, the director said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5656.704s">[Bears]</a>: to run the machines four days a week instead of two or four days a month, I need this much staff, this is how much that crew would cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5664.249s">[Bears]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5665.33s">[Bears]</a>: For the debt exclusion for the fire station, Councilor Scarpelli already noted, right, we have bond capacity, we're maxed on our bond capacity, we have a library on the bond capacity, we have a police station on the bond capacity, we have school, MHS labs on the bond capacity, we're pretty much maxed on the bond capacity here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5681.08s">[Bears]</a>: And, okay, well,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5688.785s">[Bears]</a>: You're wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5689.605s">[Bears]</a>: It's in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5690.546s">[Bears]</a>: You're wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5691.066s">[Bears]</a>: I'm not wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5691.767s">[Bears]</a>: I read the thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5694.088s">[Bears]</a>: So when we talk about the information that's available to the public, there's information from the school budget process, from the city budget process that outlines these needs very clearly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5705.695s">[Bears]</a>: There have been charts and tables and narratives and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5711.098s">[Bears]</a>: whatever other form of data analysis you want has likely been presented at these meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5714.824s">[Bears]</a>: So there is information out there, there is data out there, and when we talk about the decisions made by the financial task force, while other members of the city staff were not members of the financial task force,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5726.721s">[Bears]</a>: they were consulted, these issues were discussed with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5729.925s">[Bears]</a>: So that is what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5733.389s">[Bears]</a>: And we can continue to try to present the math and information in a different way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5736.913s">[Bears]</a>: And I'm sure that we will continue to try to get that information out there as best as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5741.738s">[Bears]</a>: But the city has incredible needs, significant needs, and funding is needed to meet them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5749.923s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5750.343s">[Bears]</a>: I only have one hand raised on Zoom, but it's iPhone 109.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5755.049s">[Bears]</a>: If you would please rename yourself so that we know that you're a person, I'll then recognize you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5760.936s">[Bears]</a>: Until then, I'll go to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5762.257s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5763.458s">[Bears]</a>: You have one minute for your questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5812.03s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5815.478s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone wanna go for it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5817.539s">[Bears]</a>: I can do the financial task force part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5820.601s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone wanna talk about the sufficiency of the size of the override?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5826.545s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Leming, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5912.34s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5914.181s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6024.965s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6025.685s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone else want to go on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6027.786s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, anyone else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6029.307s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6188.22s">[Bears]</a>: Sorry, one second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6189.121s">[Bears]</a>: We're still answering the question from Mr. Givino.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6192.625s">[Bears]</a>: I saw Councilor Saint and Councilor Collins, and I have an answer about the financial task force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6211.364s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6301.662s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6302.543s">[Bears]</a>: I think I got it on the task force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6306.869s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks Mr. Gimeno for the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6309.791s">[Bears]</a>: So when we talk about sufficiency of the override, in the public documents that have been repeatedly asserted don't exist, but are of course public and on the website, the financial task force has said that we believe that this override and debt exclusion is sufficient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6324.727s">[Bears]</a>: along with whatever needs to be done for the high school, which we all knew always was going to be an independent question to allow the city's planning and development work based on the comprehensive plan and the zoning recodification and ongoing zoning work to take effect to begin to raise the funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6339.21s">[Bears]</a>: So yes, right now in the public documents that have been released, I think both the March document and the June document talk about that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6347.671s">[Bears]</a>: We believe that not only is this the best path forward for the city's financial health,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6351.412s">[Bears]</a>: but that the amounts are sufficient that we would not be coming back in the next five to 10 years outside of a Medford High School question to address the city's financial health and challenges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6360.463s">[Bears]</a>: When it comes to the Financial Task Force question, Financial Task Force was not a public body, did not include, for example, members of the public, appointed citizens, etc.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6369.033s">[Bears]</a>: It was an internal body to City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6372.034s">[Bears]</a>: similar to project meetings in different departments, interdepartmental groups designed for different projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6380.079s">[Bears]</a>: So that is why it was held internally and not in publicly posted meetings and public meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6389.024s">[Bears]</a>: I'm gonna go to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6391.145s">[Bears]</a>: We have Deanne I. You have one minute for a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6395.107s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6431.638s">[Bears]</a>: I think you said 451, but it sounds like you got the 51 right, so it may have been a misspeak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6444.727s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, sometimes we just have a little misspeak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6449.671s">[Bears]</a>: All right, anyone wanna answer those questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6453.133s">[Bears]</a>: I can get money where the money goes, but if anyone else wants to go for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6459.281s">[Bears]</a>: All right, in terms of where the money goes, $3 million from Question 7 goes to Medford Public Schools to replace $1.7 million in one-time funds that were used for Fiscal 25 to cover positions to address the inclusion of federally funded<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6477.174s">[Bears]</a>: pandemic aid positions and to address maintenance costs, $500,000 would go to DDPW to hire staff to have a permanent in-house road and sidewalk repair crew, and $4 million would go to the school to address a number of issues, mainly collectively bargained issues around pay for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6495.852s">[Bears]</a>: teachers, paraprofessionals, staff, addressing the issue of the school day, and potentially also addressing issues such as coaches, stipends, and transportation, depending on what is prioritized during the next budget process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6509.502s">[Bears]</a>: And for question six, that is dedicated to a new fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6515.846s">[Bears]</a>: I'll go to Councilor Scarpelli and then Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6518.048s">[Bears]</a>: Two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6638.558s">[Bears]</a>: That's what I ask all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6639.999s">[Bears]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6640.959s">[Bears]</a>: Appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6677.626s">[Bears]</a>: It is a sustainable source of revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6705.377s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, specifically it would be appropriated if they were passed, there would be an appropriation in the first year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6711.798s">[Bears]</a>: The appropriation would be as outlined in the ballot questions in future years, budgets would have to be cut in order to reappropriate those funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6720.0s">[Bears]</a>: So, um, and I don't think anyone behind this rail has ever supported cutting teachers or the school budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6730.655s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6731.959s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6733.043s">[Bears]</a>: You have one minute to ask your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6841.314s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you for the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6843.415s">[Bears]</a>: I can go to other folks, but I do have the answer, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6847.537s">[Bears]</a>: So in terms of the temporary versus permanent, question six is a debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6853.08s">[Bears]</a>: So it's temporary in the sense that there's the $30 million amount for the bond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6858.783s">[Bears]</a>: The $2 billion that you cited is an estimate for the annual debt service cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6863.686s">[Bears]</a>: That estimate was created to try to give folks an understanding of what that might look like on an annual basis on their tax impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6871.751s">[Bears]</a>: So that's a temporary until the bond is paid off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6874.574s">[Bears]</a>: For question seven and eight, those would be permanent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6879.899s">[Bears]</a>: Those are overrides intended to be permanent increases to the levy limit to fund ongoing operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6886.686s">[Bears]</a>: In terms of the line items, I believe there is a page on the city website right now that does outline the specifics that I just said in terms of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6895.413s">[Bears]</a>: 3 million for the MPS and 500,000 for the DPW in question seven and the 4 million in question eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6903.54s">[Bears]</a>: I can look at seeing if the city might be able to also add a graphic there, but I believe if you go to medfordma.org, there's a button right on the front page that says override information, and it does outline the line items for each specific question to the greatest extent possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6933.074s">[Bears]</a>: So we do, it would be 3.5 million for question seven and 4 million for question eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6938.455s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6939.195s">[Bears]</a>: And that's the max, it can't go higher than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6942.496s">[Bears]</a>: And those are not funding any sort of bonds or debt exclusions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6945.716s">[Bears]</a>: Those are for the override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6948.917s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6981.208s">[Bears]</a>: That's not the format here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6982.269s">[Bears]</a>: We'll take public comment at the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7084.02s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7086.361s">[Bears]</a>: Just on the point about question six, Department of Revenue guidelines, it can be for the bonded amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7092.706s">[Bears]</a>: It's not written into the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7093.846s">[Bears]</a>: That's because of how the Proposition 2.5 law is written.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7096.633s">[Bears]</a>: but it is for the $30 million plus minor project changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7100.936s">[Bears]</a>: It is not a blank check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7102.337s">[Bears]</a>: It is not just an open thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7103.738s">[Bears]</a>: Department of Revenue has extent, the State Department of Revenue has extensive guidelines on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7108.962s">[Bears]</a>: So if there are minor project changes or construction related inflation adjustments, those could be included, but they have to be minor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7116.588s">[Bears]</a>: If there's a significant increase to the budget, it would have to either be going out for another bond funded by another revenue source or funded by an additional debt exclusion vote of the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7126.843s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7127.243s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to go to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7129.384s">[Bears]</a>: We have Christina Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7131.004s">[Bears]</a>: Christina, you have one minute to ask your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7133.944s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7184.924s">[Bears]</a>: So thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7196.336s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to the podium, name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7199.739s">[Bears]</a>: You have a minute to ask your questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7293.618s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you for the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7295.063s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to members of the Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7296.328s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7341.411s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Leming, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7372.742s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just getting there if we could just maintain decorum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7375.644s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7449.468s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7449.789s">[Bears]</a>: We're going to Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7478.069s">[Bears]</a>: Um, I mean, I can answer the question more specifically or vice president Collins, but, um, if you don't mind, mine is on a different part of the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7485.333s">[Bears]</a>: This what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7487.834s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7488.774s">[Bears]</a>: On this specific question, when we were looking at the financial state of the city, we said, what is the biggest capital obligation that the city is going to have over the next five to 10 years, other than a high school, which we've excluded from everyone acknowledges is such a big project needs to be handled on its own.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7505.74s">[Bears]</a>: It was a new fire headquarters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7507.981s">[Bears]</a>: We can get into the back and forth dispute over should there have been a combined headquarters?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7511.622s">[Bears]</a>: Should this have been 10, 10 years ago?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7514.008s">[Bears]</a>: Those, quite frankly, were decisions that were made before I was even thinking about running for office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7519.817s">[Bears]</a>: When we looked at that, we said, that's the biggest expense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7523.342s">[Bears]</a>: If we ask the voters to do that as a debt exclusion, it means that bond capacity is available for many of the other things that we've talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7530.39s">[Bears]</a>: Now we looked at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7532.172s">[Bears]</a>: There has been an owner's project manager hired by the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7534.935s">[Bears]</a>: The mayor has controlled the design process, has included, my understanding, chiefs, has not included the union or firefighters to the level that they've wanted to be included, and has never included this council in the design process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7547.668s">[Bears]</a>: We're not part of the design process for the fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7550.811s">[Bears]</a>: We made a decision based on the financial health of the community, based on the estimates provided by the designer, the mayor, and the fire chief, that a $30 million fire station is what they think will need to be built.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7561.556s">[Bears]</a>: The design is not finalized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7564.057s">[Bears]</a>: My understanding is that changes can and are being made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7569.38s">[Bears]</a>: But to us, it was a separate question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7571.381s">[Bears]</a>: The design process is not something that this council has been involved in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7576.104s">[Bears]</a>: But the financial health of the community is obviously something that we work on during the budget process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7581.469s">[Bears]</a>: And so identifying this project as what should be funded by a debt exclusion was how we made that decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7590.138s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7591.139s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7625.592s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7627.434s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7752.98s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7755.901s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you for this question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7760.402s">[Bears]</a>: All right, we'll go to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7764.275s">[Bears]</a>: I'm a little wary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7765.497s">[Bears]</a>: Bill on Zoom, if you could provide a last name or a last initial, we'll go to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7770.825s">[Bears]</a>: Damon, address record, you have a minute to ask your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7817.622s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7818.002s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, I will give you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7819.713s">[Bears]</a>: I wasn't expecting you to go around the rules here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7822.455s">[Bears]</a>: My point was not that the people involved did a bad job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7825.037s">[Bears]</a>: My point was clearly this was an issue that was missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7828.26s">[Bears]</a>: And there was a comment made by someone very involved in those projects at a political event, quote, we made money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7836.487s">[Bears]</a>: And I think that that's just something that should be entertained as maybe also maybe not representing the work or the goals of that committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7844.994s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7845.794s">[Bears]</a>: So you can have your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7855.8s">[Bears]</a>: I've sat down with some people who are on that committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7858.021s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7860.682s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7861.202s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7863.339s">[Bears]</a>: You have a minute to ask your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7905.822s">[Bears]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7906.162s">[Bears]</a>: I know I'm going to go for that two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7908.884s">[Bears]</a>: Council vice president Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8031.82s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8032.26s">[Bears]</a>: We're not going back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8033.481s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone else want to go on this question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8034.762s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8134.03s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8138.153s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8139.434s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8139.734s">[Bears]</a>: We, we can talk about water sewer infrastructure for another couple hours if we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8145.277s">[Bears]</a>: Um, it's a big problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8147.078s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone else have a answer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8148.499s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Lenders question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8149.8s">[Bears]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8150.26s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8271.309s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8273.973s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8356.223s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8359.69s">[Bears]</a>: Just to get specific, when we talk about the needs in the classroom, 85% of the school budget is salaries and staff, 15% is non-salary and staff expenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8369.958s">[Bears]</a>: Likely the vast majority of both of these questions through collective bargaining will end up going to either hiring more staff or paying existing staff more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8378.181s">[Bears]</a>: The specifics outlined in the fiscal 25 budget process by the schools are eight classroom teachers, five paraprofessionals, two literacy interventionists, two behavior specialists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8389.346s">[Bears]</a>: I think those are all significant impact on the students in the room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8392.928s">[Bears]</a>: A nurse, a school administrative assistant at the McGlynn, which right now is operating with one administrative assistant instead of two for a complex of over 1,000 kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8402.392s">[Bears]</a>: We could say those aren't in the classroom, but I think we know those would help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8405.188s">[Bears]</a>: in the classroom and help kids as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8407.309s">[Bears]</a>: So those are the real life impacts of what this would go to fund, nevermind the idea of paying paraprofessionals a living wage, hiring more staff to reduce class sizes or other things that would be possible through the collective bargaining process with the teachers union and the paraprofessionals union.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8425.68s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8428.862s">[Bears]</a>: We have Bill O'Brien, name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8431.503s">[Bears]</a>: You have a minute to ask your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8488.026s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8490.871s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone have questions or answers on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8493.573s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Leming, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8533.271s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, anyone else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8534.952s">[Bears]</a>: Sure, Mr. President, if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8536.072s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8673.226s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8675.766s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8813.194s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8814.895s">[Bears]</a>: I'll leave it there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8815.636s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8821.8s">[Bears]</a>: Number one, I appreciate your comments, Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8824.741s">[Bears]</a>: Number two, I wanna say very clearly to the question, why did we pass the budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8829.224s">[Bears]</a>: When I'm talking about, someone have their phone on, someone watching in the room?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8837.31s">[Bears]</a>: If you could take that out of the room, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8841.253s">[Bears]</a>: Well, you gotta, just don't wanna have it backlogging in the, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8848.364s">[Bears]</a>: Just to be clear, to answer the question, when we're talking about collective bargaining agreements, we're talking about future contracts, not current contracts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8856.109s">[Bears]</a>: As was noted, that's not recommended by, I think, councilors who disagree on the substance, it's not recommended to use free cash for operating budget issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8864.135s">[Bears]</a>: Certainly it's not recommended to use free cash to negotiate contracts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8869.018s">[Bears]</a>: So we're talking about the capacity of the city to negotiate future contracts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8873.441s">[Bears]</a>: I think that was the question asked by Mr. O'Brien.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8878.39s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to the podium, name and address the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8881.051s">[Bears]</a>: You have one minute to ask your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8963.979s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8964.459s">[Bears]</a>: We're over by about 20 seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8979.391s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you for your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8981.732s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone want to take it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8989.698s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9061.479s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9062.6s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9065.021s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9065.821s">[Bears]</a>: Please stop interrupting the proceedings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9067.862s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9069.063s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Leving, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9075.165s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9075.465s">[Bears]</a>: It looks like she left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9077.526s">[Bears]</a>: Oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9078.627s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9078.967s">[Bears]</a>: Good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9139.485s">[Bears]</a>: Talking with the assessor's office, their estimate is that given declining interest rates for municipal bonds, given the contingency already in the project, and also the DLS, sorry, DOR, State Department of Revenue guidelines around debt exclusions, that it would essentially stay around the $30 million total cost for the debt service, for the bond, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9167.54s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, but the interest rate would be,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9169.617s">[Bears]</a>: set when the debt is issued.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9172.878s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Zoom, Sharon Diesso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9177.04s">[Bears]</a>: Oh, sorry, you wanna go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9180.041s">[Bears]</a>: Sorry, I didn't see your hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9181.662s">[Bears]</a>: Go ahead, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9182.862s">[Bears]</a>: Sharon, you have to wait a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9237.509s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think anyone's saying that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9299.379s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Sharon or Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9348.618s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9349.139s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9351.38s">[Bears]</a>: Sharon Diesso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9352.14s">[Bears]</a>: You have one minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9354.401s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9355.701s">[Bears]</a>: Please ask your one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9404.908s">[Bears]</a>: Do you have a question, Sharon?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9406.448s">[Bears]</a>: You have 10 seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9437.343s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Sharon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9441.706s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just following the rules, guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9443.187s">[Bears]</a>: I think everyone needs to take a deep breath before groaning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9451.172s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone wanna go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9451.793s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, anybody?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9458.34s">[Bears]</a>: Her question was, what were the alternatives that could have been found that are not the overrides and debt exclusions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9595.656s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9596.076s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9598.715s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Leming, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9684.803s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9686.67s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone else on these questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9691.432s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9693.173s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Sanz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9695.194s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9697.755s">[Bears]</a>: Just to be brief, you know, we have had for the last three years, the best three years of new growth in the city in the last 25 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9706.498s">[Bears]</a>: Those are just, again, the facts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9707.959s">[Bears]</a>: They're on the DLS webpage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9710.58s">[Bears]</a>: We can't disagree with data and mathematics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9713.423s">[Bears]</a>: Data and mathematics are not fear tactics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9716.085s">[Bears]</a>: They are just the facts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9718.867s">[Bears]</a>: Alternatives, there was no way in the short to medium term to raise reliable, recurring, sustainable revenue to fund operating budget expenses, except for asking the voters to fund those expenses through an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9731.919s">[Bears]</a>: The property tax levy is the vast majority of the money that the city brings in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9736.243s">[Bears]</a>: The state is not providing the city with significant new aid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9739.687s">[Bears]</a>: The city departments go above and beyond finding federal and state grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9743.391s">[Bears]</a>: They are looking far and wide for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9746.495s">[Bears]</a>: Just because we don't receive them doesn't mean we didn't apply for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9750.399s">[Bears]</a>: And to be honest, a lot of the formulas and ways that those things are decided are not favoring places like Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9756.065s">[Bears]</a>: because the state school formula looks at our city and they say, Oh, they should pay more in property taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9761.888s">[Bears]</a>: We're not going to send them more state aid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9763.589s">[Bears]</a>: That's literally how the formula is written.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9765.39s">[Bears]</a>: It's based on capacity for a city to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9768.532s">[Bears]</a>: So when we are 93rd out of 97 for property tax revenue, when we are 94th out of 97 for per capita spending, we are where we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9777.056s">[Bears]</a>: The state's judges us based on that reality and says, we're not giving them more money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9782.719s">[Bears]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9784.625s">[Bears]</a>: Again, we came together over dozens of public meetings over three budget cycles addressing needs of the city and the school department and said, this is the best way to raise sustainable recurring revenue to fund city operating budget expenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9798.579s">[Bears]</a>: We believe this is the best path forward in the short to medium term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9801.562s">[Bears]</a>: And we are going to ask the voters to make that decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9803.625s">[Bears]</a>: The voters are, the voters are going to vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9806.209s">[Bears]</a>: We'll see what happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9807.31s">[Bears]</a>: I certainly hope they vote one way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9809.191s">[Bears]</a>: Other Councilors may hope that they vote another way, but I don't envy anyone in any, I don't think any of us are going to be excited to do the budget if these funds are not available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9823.422s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to the podium, name and address record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9825.264s">[Bears]</a>: You have one minute to ask your question, name and address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9851.893s">[Bears]</a>: Please address your questions through the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9891.094s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Merritt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9894.396s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone wanna go for that one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9896.257s">[Bears]</a>: I have some answers on the Cambridge fire station, why it's not a good comparison, but go to Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9909.422s">[Bears]</a>: The Cambridge Fire Station was a historic renovation of a historic 125-year-old fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9915.627s">[Bears]</a>: They were installing geothermal energy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9919.31s">[Bears]</a>: It's just completely incomparable to the project that we're talking about in Medford Square, which is a knockdown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9926.115s">[Bears]</a>: Again, the cost overruns were mainly due to historic preservation issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9930.118s">[Bears]</a>: and projects that they were trying to add in there that are not things that we're trying to add to our station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9935.102s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone else on the question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9939.305s">[Bears]</a>: Seat down, we'll go to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9940.366s">[Bears]</a>: We have Micah Kesselman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9941.607s">[Bears]</a>: Micah, you have one minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9942.708s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9945.39s">[Bears]</a>: Please ask one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10006.05s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10006.591s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone want to go for that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10013.581s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Leming, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10020.306s">[Bears]</a>: I think the question was specifically, how would free cash become a sustainable solution for ongoing operating expenses?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10064.514s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10065.174s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10065.754s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, question is how would free cash be a sustainable solution?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10193.5s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Stroud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10196.421s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone else on this question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10199.682s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, we'll go to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10202.748s">[Bears]</a>: Is it Simon?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10204.289s">[Bears]</a>: All right, Simon, you might have to bend the microphone down a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10210.272s">[Bears]</a>: Oh, nevermind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10218.657s">[Bears]</a>: A direct and simple question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10220.117s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone want to go on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10222.879s">[Bears]</a>: I'll go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10225.24s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10282.21s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10284.231s">[Bears]</a>: I'll take this one, Simon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10285.811s">[Bears]</a>: I'll go to Anna, and then I'll go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10287.832s">[Bears]</a>: Anna?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10344.255s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10344.795s">[Bears]</a>: And Simon, thank you for asking your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10347.056s">[Bears]</a>: I know you've been at a few of these meetings now and you've asked a few questions now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10351.058s">[Bears]</a>: I know you remember some meetings from the springtime of the school committee where we were really worried about whether we were going to be able to keep all the teachers and the paraprofessionals and all the other people in your school who try to make your day a good day and make sure you learn something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10365.743s">[Bears]</a>: Um, we were able, uh, this year to keep most of those people by using the one-time funds that we're talking about, um, that the city had staved up, but in the long run, um, it's really difficult, uh, for us to keep that promise if we don't have the money to keep paying people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10385.098s">[Bears]</a>: So, um, question seven, as Anna noted, um, would allow us to make sure that we can keep everybody on, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10393.677s">[Bears]</a>: who's there now, we don't have to look at asking people to leave, firing people, laying people off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10399.662s">[Bears]</a>: And question eight means that the city and the schools have a lot more opportunity to give our teachers and the people in your school the pay that they deserve to have more staff in the schools to help out in the classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10413.633s">[Bears]</a>: And if we don't,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10414.87s">[Bears]</a>: see a yes vote on those two questions, it's going to be a lot harder for the city to do those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10419.214s">[Bears]</a>: So, um, we're, we're going to do our best no matter what happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10423.118s">[Bears]</a>: And one hard thing about democracy that you might be learning pretty young is sometimes people don't agree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10429.203s">[Bears]</a>: And sometimes people make a decision that you don't want them to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10431.905s">[Bears]</a>: And if that happens, we're going to do our very best to try to make sure that everything stays okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10436.47s">[Bears]</a>: Um, but if people do say yes, it'll be easier for us to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10441.014s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10444.421s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10448.423s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10450.584s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10451.805s">[Bears]</a>: We have Jess H. Name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10455.546s">[Bears]</a>: You have one minute to ask one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10505.281s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you for your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10506.422s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Councilor Collins and Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10570.148s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10570.708s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10646.27s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone else on this question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10651.384s">[Bears]</a>: I can just note quickly that the one-time funds used to avoid cuts this year that were postponed saved two literacy interventionists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10662.851s">[Bears]</a>: I think two positions were eliminated and those could be restored.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10669.816s">[Bears]</a>: There's also talk about the curriculum around literacy and what that would take to implement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10676.741s">[Bears]</a>: I do agree with Councilor Lazzaro that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10679.775s">[Bears]</a>: talking to school committee, school administration, they'd be able to provide more information and details.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10684.359s">[Bears]</a>: And I don't know if either of those solutions would help your child or your specific situation, but I do know that paying our paraprofessionals more to reduce turnover, help students with disabilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10695.909s">[Bears]</a>: I know that investing more in interventionists and specialists helps our students with disabilities and the school having more resources to do that would help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10705.658s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10712.793s">[Bears]</a>: The person on Zoom is Micah Kesselman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10716.162s">[Bears]</a>: So we'll go back to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10718.047s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10719.13s">[Bears]</a>: You have one minute to ask one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10850.007s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10851.869s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone want to talk about that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10854.872s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10938.801s">[Bears]</a>: I believe that's based on time on learning statistics issued by the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10947.187s">[Bears]</a>: Well, I believe that's where the information is coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10949.048s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelliletti, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11081.215s">[Bears]</a>: That's two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11081.956s">[Bears]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11082.837s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11083.397s">[Bears]</a>: Could you please, next time, give me that 10 seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11085.199s">[Bears]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11085.739s">[Bears]</a>: No, I appreciate it a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11087.261s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11087.701s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11201.818s">[Bears]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11252.639s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11253.28s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11280.79s">[Bears]</a>: Let's just take a pause here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11284.153s">[Bears]</a>: It's been three hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11287.315s">[Bears]</a>: The state formula doesn't work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11289.136s">[Bears]</a>: Hold on, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11289.917s">[Bears]</a>: Can I speak, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11290.757s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11292.637s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11293.718s">[Bears]</a>: Three hours in, we've been pretty good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11295.338s">[Bears]</a>: I appreciate everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11297.459s">[Bears]</a>: We've had a difficult conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11303.642s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think anyone, I think there's been a lot of back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11307.244s">[Bears]</a>: Cheryl, I don't want to talk about commenting on aggressiveness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11310.505s">[Bears]</a>: We can interpret people's comments in many ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11312.726s">[Bears]</a>: I think you would agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11313.907s">[Bears]</a>: You don't want unfavorable interpretation of your comments and neither does councilor Zara.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11316.728s">[Bears]</a>: And I think we're going to leave it at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11321.088s">[Bears]</a>: To your point, we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11322.728s">[Bears]</a>: We constantly advocate for more state money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11324.649s">[Bears]</a>: To your point, and I'm putting my two minutes on now, the state formula is not good for Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11330.511s">[Bears]</a>: Even with the Student Opportunity Act, even with Chapter 70 money, given the charter formula, given the reimbursement formula, it's bad for Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11337.513s">[Bears]</a>: Even with a 5% increase in ELL, which is one of the big sources of funding in the Chapter 70 formula, we're not getting a lot more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11345.196s">[Bears]</a>: The main reason for that is because of our estimated<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11348.41s">[Bears]</a>: you know, minimum contribution as a city, what the state plans to give us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11352.572s">[Bears]</a>: And a lot of that is based on what is the city's capacity to pay for things itself versus the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11358.336s">[Bears]</a>: Malden gets $60 million a year in net aid for their schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11362.638s">[Bears]</a>: We get 11.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11366.359s">[Bears]</a>: Well, I mean, you know, I would, I would love to, I would love if the formula treated us better, but it doesn't because essentially because of our property values.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11374.549s">[Bears]</a>: I wanted to get to your point, um, specifically on these questions, question eight, it's not just for the high school schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11383.74s">[Bears]</a>: It's that's one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11385.131s">[Bears]</a>: That's one of three things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11386.232s">[Bears]</a>: It's high school schedule alignment so that vocational and arts kids can do both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11391.036s">[Bears]</a>: It's expanding classroom instructional opportunities district-wide, whether that means more staff or more teachers, and it's classroom teacher and paraprofessional compensation, so paying existing staff more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11405.952s">[Bears]</a>: I can read you the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11407.113s">[Bears]</a>: Shall the city of Medford be allowed to assess an additional $4 million in real estate and personal property taxes for FY 25 general operations of the Medford Public Schools to create a high school schedule that increases access to arts and vacational programming, expand classroom instructional opportunities, and for classroom teacher and paraprofessional compensation for the fiscal year beginning July 1st, 2024?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11426.57s">[Bears]</a>: That's the whole question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11428.032s">[Bears]</a>: It's for all three of those purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11429.98s">[Bears]</a>: The district spends 85% of its budget on salaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11433.143s">[Bears]</a>: And the reason it's not more specific is because to get more specific would be to violate collective bargaining laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11437.746s">[Bears]</a>: All of that has to be bargained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11439.628s">[Bears]</a>: So it gives us the money to have that conversation with our educators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11443.491s">[Bears]</a>: And these have been ongoing questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11445.172s">[Bears]</a>: So I'm really hopeful it passes because I'd like to pay our teachers more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11448.815s">[Bears]</a>: I'd like to pay our paraprofessionals more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11450.857s">[Bears]</a>: And I'd also like to fix the school day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11456.628s">[Bears]</a>: We're going to move to the next question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11459.33s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11461.292s">[Bears]</a>: Matt, let me run the meeting today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11463.073s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11465.975s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to the podium because the person on Zoom has already asked a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11469.437s">[Bears]</a>: Name, address, record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11470.158s">[Bears]</a>: You have one minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11492.27s">[Bears]</a>: Is that the whole question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11494.351s">[Bears]</a>: Cause I know the rest of the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11525.621s">[Bears]</a>: I'll give you 10 more seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11563.731s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you for the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11564.651s">[Bears]</a>: Does anyone want to go for it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11566.613s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Collins, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11658.775s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone else want to go on this question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11664.257s">[Bears]</a>: Anybody else on the question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11665.237s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11668.278s">[Bears]</a>: I'll just say for one bill, I'll go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11670.998s">[Bears]</a>: I think it's actually a symptom of the same problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11674.298s">[Bears]</a>: to go 25 years without addressing and correcting that issue is the same reason that we're talking about all the other deferred questions, deferred issues, deferred things in the scope of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11686.737s">[Bears]</a>: 25 years of not adjusting that compensation amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11689.426s">[Bears]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11689.747s">[Bears]</a>: It went from 2000 to 2024 without being adjusted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11693.452s">[Bears]</a>: And so I think it's actually a symptom of the same problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11698.179s">[Bears]</a>: I'm not going to discuss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11699.701s">[Bears]</a>: I'm talking in the big picture, Bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11701.945s">[Bears]</a>: We're talking about on every single thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11706.425s">[Bears]</a>: basically every single thing in the city, water, sewer, school buildings, fire station, funding of the DPW staff, funding of paraprofessional pay, the school day, the vocational.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11716.255s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, I could give you a 30 point litany list of things that the city spent 20 or 30 or 40 years not fixing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11723.837s">[Bears]</a>: This was one of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11724.658s">[Bears]</a>: It was within our authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11725.799s">[Bears]</a>: It's a symptom of that larger problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11727.922s">[Bears]</a>: We fixed that one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11729.484s">[Bears]</a>: Now we're asking the voters to fix a larger set of problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11732.587s">[Bears]</a>: And I don't think those things are incongruous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11734.229s">[Bears]</a>: That's just my opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11735.631s">[Bears]</a>: And I appreciate your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11854.256s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11855.077s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone else on this question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11856.358s">[Bears]</a>: I see none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11858.52s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to the podium, name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11860.381s">[Bears]</a>: You have one minute to ask one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11918.086s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone want to go on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11922.359s">[Bears]</a>: I really should be going last here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12045.0s">[Bears]</a>: I'd like to not go back and forth guys<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12050.0s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you um go to vice president Collins: two minutes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12088.265s">[Bears]</a>: Are you asking for a clarification?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12091.578s">[Bears]</a>: If you're asking for a clarification, you can clarify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12094.599s">[Bears]</a>: Okay, all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12097.281s">[Bears]</a>: Just to your point, to your question, yes, we're talking about fiscal 26.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12101.362s">[Bears]</a>: Teachers contract, Paris contract, both expired June 30, 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12104.223s">[Bears]</a>: So we're talking about a new contract year and the increased pay for that would be on the new year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12110.206s">[Bears]</a>: That's if there are no agreements or side agreements settled before then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12113.867s">[Bears]</a>: You know, we're seeing significant costs, essentially,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12118.576s">[Bears]</a>: all of the two and a half increase and most of the new growth increase are being used to pay for fixed cost growth increases on things that we've already committed to do, either in contracts or where we have mandatory spending on health insurance and pensions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12130.328s">[Bears]</a>: So, yes, this would be for fiscal 26.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12133.171s">[Bears]</a>: We're currently, once again, this year, we're doing basically what Councilor Scarpelli said, we're using one-time funds right now to cover the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12141.144s">[Bears]</a>: to try to get us through to a point when we have reliable recurring revenue, which the financial task force has put forward in the form of these overrides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12148.01s">[Bears]</a>: And if that is not available, that's when in the it's next year, but it's the budget process is going to happen from February to June upcoming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12155.696s">[Bears]</a>: It's in the next few months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12157.498s">[Bears]</a>: That's when those decisions will be made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12158.959s">[Bears]</a>: And whether or not we know we have the reliable, sustainable revenue to pay for those things, or we don't is dependent on the override questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12167.967s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12206.26s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12207.721s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone else on the question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12210.682s">[Bears]</a>: All right, we'll go to another question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12213.524s">[Bears]</a>: Still someone who's already asked on Zoom, so we'll go to first time question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12218.946s">[Bears]</a>: Two minutes, or one minute, one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12221.487s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12318.951s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12319.471s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12322.473s">[Bears]</a>: Two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12469.249s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Collins, I let you go way over, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12470.91s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12471.231s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12472.912s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12473.152s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12473.733s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Leming, two minutes, then Councilor Lazzaro, then Councilor Tseng, then Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12574.71s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12578.697s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Tseng, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12580.137s">[Bears]</a>: Or did I get that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12580.798s">[Bears]</a>: Or was it Councilor Lazzaro?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12582.058s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12841.433s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12844.395s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12898.137s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12898.677s">[Bears]</a>: I just wanted to, I did have a couple quick answers to your question too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12904.491s">[Bears]</a>: It's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12905.411s">[Bears]</a>: Bill keeps posting online something I posted, I think about five years ago where I said, I don't think we need an override right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12910.994s">[Bears]</a>: I want to explore all the other options first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12913.314s">[Bears]</a>: And then we did, we explored short-term rentals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12915.615s">[Bears]</a>: We explored marijuana revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12917.076s">[Bears]</a>: We started on the zoning, which has borne some fruit and will bear more, but not fast enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12923.598s">[Bears]</a>: You know, we maxed out the local fees and stuff like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12927.987s">[Bears]</a>: the hotel meals and rooms, et cetera, to the most, the state will let us do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12932.97s">[Bears]</a>: We're trying to get the state to open up the home roll petition so we can update the linkage fees for the first time in 30 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12938.393s">[Bears]</a>: I had a resolution on for a fee schedule update to look at the whole city fee schedule to which many of them haven't been updated in many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12948.478s">[Bears]</a>: So we're going to get a response back on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12950.64s">[Bears]</a>: All of that does not generate a significant enough amount of revenue to address the needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12954.742s">[Bears]</a>: That's why I feel that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12957.327s">[Bears]</a>: in all the six years of budgets that I've worked on and everything else, my answer to the question is, we've looked at all the other buckets that we have control over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12966.849s">[Bears]</a>: They're no longer sufficient to address the need, and that's why I support these overrides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12970.91s">[Bears]</a>: So that's just one piece of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12974.07s">[Bears]</a>: On the development, Somerville started its significant summer vision plans 20, 25 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12980.092s">[Bears]</a>: They started seeing the first fruits of that in significant way 15 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12984.292s">[Bears]</a>: It's really boomed the last five to 10 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12987.333s">[Bears]</a>: We're at the beginning of that process, not the middle, not the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12990.255s">[Bears]</a>: I wish we'd started that 25 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12992.196s">[Bears]</a>: I think I'd be much happier during budget season if we started that 25 years ago, because the decisions would be a lot easier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12999.561s">[Bears]</a>: We're doing it now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13000.542s">[Bears]</a>: It's starting to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13001.542s">[Bears]</a>: I agree with Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13003.644s">[Bears]</a>: I don't agree with some of the legal proceedings that happened around 40Bs, but it's not the wholesome question here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13010.348s">[Bears]</a>: Last thing I'll say, you started out with the teacher's compensation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13014.141s">[Bears]</a>: Having talked to our teachers, having heard from our teachers union, our paraprofessionals union in this space and in the school committee, I know they don't feel like their compensation is sufficient and competitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13022.946s">[Bears]</a>: I know many of them feel pressure to leave for other districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13026.388s">[Bears]</a>: And I also know when it comes to benefits that there's been ongoing negotiation issues around the healthcare benefit for all of our employees, police, fire, DPW, city hall and the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13036.494s">[Bears]</a>: So just wanted to put that perspective out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13039.816s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13042.534s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13044.195s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13045.476s">[Bears]</a>: One minute for one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13089.281s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you for the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13090.001s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone want to go for it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13213.621s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13213.981s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13319.545s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13319.745s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13321.065s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13407.123s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13408.604s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13588.611s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks, Danielle, I'm going to put on my two minutes here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13592.294s">[Bears]</a>: And just say, a when we were discussing this, the reason that I support this is that I believe a debt exclusion is the best mechanism to fund the construction of a new fire headquarters in the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13602.978s">[Bears]</a>: When we're having the conversations, we have had some of the discussions that we've had over the last two months since the question came out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13610.103s">[Bears]</a>: As you've noted, we weren't involved deeply in the planning process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13613.325s">[Bears]</a>: There was an OPM that said, this is going to be the estimated cost of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13618.268s">[Bears]</a>: Here's this number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13619.809s">[Bears]</a>: And when we looked at the capital spending for the next five or 10 years, that's the biggest item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13624.292s">[Bears]</a>: Sorry, I have a cold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13625.873s">[Bears]</a>: I have something in my mouth, so it sounded a little funky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13631.052s">[Bears]</a>: That is my rationale here, that this is the best way to fund a new headquarters in a timely manner and get it built.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13637.455s">[Bears]</a>: I tend to agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13638.796s">[Bears]</a>: I've read some of the stuff that has been put online when we're talking about the phased red, yellow, green, getting people out of that red zone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13647.487s">[Bears]</a>: when we're talking about the arrangement on that second floor of the rooms and the showers and not being enough showers and bathrooms, I do believe that both of those would fall under the DOR regulations around minor project changes because they would be, you know, changes on the, essentially on the floor plan where things are, how many versions of things are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13666.722s">[Bears]</a>: If there's something bigger than that, if we're talking about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13670.423s">[Bears]</a>: that would be something that would have to go further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13675.227s">[Bears]</a>: There are options on that front.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13678.11s">[Bears]</a>: If it is a little bit over the 30 million, if we are talking about 35 instead of 30, you could go out to the bond capacity to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13687.077s">[Bears]</a>: I would certainly be open to those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13688.559s">[Bears]</a>: I have appreciated some of the dialogue that has been out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13690.781s">[Bears]</a>: I agree with councilmember<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13696.055s">[Bears]</a>: the mayor and you, the fire union could get to a better place and be at a more collaborative place and that people would feel like their voices are being heard and included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13705.802s">[Bears]</a>: I don't believe that the plan that's out there right now is the final plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13708.484s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think it will be the final plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13710.045s">[Bears]</a>: I expect that things will be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13712.207s">[Bears]</a>: Um, and I certainly expect that this council, if some of those changes are significant, would be supportive of providing additional funding for those changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13719.112s">[Bears]</a>: So that's my position on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13720.713s">[Bears]</a>: I tend to agree with some of my fellow Councilors around the timing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13723.615s">[Bears]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13725.461s">[Bears]</a>: as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13725.902s">[Bears]</a>: You know, we put it in this package because we believe this package is the one thing we're going to have to ask for other than a new high school until we start seeing that new growth be enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13734.61s">[Bears]</a>: So that's where I'm at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13736.232s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13740.436s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13741.458s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks, Danielle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13742.098s">[Bears]</a>: Next question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13742.759s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13744.501s">[Bears]</a>: You have one minute to ask one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13796.324s">[Bears]</a>: I'll go to Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13800.605s">[Bears]</a>: Two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13924.533s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13925.814s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14009.551s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, anyone else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14011.172s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14163.088s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14163.969s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14165.23s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone else here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14165.83s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Levee, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14289.596s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14292.489s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to go really quickly here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14294.109s">[Bears]</a>: I think there's some questions around division.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14300.43s">[Bears]</a>: We are at an inflection point as a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14302.631s">[Bears]</a>: The community is changing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14304.811s">[Bears]</a>: We're looking at new growth and development for the first time really seriously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14308.752s">[Bears]</a>: We're talking about decades of deferred maintenance and underinvestment that are coming up now that we need to address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14314.933s">[Bears]</a>: And I understand that paying more is a hard choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14318.894s">[Bears]</a>: I think it's a hard choice for everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14320.034s">[Bears]</a>: I think some people feel<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14321.775s">[Bears]</a>: that it's a choice that they can make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14323.655s">[Bears]</a>: Some people feel like it's a choice that they can't make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14327.296s">[Bears]</a>: But we have difficult decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14329.357s">[Bears]</a>: And one of those difficult decisions is to ask people to pay for the things that the city needs to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14337.258s">[Bears]</a>: It's a very difficult decision frame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14338.559s">[Bears]</a>: We've talked about all the different things that the city needs to pay for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14342.759s">[Bears]</a>: I firmly believe, and my approach has been that the best thing we can do<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14346.241s">[Bears]</a>: is ask the questions, present the information, get the budget out there, and then ask the voters to either elect people to make choices, which is most of the decisions, or even to make the choice themselves, which is what we're talking about with this proposition with questions six, seven, and eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14364.849s">[Bears]</a>: One thing I'll say is I don't call opposition talking points for your tactics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14368.71s">[Bears]</a>: I don't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14370.231s">[Bears]</a>: I don't say the opposition is dividing the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14373.232s">[Bears]</a>: That's just something I don't do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14376.138s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli talks about the meetings that we should all look at to see what's happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14381.839s">[Bears]</a>: I'm pointing to people to those exact same meetings to watch those exact same meetings, because I think if they watch them, they'll see things from the perspective that I experienced those meetings from, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14391.262s">[Bears]</a>: At the end of the day, we're not perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14394.563s">[Bears]</a>: Sometimes things get divisive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14396.143s">[Bears]</a>: Sometimes certainly I react here or when I sat down there in a way that I'm not happy about, that's a little more divisive or a little more pointed than I wanted it to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14405.314s">[Bears]</a>: And I try to do better every time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14407.275s">[Bears]</a>: I try to learn from those issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14409.795s">[Bears]</a>: And I think at the end of the day, there will always be outstanding questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14413.737s">[Bears]</a>: There will always be a process that could have been longer, that could have been better, that the rules could have been looked at differently, that people could have had more time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14422.86s">[Bears]</a>: And I think you have to balance that against the priorities and the time that we need to make a choice, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14428.341s">[Bears]</a>: We could have a process for 10 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14431.458s">[Bears]</a>: And there's still be people with outstanding questions who aren't happy with the end of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14435.601s">[Bears]</a>: And at the end of the day, I think that's what democracy is about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14437.863s">[Bears]</a>: This has been a four-hour discussion of major tensions that people have, answering questions, trying to get to a point of agreement and stay in respectful dialogue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14446.63s">[Bears]</a>: And I think that's the best that we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14449.592s">[Bears]</a>: And at the end of the day, the voters will decide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14451.313s">[Bears]</a>: The voters will decide on November 5th if these questions are approved or denied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14455.236s">[Bears]</a>: The voters will decide next November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14457.489s">[Bears]</a>: serves on this council, who serves as the mayor, who serves as the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14461.191s">[Bears]</a>: And that's democracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14462.852s">[Bears]</a>: We aren't all going to agree with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14464.573s">[Bears]</a>: I've been on the losing end of quite a few votes in this room myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14468.115s">[Bears]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14599.435s">[Bears]</a>: I think the question is about why the property value is going up faster than the median or the average that the assessor presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14607.017s">[Bears]</a>: The assessor presented that just for this year, the estimated median single family tax bill would increase 195 year on year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14614.0s">[Bears]</a>: So that's, I'm just looking at the slide he presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14617.441s">[Bears]</a>: It was just for this change from fiscal 24 to fiscal 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14622.23s">[Bears]</a>: I think, quite frankly, a lot of those questions we'd have to talk to the assessor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14625.413s">[Bears]</a>: I'd be happy to try to set up a meeting with the three of us or the two of us if you don't want me involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14643.81s">[Bears]</a>: That surprises me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14686.314s">[Bears]</a>: I can't speak to what the state laws are around assessment and how they come up with their formulas, but I'd be happy to try to set up a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14693.3s">[Bears]</a>: I would love that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14694.181s">[Bears]</a>: We've gone extensively over on the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14696.003s">[Bears]</a>: I do want to give other Councilors a chance if any other Councilors want two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14730.831s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14731.372s">[Bears]</a>: I will coordinate, get the contact information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14733.734s">[Bears]</a>: We can try to set up a meeting around the specific questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14736.557s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14739.48s">[Bears]</a>: Just realizing I would have asked Larry to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14741.583s">[Bears]</a>: So another sad thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14745.567s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone else on this question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14747.729s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, we'll go to the podium to our former chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14750.693s">[Bears]</a>: One minute for one question, chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14982.807s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14983.608s">[Bears]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14984.268s">[Bears]</a>: You want to go if I can first chief, we didn't have an opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15344.016s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15417.751s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15418.331s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15419.451s">[Bears]</a>: I'll just speak for myself to say I appreciate your service to the city, coming down here tonight, laying out this case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15426.493s">[Bears]</a>: A lot of what you've talked about has been coming out drips and drabs over the past couple of months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15433.515s">[Bears]</a>: To me, to an extent, as best as I can say it, I think we are conflating two pieces of a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15442.079s">[Bears]</a>: There's the question of the design and the design process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15444.72s">[Bears]</a>: From everything I've heard, it's not adequate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15447.281s">[Bears]</a>: We're not at a final design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15448.301s">[Bears]</a>: The final design needs to be improved, 100%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15451.582s">[Bears]</a>: As I've read through letter from Danielle, things online, things like the clean zones and the space, and especially I know I've had some conversations with Todd Blake and the interim chief around how the design was changed relative to the MassDOT Mystic Ave Main Street project and how that's impacted things like turn radius and the apparatus bays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15472.048s">[Bears]</a>: I have a lot of significant concerns about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15474.509s">[Bears]</a>: I still believe a debt exclusion is the best way to fund the fire station headquarters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15478.93s">[Bears]</a>: Now, if 30 million is only funding 75, 85, 95% of that, A, it's not just 30 million, it's 30 million plus inflationary adjustments and minor project changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15491.053s">[Bears]</a>: So that 30 million bond could really be 32 to 35.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15493.293s">[Bears]</a>: If the changes can be made within that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15496.454s">[Bears]</a>: then this debt exclusion continues to pay for the fire station headquarters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15499.936s">[Bears]</a>: If it's more than that, you've said a number 40, 45 million, you think, potentially, I'm 100% in to say we need to look at the bond capacity or we need to ask again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15510.393s">[Bears]</a>: for more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15511.213s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think that voting no on this debt exclusion will get us to eventually a yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15516.515s">[Bears]</a>: That's my position on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15518.216s">[Bears]</a>: I think voting yes to the financing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15536.563s">[Bears]</a>: And I didn't mean to put words in your mouth that you're advocating for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15539.484s">[Bears]</a>: My personal position is voting yes funds most of this project, the way that I think it can best be funded, the fastest way it can be funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15547.745s">[Bears]</a>: I didn't have all this information when we released the plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15551.026s">[Bears]</a>: Do I wish that people had acted differently so it would be easier to talk to the residents and get them to support things like this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15560.748s">[Bears]</a>: As you're aware, as other folks here are aware, there are things that are not within<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15564.827s">[Bears]</a>: this council's control within my control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15571.658s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15609.125s">[Bears]</a>: I personally agree that the communication needs to be better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15611.407s">[Bears]</a>: It needs to be more of a seat at the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15613.668s">[Bears]</a>: I'm still going to vote the way I'm going to vote, because I think it gets us a lot of the way there on the financing question, even if I personally have a lot of problems and issues with the design and the design process as it stands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15622.234s">[Bears]</a>: So that's just where I'm at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15624.716s">[Bears]</a>: And I appreciate you coming down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15626.637s">[Bears]</a>: And yeah, I think the other thing we've talked about a lot tonight is that the state is not doing us right in a lot of ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15631.241s">[Bears]</a>: That includes MassDOT and DCR on our streets and roads in general.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15634.443s">[Bears]</a>: And you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15636.431s">[Bears]</a>: they get to say, well, we're not going to spend the 6 million to redesign your intersection if you don't do it our way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15640.973s">[Bears]</a>: And we don't really have a lot of recourse, even though I wish we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15644.695s">[Bears]</a>: So it's a tough situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15662.685s">[Bears]</a>: So if you've got a ramp that's 60,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15681.577s">[Bears]</a>: It sounds like a lot of heads need to get together before a final design happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15687.181s">[Bears]</a>: Anything else on this question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15688.662s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15690.304s">[Bears]</a>: I think we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15691.325s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15695.196s">[Bears]</a>: We have someone who hasn't asked a question yet, and then we have a hand that has and someone in line that has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15699.477s">[Bears]</a>: So we'll go to the floor, name and address for the record, one minute to answer one question or ask one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15708.98s">[Bears]</a>: It's on, you're good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15709.841s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15710.081s">[Bears]</a>: And you shouldn't need to touch it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15775.03s">[Bears]</a>: I can answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15775.631s">[Bears]</a>: Does anyone else want to go first on this question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15777.631s">[Bears]</a>: I know Councilor Scarpelli and I have been in five tax setting meetings together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15782.234s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know if you want to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15784.116s">[Bears]</a>: All right, residential exemption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15788.139s">[Bears]</a>: It's not the panacea, it seems to be A. There is a breakeven point in the home valuations, where if you implement a residential exemption, if your value is above that, you actually start paying more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15800.988s">[Bears]</a>: So if we implemented a residential exemption, I believe two years ago, that breakeven was almost exactly the average, around 768,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15809.315s">[Bears]</a>: If you're above that value, you actually start paying more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15812.901s">[Bears]</a>: than you did without the exemption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15814.362s">[Bears]</a>: If you're under that value, you pay less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15816.584s">[Bears]</a>: Now, the reason this happens is essentially to do this, A, the council would set it, but it would be in partnership with the assessor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15825.13s">[Bears]</a>: The assessor's office has said they probably need to hire two more full-time staff in that office just to process the applications every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15832.755s">[Bears]</a>: But essentially, you take what is the flat tax rate,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15837.89s">[Bears]</a>: across all residential, your 8.51 per thousand, I think is our FY 24 rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15843.672s">[Bears]</a>: And you create a 30% exemption on the tax of the average home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15850.414s">[Bears]</a>: So 30% of the tax bill for a $768,000 home, that becomes your exemption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15855.016s">[Bears]</a>: That's a fixed dollar amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15856.176s">[Bears]</a>: Let's say for just for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15858.709s">[Bears]</a>: efficiency sake, let's say that's $3,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15861.551s">[Bears]</a>: So if your tax bill is, uh, you know, $6,000, you get $3,000 off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15867.877s">[Bears]</a>: Um, but that has to be shifted, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15871.48s">[Bears]</a>: So the city's actual tax doesn't come down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15873.802s">[Bears]</a>: The city still needs to raise all the revenue it's raising every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15876.824s">[Bears]</a>: So that, that fixed dollar about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15879.514s">[Bears]</a>: actually also means that you increase the tax rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15882.238s">[Bears]</a>: So instead of having an 8.51% rate, you might have a 12.5% rate, but then you get the $3,000 off if you're owner occupied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15885.241s">[Bears]</a>: So if you're getting a 30% rate increase,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15895.609s">[Bears]</a>: and you're getting a 30% exemption, if you're in a lower value home, you save money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15899.411s">[Bears]</a>: If you're in a condo, you probably save money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15901.132s">[Bears]</a>: If you're in an under low value single family, you save money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15903.773s">[Bears]</a>: If you're in a multifamily, a high value single family, certainly if you're in a large apartment building, you're actually paying more because the tax rate's going up significantly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15913.345s">[Bears]</a>: to cover for that shift.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15915.826s">[Bears]</a>: So essentially, it benefits some people in the community, it benefits people who generally condo owners, people in single families below the breakeven point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15924.948s">[Bears]</a>: And it actually would result in increased taxes for people who have very high valued single family homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15931.65s">[Bears]</a>: Most multifamily homes are over 750,000 valuation apartment buildings are so we could implement it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15939.435s">[Bears]</a>: We would need six months to a year to do so before a tax rate hearing, which happens in December.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15944.258s">[Bears]</a>: So we'd probably need to make a decision by April or May of the prior year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15948.905s">[Bears]</a>: The assessor's office was ready to be budgeted to hire more staff to process the applications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15953.588s">[Bears]</a>: And at the end of the day, it doesn't, it's not a panacea for everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15957.991s">[Bears]</a>: I tend to support it anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15959.812s">[Bears]</a>: I think it turns a flat rate wealth tax into a progressive rate wealth tax, where the rate is actually lower on lower wealth properties and higher on higher wealth properties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15970.618s">[Bears]</a>: But it doesn't help everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15973.22s">[Bears]</a>: It doesn't mean, if you're a senior and you're above the break even, you might pay more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15977.141s">[Bears]</a>: So it's not, it doesn't help everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15980.482s">[Bears]</a>: It certainly is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15982.282s">[Bears]</a>: We consider it and discuss it every December.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15984.102s">[Bears]</a>: We basically have the conversation I just tried to summarize at our tax rate setting hearings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15990.663s">[Bears]</a>: And I know there's been different perspectives on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15992.244s">[Bears]</a>: I've been a supporter because I generally tend to think that having that progressive rate system is a better approach than the flat rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15998.985s">[Bears]</a>: But similarly, I've heard arguments from my colleagues, Councilor Caraviello, Councilor Knight, who are not on the council, but they were,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16005.56s">[Bears]</a>: concerned about what if you're in a home value above the breakeven point and that's about basically about half of people who are owning properties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16013.303s">[Bears]</a>: So I think it goes either way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16017.244s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16020.245s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16021.626s">[Bears]</a>: Any other stuff on the residential exemption?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16026.107s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16027.067s">[Bears]</a>: Can you wait?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16027.708s">[Bears]</a>: Can you wait?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16031.169s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16033.587s">[Bears]</a>: We are now, I think no one, has anyone who has, hold on one second, Andy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16037.752s">[Bears]</a>: I'll make a brief though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16038.733s">[Bears]</a>: Just one second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16040.075s">[Bears]</a>: Has anyone not asked a question who wants to ask a question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16045.06s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, we'll go to public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16046.922s">[Bears]</a>: I'll take Andy, then I'll take Gaston for a second question, then we have Micah on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16051.3s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Castagnetti.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16137.056s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Andy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16139.178s">[Bears]</a>: Gaston, either a question or a comment, and I'm gonna go up to two minutes for everybody for this last little section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16280.563s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Gaston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16282.364s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone else on that comment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16289.397s">[Bears]</a>: I just wanna note myself, and this is just me being an economics nerd, and I'm really sorry to do this at 10 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16295.96s">[Bears]</a>: I like to use the PCE price deflator for state and local government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16301.563s">[Bears]</a>: It's line 24 on the BEA table of the GDP price deflators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16306.446s">[Bears]</a>: And if you look at that, it tells a little bit of a different story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16308.767s">[Bears]</a>: Even when PCE for like the average person was 4%, for example, in 2021, for state and local government, it was 6.7.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16314.89s">[Bears]</a>: In 2021, it was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16319.694s">[Bears]</a>: 7.1, 2022 for PCE, generally it's 8.0 for state and local.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16324.136s">[Bears]</a>: State and local price inflators tend to be higher than the PCE.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16329.158s">[Bears]</a>: It's PCE, but it's just PCE broken down for state and local.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16331.979s">[Bears]</a>: It tends to be higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16333.88s">[Bears]</a>: I appreciate your comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16335.02s">[Bears]</a>: I agree that the new growth element is a factor here, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16338.182s">[Bears]</a>: And I think Matt was saying over the last, since 1980, I can't remember the fact, it's not 2.5% that we've averaged, it's 3.1 or something like that because of the new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16347.455s">[Bears]</a>: In the last couple of years, the new growth is significantly higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16349.796s">[Bears]</a>: So I think we're at like four, but we're also talking about 4% when we're looking at a cost increase of eight, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16357.198s">[Bears]</a>: So it's still running behind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16370.681s">[Bears]</a>: Someone put out a great chart where it was showing the real,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16374.765s">[Bears]</a>: a nominal dollar increase and then it also had a graph of the inflation adjusted real dollar increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16380.246s">[Bears]</a>: And I think personally we're catching up for 2020 to 2023 here with this override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16396.515s">[Bears]</a>: And to me, now we're going back and forth, and this is just because I- We're already gutting up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16400.236s">[Bears]</a>: I enjoy this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16400.956s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, I think this override catches us up to where we need to be, where the new growth, it fits to me what I'm seeing as this is the one time we're going to have to ask for this outside of the high school, because the new growth will get us there in five to 10 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16413.779s">[Bears]</a>: And this catches us up from the inflation adjustments that we need over the past few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16419.34s">[Bears]</a>: So, thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16423.1s">[Bears]</a>: I like arguing about PC with people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16426.38s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Zoom, and then we'll go to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16429.223s">[Bears]</a>: Zoom, I have Mike name and address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16431.425s">[Bears]</a>: Second question, you have two minutes if you want to ask a question and make a comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16657.548s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16659.63s">[Bears]</a>: Any further comments on that comment or question from members of the council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16662.954s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, we'll go to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16665.136s">[Bears]</a>: Our esteemed election commissioner and former school committee member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16808.046s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think we're going to go back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16809.027s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think we're going to go direct on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16856.74s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=375.785s">[Bears]</a>: He loved City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=377.006s">[Bears]</a>: He loved his job as city messenger, and he loved working with this council and his colleagues in the clerk's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=381.929s">[Bears]</a>: He was a calming and steady presence at council meetings, and he provided wise counsel to anyone who sought his advice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1188.949s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Kevin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1190.969s">[Bears]</a>: I have some words from former President Morell here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1195.171s">[Bears]</a>: She was hoping to be here, but I think in fitting for Larry, we had a long night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1201.472s">[Bears]</a>: She says, I want to send my deepest condolences to Larry's family, to thank them for sharing Larry with the city all these years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1207.947s">[Bears]</a>: who's an incredible steward of the city council and the chambers and was so dedicated to his role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1211.749s">[Bears]</a>: He'll be truly missed both as an individual and for all he brought to this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1218.574s">[Bears]</a>: And I get the difficult task of going last, but Larry once said to me, so long as you're not throwing chairs at each other, it's a good night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1231.482s">[Bears]</a>: Because I think he saw someone almost throw a chair at someone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1234.994s">[Bears]</a>: maybe this side to this side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1236.094s">[Bears]</a>: I think anyone who's only sat on this side has missed out sitting over here and seeing Larry's face and being able to make that eye contact with him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1248.1s">[Bears]</a>: And sitting up here too, it's been interesting the first few months of this term, but I didn't get to know Larry as well as I wanted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1253.482s">[Bears]</a>: I've known him for five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1254.683s">[Bears]</a>: The first few years were the pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1257.564s">[Bears]</a>: We were on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1259.165s">[Bears]</a>: Larry's still coming to my house every day, every Friday, bringing the papers and whatnot, but didn't get<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1265.123s">[Bears]</a>: uh, really to get to know him until we were back here and we were able to talk more before and after meetings during expected and unexpected recesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1274.889s">[Bears]</a>: Um, but I always like to think of it kind of how Councilor Scarpelli did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1279.272s">[Bears]</a>: If you were hearing words of encouragement from Larry, he didn't have a great day, but he, he presented it in a nice way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1285.916s">[Bears]</a>: If you're having words of respect from Larry, you had a decent day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1290.018s">[Bears]</a>: He did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1290.298s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1291.039s">[Bears]</a>: And if you had words of pride from Larry, you had a really good day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1293.977s">[Bears]</a>: And I was lucky enough to experience all three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1297.28s">[Bears]</a>: I probably have a warped sense in my mind that may be more pride than encouragement, but it was really just helpful to be able to talk to Larry about just have all that knowledge, decades of knowledge of this body and these meetings, to talk to someone with a different perspective on a lot of issues, but then find a lot of common ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1322.319s">[Bears]</a>: And I know that he will be missed by this body, by the former members, by a lot of people in City Hall and certainly by his family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1330.041s">[Bears]</a>: He was just a really wonderful, kind, caring person who I really enjoyed spending time with in the limited ways that I was able to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1339.784s">[Bears]</a>: And I know there are a lot of people who got to enjoy a lot more time with Larry who aren't going to be able to share that time with him anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1346.466s">[Bears]</a>: So I'm thinking of them because if I feel this way, I can only imagine how they feel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2687.81s">[Bears]</a>: Could you state what the position of the engineering department is relative to the amendment request?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2718.837s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2723.098s">[Bears]</a>: Given the potential, I'll just leave it at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2728.36s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, it is what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2730.04s">[Bears]</a>: We have a motion on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2827.9s">[Bears]</a>: Council, let me move to refer the paper with items to the next regular council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2832.205s">[Bears]</a>: That was at our October 2nd, I believe, Committee of the Whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2835.588s">[Bears]</a>: Paper is from the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2838.066s">[Bears]</a>: Dear President Bears, members of the City Council, I respect the request and recommend that your Honorable Body approves the following appropriations from the Capital Stabilization Fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2845.13s">[Bears]</a>: Replacement of the water heater at the Brooks Elementary School in the amount of $267,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2873.753s">[Bears]</a>: $5,000 as your honorable body knows the capital stabilization fund currently has a balance of 400.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2877.835s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I'm just gonna, it's more like two sentences out has a balance of $4,538,465 given the appropriations made September 17, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2888.792s">[Bears]</a>: If all the above are approved, the capital stabilization fund would have $3,923,737.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2891.393s">[Bears]</a>: That remains any appropriation from any stabilization account required the two thirds majority vote of the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2934.266s">[Bears]</a>: So two years ago, a little past that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2939.127s">[Bears]</a>: We had a little bit of a disagreement, I would say, the mayor and I, over the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2945.77s">[Bears]</a>: And, you know, and I think it's important to sort of like, just be straight up, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2950.251s">[Bears]</a>: Council had some serious questions about the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2953.172s">[Bears]</a>: We wanted to talk about an improved budget process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2955.373s">[Bears]</a>: We wanted to talk about the underfunding issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2957.254s">[Bears]</a>: Council Vice President Collins and I were, had identified the need, the significant underfunding and the excuse of what type of funds to fund operating expenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2967.698s">[Bears]</a>: And that budget went to the last, I think, 2 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2972.023s">[Bears]</a>: meeting, the Mayor came out, and at the end of it, we made some improvements to the budget, and we talked about what we'd do the following year, and that budget actually passed, I think, unanimously, or at least the Councilor and I next to me voted for it at the end of the night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2987.81s">[Bears]</a>: The next year we came back and we took a bit of a different approach, really focusing on what would a better budget process for the city look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2995.755s">[Bears]</a>: And what ended up happening, the council collectively again unanimously put forward a set of budget requests, budget demands in a sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3007.262s">[Bears]</a>: President Morell at the time, Nicole Morell and I went and met with the mayor and we sat down and we said, here's what the council wants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3012.386s">[Bears]</a>: We want a better budget process, we want more funding for our schools, we want more funding for our library.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3017.691s">[Bears]</a>: And what we were able to negotiate on behalf of the council as council leadership with the mayor was three things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3024.156s">[Bears]</a>: The formation of a financial task force,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3026.431s">[Bears]</a>: consisting of the leadership of the school committee, the city council, and the mayor, the commitment to establish a new budget process through a budget ordinance, which we passed this year and used in this year's budget, starting the process earlier than ever in the most transparent way possible, and the commitment to really address this issue of underfunding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3045.023s">[Bears]</a>: And that's what the financial task force did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3047.764s">[Bears]</a>: We've released, again, multiple press releases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3050.006s">[Bears]</a>: We announced it at the budget time last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3052.067s">[Bears]</a>: We announced the formation of the task force, and then we announced<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3453.725s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3459.911s">[Bears]</a>: And I think the Mayor can speak to it too, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3461.992s">[Bears]</a>: Just to get to this budget, we basically didn't do $3 million worth of looking at the Mayor for it, because she did approximately $3 million worth of stuff that we wanted to start doing this year about that on the city side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3474.818s">[Bears]</a>: So, when you talk about having enough people to make sure that city government is performing its basic services,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3483.746s">[Bears]</a>: just another impact if it doesn't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3485.387s">[Bears]</a>: You know, we're talking, I think you guys mentioned it before, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3488.51s">[Bears]</a>: Not only would we likely have to cut many of the things that are funded by one-time funds, but there certainly would not be an opportunity for the city to add a staff member in a key office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3498.137s">[Bears]</a>: That's where it's currently needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3499.799s">[Bears]</a>: The other thing I just want to say, going quickly back to the grant side of things, grants are 99% of the time one-time or short-term funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3507.505s">[Bears]</a>: Whether it's one year, two years, or three years, eventually the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3512.517s">[Bears]</a>: It's not a sustainable way to fund a permanent operating budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3515.598s">[Bears]</a>: The reason we're talking about an override and talking about property taxes is because it is a permanent revenue source to fund ongoing expenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3525.421s">[Bears]</a>: And the great sad impact of Proposition 2.5 was that sustainable revenue went away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3531.964s">[Bears]</a>: You know, DPW 40 years ago had twice as many people working here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3537.043s">[Bears]</a>: Now we're talking about just having people to work there to fill potholes, because we don't even have that anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3542.664s">[Bears]</a>: And I think that's a legacy both of the Proposition 2.5 law and 45 years of not being willing to say to the voters, yeah, this is hard, but we need to ask us to come together and fund these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3555.608s">[Bears]</a>: Otherwise, they're not going to get done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3557.428s">[Bears]</a>: And as Dana mentioned, then it just snowballs and gets worse and worse and worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3992.25s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks, and I just want to make kind of two points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3995.211s">[Bears]</a>: I think what the mayor said about there are things that are not set in stone and need to be tweaked, I think that's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4000.192s">[Bears]</a>: I think we've heard from some folks that there are tweaks that they would like to see made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4006.213s">[Bears]</a>: I think this question of the clean zones and the phasing for folks, firefighters coming back from a firefighter, from a fire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4015.775s">[Bears]</a>: Some questions around showers and bunk space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4018.195s">[Bears]</a>: But there's two things here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4019.838s">[Bears]</a>: Voting yes on question six is about voting yes on a five and six mechanism, not a final design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4025.046s">[Bears]</a>: The State Department of Revenue has very clear guidelines that say minor project changes, inflationary adjustments due to construction and timing can adjust the size of the bond slightly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4035.788s">[Bears]</a>: It's not gonna jump from a $30 million bond to a $40 million bond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4039.209s">[Bears]</a>: It's not gonna happen, but it might be from 30 to 31 or 32 if there are minor project changes that need to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4046.43s">[Bears]</a>: So my hope is, as the mayor noted, there's a concept design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4050.151s">[Bears]</a>: It's not a final design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4051.735s">[Bears]</a>: There's been statements at the Council Q&A last week from firefighters around things that they would like to see different, and I think we can vote yes on the financing mechanism, and my hope would be that as the design moves from a concept design to a final design, those project changes can happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4211.264s">[Bears]</a>: The mayor mentioned earlier the exemptions available through the assessor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4217.298s">[Bears]</a>: They are the maximum exemptions allowed by state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4220.719s">[Bears]</a>: Only state representatives and state senators can increase them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4224.38s">[Bears]</a>: The council and the mayor's office have been really intentional about maximizing, making sure that we're doing the most that the state allows us to do, and then tying our own exemptions to the state law so that if it ever goes up, Medford's go up automatically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4238.185s">[Bears]</a>: There's been some talk that seniors could be exempted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4241.527s">[Bears]</a>: There's nothing in the Proposition 2 1⁄2 law that allows that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4244.349s">[Bears]</a>: It just doesn't exist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4246.27s">[Bears]</a>: It's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4248.051s">[Bears]</a>: So it's a difficult situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4251.052s">[Bears]</a>: We are doing, as a city, the most that the state law allows us to do to try to protect all the people that the state law allows us to protect through exemptions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4260.057s">[Bears]</a>: We have the deferral program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4261.698s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, there's 5% interest on the deferral program, but again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4266.961s">[Bears]</a>: that is what the state law allows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4268.803s">[Bears]</a>: I think we maybe could reduce that to as low as 2%, something we could look at 4%, so we're at 5 and you go down to 4, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4277.449s">[Bears]</a>: We could look at that, but we'd still have to talk to assessing, you know, and what would the impact of that be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4282.193s">[Bears]</a>: There's the work-off program, but again, I think Anna's point<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4288.274s">[Bears]</a>: is incredibly restrictive about what it allows municipalities to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4291.917s">[Bears]</a>: I wish we had a very different local tax system that could much more target and direct the impact and who's paying what taxes, but we have a flat property tax with limited exemptions, and that's what the state wants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4935.443s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I think just to add to what Jenny said, you can also just not make decisions, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4941.186s">[Bears]</a>: And I think that's the other thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4942.767s">[Bears]</a>: Camps have been kicked out of the road for decades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4945.769s">[Bears]</a>: Some good things have happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4946.99s">[Bears]</a>: There have been projects that have founded the norm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4951.432s">[Bears]</a>: I think the new schools project is one of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4954.614s">[Bears]</a>: But most basic maintenance, basic staffing, fixing 100<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4966.65s">[Bears]</a>: Having enough staff to do the basic job of what a city needs to do has basically just not happened, and now that has created a massive debt that is coming due.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4978.539s">[Bears]</a>: It is a difficult inflection point, and it sounds like the library is closing soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4984.544s">[Bears]</a>: But there's another thing right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4986.245s">[Bears]</a>: Our library is not open on Sundays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4987.546s">[Bears]</a>: Most libraries are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4988.807s">[Bears]</a>: Our library closes early on Saturdays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4993.493s">[Bears]</a>: You can find every department, every single thing that the city does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4997.654s">[Bears]</a>: It's generally a little less than most other places because we don't have the funds to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=928.8s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President, Madam Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=933.462s">[Bears]</a>: Again, I think we need to talk about what the process actually was in the RFP, which discussed us having specific public meetings around specific proposals for specific neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=945.248s">[Bears]</a>: This is a public meeting on the Mystic App proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=950.45s">[Bears]</a>: We can talk about the process that got us here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=953.191s">[Bears]</a>: Again, robust, extensive, comprehensive planning over two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=957.017s">[Bears]</a>: feedback from thousands of residents, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=960.74s">[Bears]</a>: When you read the RFP, when you read the contract that was awarded, we talked about holding public process and public meetings throughout on specific proposals for specific areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=971.489s">[Bears]</a>: We've had multiple meetings to generate this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=973.931s">[Bears]</a>: We're now having a meeting on the final draft proposal coming out of committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=978.374s">[Bears]</a>: It goes to council for automatic referral to Community Development Board, where there'll be another public hearing on this proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=987.0s">[Bears]</a>: a community meeting, whatever we want to call it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=991.204s">[Bears]</a>: There's public meetings ahead on this proposal specific to Mystic Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=996.669s">[Bears]</a>: And that's the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=998.03s">[Bears]</a>: So we are having the public meetings and engaging the residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1002.629s">[Bears]</a>: on these proposals based on the two plus years of public engagement and community engagement that's already happened to develop the city comprehensive plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1011.894s">[Bears]</a>: We're now executing on literally years of community process and engagement around this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1017.657s">[Bears]</a>: We've heard from residents around Mystic Avenue multiple times on proposals and on the ideas of what was in the comprehensive plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1026.202s">[Bears]</a>: And now we have a draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1027.963s">[Bears]</a>: This public meeting is occurring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1029.824s">[Bears]</a>: There will be the meeting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1031.792s">[Bears]</a>: to refer this to the Community Development Board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1033.593s">[Bears]</a>: The Community Development Board will have a public hearing and at every step along the way, community members will be engaged and are being engaged in that process and will have continued voice even beyond the voice that's already been part of this process to inform this plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1048.925s">[Bears]</a>: So I don't know specifically what the request is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1054.309s">[Bears]</a>: If it is to have a public meeting,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1060.509s">[Bears]</a>: That's happening and has happened and will continue to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2002.948s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2004.289s">[Bears]</a>: I was just wondering,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2006.688s">[Bears]</a>: Paula, in the memo, you noted that we need a little more study on like what the community solar incentive would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2014.715s">[Bears]</a>: Are we thinking that that would be something that the research could be done like, well, this is being also at the public meetings for the Community Development Board and could maybe be included as a recommendation from the CD board or at the final council hearing on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2031.55s">[Bears]</a>: Or do we need more time than that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2152.716s">[Bears]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2153.016s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2462.403s">[Bears]</a>: about how we communicate this process, and I mean this for all stakeholders here and those who have been part of this so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2473.814s">[Bears]</a>: We are doing a comprehensive update to the zoning ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2477.497s">[Bears]</a>: We're breaking that into pieces, as was discussed in the RFP, as was discussed in our first 13 meeting of this committee on this topic so far, because we want<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2489.133s">[Bears]</a>: the public to be able to access the different pieces of the project as we move along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2494.035s">[Bears]</a>: But instead of saying, I mean, we could have met, you know, 25, 30, 40 times, and then had a document at the end of it, you know, and had a 200 page document that here's the new zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2504.619s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think anyone would have really been able to understand that in the way that this process is working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2510.141s">[Bears]</a>: So that's why I think we just need to be really clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2512.182s">[Bears]</a>: And I think we need to tighten up a little bit how we're communicating this out, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2520.35s">[Bears]</a>: each of these stages as part of this comprehensive zoning update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2524.072s">[Bears]</a>: Right now we're working on the Mystic Avenue Corridor District.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2528.155s">[Bears]</a>: That is the district boundaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2531.497s">[Bears]</a>: What uses do we want in that area?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2533.358s">[Bears]</a>: How does that align with the comprehensive plan and all the public participation up to this point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2538.061s">[Bears]</a>: The goal of this committee, and I think we need to maybe really put out a very specific calendar and probably work through this together in our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2550.247s">[Bears]</a>: meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2550.407s">[Bears]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2550.487s">[Bears]</a>: Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2550.727s">[Bears]</a>: You know, our steering meetings here of the goal was to have essentially two meetings a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2558.051s">[Bears]</a>: Where one meeting was discussing districts and one meeting was discussing global changes like what director Hunt said around parking, and I think we need to put out a calendar going forward that says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2569.756s">[Bears]</a>: Here's the district that we're working on this month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2576.55s">[Bears]</a>: here's the global change that we're working on this month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2578.791s">[Bears]</a>: Here's the date and the time of that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2580.931s">[Bears]</a>: And, you know, the, and just really like lock that in and lock that down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2585.992s">[Bears]</a>: I understand we need to have some flexibility as questions come up, but, um, I think putting that out is going to just behoove all of us to a, keep us on track, keep us on plan, but also to make sure that, um, folks feel communicated to about this and,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2606.235s">[Bears]</a>: So I just really think we should probably sit down in our next meeting and say, OK, November, we're finishing up the Salem Street corridor district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2616.701s">[Bears]</a>: That's what we've already talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2618.441s">[Bears]</a>: We're looking at this set of global plans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2620.803s">[Bears]</a>: I think we're doing that in memos.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2622.083s">[Bears]</a>: And I think like those of us who are maybe like in this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2625.774s">[Bears]</a>: and especially those who are in the steering part of the process understand what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2629.737s">[Bears]</a>: I just don't think we're like putting that out in a communications way really effectively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2634.039s">[Bears]</a>: So I just wanna think about how we can do that where we move forward from here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2642.965s">[Bears]</a>: And also, I just wanna note, like, I appreciate that we can, you know, look at further studies and look at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2652.958s">[Bears]</a>: finding more grants for more studies and things like that, and I think that that's useful in some cases, but I think the goal of this process as outlined in the RFP is to do the comprehensive rezoning of the entire zoning ordinance and to rezone the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2666.944s">[Bears]</a>: And if there are studies that need to go longer than that, then I think we should think about that in the way that Director Hunt and Vice President Collins were just talking about, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2679.11s">[Bears]</a>: We can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2680.111s">[Bears]</a>: implement this change now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2682.412s">[Bears]</a>: And if there's a study where we're not going to get the grant funding for a year, we can come back and further fine tune that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2688.055s">[Bears]</a>: But I just want to make sure that we keep moving along this plan so that at the end of this process, we have that comprehensive zoning update that matches the goals and action items from the comprehensive plan<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2703.262s">[Bears]</a>: And then that's the thing that can then be further updated, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2706.524s">[Bears]</a>: I think that's the base document for the city planning for the next 20 to 30 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2712.086s">[Bears]</a>: And then we'll have those additional studies and long-term pieces of things that will further inform tweaks and changes down the road as market conditions change or new industries pop up or whatever it may be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2725.451s">[Bears]</a>: But I just think there's like a little bit of communications work<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2729.15s">[Bears]</a>: that we can be doing that would go a long way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2731.112s">[Bears]</a>: And so I hope that we can work on that going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2818.814s">[Bears]</a>: And even more so, I think it's actually less granular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2820.955s">[Bears]</a>: I think we've done that, but it's like a slide in a presentation or a paragraph or a section in a memo<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2827.922s">[Bears]</a>: And I think, you know, I'm just thinking of like how people access information and, you know, if someone doesn't open the memo or watch the meeting or see the presentation, it's really more of a presentation question to me than anything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2840.566s">[Bears]</a>: Like, how do we take that information that we've already kind of discussed and put out a little more formally and turn what is a slide in a presentation into a flyer, something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3051.417s">[Bears]</a>: took us on a bit of a tangent there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3053.038s">[Bears]</a>: I appreciate everybody going through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3055.759s">[Bears]</a>: I did have one question going back to the development standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3063.142s">[Bears]</a>: I know that we're hoping, or the plan is that at the end, there's kind of a realignment of the development standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3071.165s">[Bears]</a>: And that probably coincides with the catching of like the artifacts and other quirks that end up<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3082.492s">[Bears]</a>: happening because of the way that we're doing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3086.354s">[Bears]</a>: Would the intent of that be that there would be like a development standard section that's outside of the corridor specific sections and what basically would there then just be like a development standard section and then it would have the corridor separate breakdowns within them or just could we go a little bit more into that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3109.848s">[Bears]</a>: Just want to clarify that for myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3179.974s">[Bears]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3180.295s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3180.695s">[Bears]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4285.472s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I just wanted to say thanks, Martha, and I wanted to know what you just noted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4290.873s">[Bears]</a>: Chair Collins, which is that, you know, the most recent, I mean, I think there's a few language changes that aren't yet up on the Civic Clerk website, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4300.778s">[Bears]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4300.898s">[Bears]</a>: Draft as a Friday on the map as a Friday are up at, um, our council agenda portal and attached his files there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4308.882s">[Bears]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4310.783s">[Bears]</a>: And appreciate the comment about flexibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4314.065s">[Bears]</a>: Um, it looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4316.366s">[Bears]</a>: The C two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4318.027s">[Bears]</a>: The zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4320.748s">[Bears]</a>: I think it actually a but a commercial and an auto<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4328.914s">[Bears]</a>: In Somerville, and then about so residential, but I think it's worth certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4333.476s">[Bears]</a>: As this moves through the planning board, if they want to take a look at that, the community development board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4337.517s">[Bears]</a>: Um, if there's something we could do there, but that math inspection site, and then the used auto shop immediately to it's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4346.08s">[Bears]</a>: East those are actually in Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4349.341s">[Bears]</a>: Um, and it looks like there's, I can't quite read the summerville map right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4353.783s">[Bears]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4355.362s">[Bears]</a>: or I can't quite tell exactly what they put there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4357.203s">[Bears]</a>: It looks like it might be a mid-rise three district, because I have seen those very narrow, very thin housing units, which I've always been interested in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4365.847s">[Bears]</a>: It seems like a great way to use an interesting lot for affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4371.05s">[Bears]</a>: But there are actually auto uses on the Somerville side as well, abutting that C2 on Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4466.374s">[Bears]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4467.094s">[Bears]</a>: I also have a minor amendment<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4477.359s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, just a slight language amendment to move to refer the draft Mystic Avenue zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4485.022s">[Bears]</a>: Quarter district proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4487.363s">[Bears]</a>: To the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4489.524s">[Bears]</a>: Next regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4491.225s">[Bears]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4492.145s">[Bears]</a>: So just be clear that it's the missing Avenue<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4518.722s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4519.323s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4538.78s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1074.317s">[Bears]</a>: 24480, offered by President Bears, resolution to thank two DPW staff members for an act of kindness and their dedicated service to Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1083.106s">[Bears]</a>: Whereas on Saturday, October 5th, quick thinking by DPW employees, Jeff Gangy and Anthony Pompeo helped return a lost wallet to Robert Bohannon, an 82 year old disabled veteran.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1093.091s">[Bears]</a>: And whereas Mr. Bohannon was deeply thankful to have the wallet returned, both because it was designed by his late brother and because the cards and information would have taken months to replace, describing the act, quote, as quote, as close to a miracle as we have experienced and,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1106.857s">[Bears]</a>: Whereas Mr. Bohannon and his wife wanted to express their gratitude and, quote, do something for these really thoughtful employees while noting that, quote, they wouldn't take anything and including his letter with the words, quote, we love Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1117.506s">[Bears]</a>: Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we thank Jeff Genge and Anthony Pompeo from our DPW for their dedicated service to the city of Medford and honor their active service and kindness that was described as Mr. Bohannon as, quote, the best of many great moments I've experienced in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1134.875s">[Bears]</a>: For me, we just got a really, really kind email and I felt like it was worth saying thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1139.32s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone want to say anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1140.081s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1199.396s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Clerk, you don't have to call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1201.337s">[Bears]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1207.068s">[Bears]</a>: reports of committees 24475 offered by council President Bears committee of the whole October 15 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1214.93s">[Bears]</a>: This was the question and answer session that we held October 15 regarding the proposed override and debt exclusion ballot questions that are on the ballot on November 5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1227.092s">[Bears]</a>: And just a point of note, as regards to the voting Councilor Scarpelli raised to me the point of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1232.566s">[Bears]</a>: the letting people know if you're coming in, we're seeing a lot of early voting, a lot of mail voting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1237.528s">[Bears]</a>: And just a reminder to everyone, when you early vote or you mail vote, your ballot is put into a sealed envelope and that envelope is opened on election day and counted on election day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1247.892s">[Bears]</a>: So if you're expecting it to run through the machine on the early voter, the mail vote, that's not how the state law around elections work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1255.57s">[Bears]</a>: So those envelopes will be opened by the elections department staff on election day and then will be run through the machines on election day, along with all the ballots of everyone who votes on election day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1789.489s">[Bears]</a>: The pop-up area was created from what was a previously redundant drive aisle and six parking spots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1795.715s">[Bears]</a>: To prevent any loss of parking, eight new parking spots were re-striped in the parking lot, resulting in a net positive for parking spaces overall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1855.933s">[Bears]</a>: Please note that parking for our seniors is a top priority for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1859.675s">[Bears]</a>: The mayor explicitly mentioned this in her greeting to developers before the walkthrough last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1866.451s">[Bears]</a>: Construction employee parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1868.174s">[Bears]</a>: Due to the large-scale construction project at 121 Riverside Avenue, the adjacent Clippership lot has seen an influx of commercial and personal vehicle parking to accommodate workers and staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1878.757s">[Bears]</a>: As a result of this temporary parking situation, the mayor contacted Medford Housing Authority Director Jeffrey Driscoll to get a more complete breakdown of what vehicles are occupying spaces during the day, how long this disruption is anticipated and how a compromise can be reached to alleviate community concerns and allow accessibility to the worksite.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1897.464s">[Bears]</a>: The mayor concluded that there were up to an additional 40 cars due to the lot construction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1902.285s">[Bears]</a>: Director Driscoll has been receptive and helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1904.386s">[Bears]</a>: He reached out to the contractor for support<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1907.04s">[Bears]</a>: Jim Silva, Special Project Coordinator, also visited the lot earlier last week and requested that the workers use the lower City Hall lot instead so that seniors had spots when visiting the Senior Center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1917.272s">[Bears]</a>: It is a work in progress to get the construction workers to relocate, but we are doing everything possible as parking for our seniors is our priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1923.939s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1926.922s">[Bears]</a>: And I'll recognize Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2166.323s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2167.387s">[Bears]</a>: Any further comments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2169.233s">[Bears]</a>: Council Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2234.44s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2235.4s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2316.202s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2359.915s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2360.335s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2360.655s">[Bears]</a>: And just procedurally, um, the next steps as far as I understand it, the memo mentioned that responses will be due December 20th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2369.618s">[Bears]</a>: I believe then the planning department would come to this body to request our approval to authorize a land lease.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2375.68s">[Bears]</a>: So there would be further public meetings regarding the proposal, and it would require a vote of the council to authorize the city to lease the land.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2383.917s">[Bears]</a>: No, I'm just saying that that's the next steps for the RFP, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2388.759s">[Bears]</a>: But we will go to comments and everyone will have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2392.181s">[Bears]</a>: Give me one second as I figure out our new microphone system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2399.724s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2449.281s">[Bears]</a>: name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2450.322s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2597.416s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2599.117s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2792.383s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2792.843s">[Bears]</a>: I can speak to the process that the planning department is working on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2797.986s">[Bears]</a>: I spoke with the planning director, Alicia Hunt, and she was at the Chamber of Commerce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2804.01s">[Bears]</a>: I think last week they had a day where all the businesses in the square could meet with her and kind of have conversations about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2811.294s">[Bears]</a>: That includes the current chair is the Chevalier manager, Andrew Mather, and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2819.539s">[Bears]</a>: So that was something that happened, and I know that she relayed to me that there was a lot of excitement, but they did want to be engaged specifically around this question of parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2827.602s">[Bears]</a>: And one of the things that they were looking at, and I don't know if it's going to happen as part of this project, and it really depends on the proposals that come in from the people who are proposing, was seeing if the parking garage that is attached to Atrius Health could be redeveloped to be a more public parking garage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2847.548s">[Bears]</a>: so that during the day it could be used by the health folks and at night potentially be used for other uses, because right now it's closed at night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2856.712s">[Bears]</a>: But I don't think that would be the only answer, but that was just an idea that I had heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2861.895s">[Bears]</a>: In any case, there was a meeting with the Chamber of Commerce specifically about these RFPs with the businesses in the square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2868.898s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2874.909s">[Bears]</a>: Does anyone else want to speak on the topic Councilor Tseng, Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2982.91s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2984.19s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion on this public participation petition?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2988.892s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3012.845s">[Bears]</a>: I need your name and address for the record to start off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3017.168s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3104.148s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3104.549s">[Bears]</a>: Go to Councilor Callahan, then we'll go back to the microphone for public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3462.992s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3463.392s">[Bears]</a>: I do want to just make a point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3465.094s">[Bears]</a>: I don't disagree with what you said and engaging people is really important, but I just want to be clear that going to the RFP was not the first thing as part of this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3474.743s">[Bears]</a>: This process references the 2017 Medford Square plan under Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3479.988s">[Bears]</a>: There was a 2019 evaluation of development potential under Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3483.671s">[Bears]</a>: the 2022 housing plan and the 2022 draft comprehensive plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3487.232s">[Bears]</a>: And there were multiple community meetings last year before the drafting of this RFP, including two at the senior center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3494.214s">[Bears]</a>: So, you know, that work has happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3496.475s">[Bears]</a>: Maybe not everyone went to every meeting, but when we talk about what happened, I just think that should be noted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3503.397s">[Bears]</a>: There was two public meetings at the senior center talking about this project and the transforming the square initiative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3564.569s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3565.07s">[Bears]</a>: And I certainly don't disagree with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3567.151s">[Bears]</a>: I do know that the office worked with the senior center to get the word out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3571.522s">[Bears]</a>: And I am hopeful, again, we heard from Dan Kennedy recently online about a city newspaper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3577.027s">[Bears]</a>: We need that level of information and resource, but there have been meetings and we do do as much outreach as we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3585.414s">[Bears]</a>: And that doesn't always reach everyone, even when we try to reach everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3588.437s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3672.987s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3673.667s">[Bears]</a>: I'll go to the podium, name and address for the record, and you'll have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3705.901s">[Bears]</a>: In terms of the Colleen's behind there, that's not part of the scope of the request for proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3763.459s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address the record, you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3850.669s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, so we don't have the proposals yet, but the request for proposals document says that parking is a priority and that the senior center parking needs to be replaced in full no matter what develops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3862.474s">[Bears]</a>: But the specific proposals such as height, et cetera, hasn't come out yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3866.276s">[Bears]</a>: And that won't be out until after December 20th, which is the deadline for the proposals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3942.484s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3944.387s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion on this subject Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4056.088s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I would just note.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4058.681s">[Bears]</a>: that we did receive that they were well attended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4061.502s">[Bears]</a>: We could probably get more information about that to share with folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4065.664s">[Bears]</a>: And I believe there are recordings available online as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4069.006s">[Bears]</a>: But it does tend to be as part of the planning process that you spend a the time to do the comprehensive plan, then you spend the time to do the community outreach, and then you put together the proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4077.71s">[Bears]</a>: And then again, right, like, that's not the end of the public process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4081.391s">[Bears]</a>: So it's a multi year multi stage planning process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4083.892s">[Bears]</a>: But<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4085.973s">[Bears]</a>: We're having a conversation right now, and people can come to any council meeting and talk about it, but we also will have further public meetings and public hearings as the process goes forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4150.94s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion on this item?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4157.472s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, we'll move to general public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4159.553s">[Bears]</a>: Public participation on any topic not on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4165.495s">[Bears]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4182.783s">[Bears]</a>: I saw him just the other day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4288.273s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion or anyone who'd like to participate in public participation on any item that's not on the agenda for the rest of the evening?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4299.881s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, is there a motion on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4303.965s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4308.789s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion of Vice President Collins to revert to the regular order of business, seconded by Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4313.033s">[Bears]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4314.614s">[Bears]</a>: Opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4315.235s">[Bears]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4318.554s">[Bears]</a>: 24484, resolution to adopt local options of HERO Act, whereas Governor Healey recently signed into law an act honoring, empowering, and recognizing our service members and veterans, also known as the HERO Act, Chapter 178 of the Acts of 2024, to increase benefits, modernize services, and promote inclusivity for veterans in Massachusetts, and whereas the HERO Act allows local option in which cities may tie property tax exemptions and veteran-specific exemptions to the Consumer Price Index<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4347.436s">[Bears]</a>: allowing for automatic year-to-year increases in these exemptions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4350.679s">[Bears]</a>: Now therefore be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the City of Medford accept General Law, Chapter 59, Section 5, Clause 22i, which authorizes an annual increase in the amount of the exemption granted under General Law, Chapter 59, Section 5, Clause 22, 22a, 22b, 22c, 22e, and 22f,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4370.317s">[Bears]</a>: by the percentage increase in the U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4371.798s">[Bears]</a>: Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index for the previous year as determined by the Department of Revenue to be effective for the applicable exemptions granted for any fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2025, and be it further resolved that the City of Medford accept the General Laws Chapter 59, Section 5, Clause 22J, which authorizes an annual increase in the amount of the exemption granted under General Laws Chapter 59, Section 5, Clauses 22,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4400.237s">[Bears]</a>: 22A, 22B, 22C, 22E, and 22F by up to 100% of the personal exemption amount subject to the conditions in Clause 22J to be effective for applicable exemptions granted for any fiscal year beginning on or after July 1st, 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4414.69s">[Bears]</a>: And we do have attached here the memo from the Division of Local Services of the State Department of Revenue regarding the HERO Act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4425.147s">[Bears]</a>: and I believe Councilor Leming has also discussed this with the assessor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4429.289s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4540.403s">[Bears]</a>: That was what he on the motion of Councilor Leming to refer this paper for legal review seconded by Councilor Kelly and is there any further discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4589.42s">[Bears]</a>: Go to Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4646.79s">[Bears]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4648.351s">[Bears]</a>: I'll go back to Councilor Leming in just a second, but I was on some of the email chains and we can get that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4653.752s">[Bears]</a>: Ted has already said he doesn't expect it to be a significant impact on the overlay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4658.353s">[Bears]</a>: And yeah, but I'll go to Councilor Leming, he had more of the conversations than I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4689.462s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you Councilor Megan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4691.103s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, I would note DLS literally gave us sample language here and that's the language we're using.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4697.968s">[Bears]</a>: I personally don't think this needs to go to KP for however long they're going to take on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4708.836s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4710.497s">[Bears]</a>: It's really written, but if we want to just get a letter from the assessor and then we can take it up in two weeks or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4715.861s">[Bears]</a>: And if KP can get us something in two weeks,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4719.892s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4721.553s">[Bears]</a>: So I think that would mean that would be a motion to table till the next regular meeting and request a memo from the assessor and legal if they can provide one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4737.919s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4739.02s">[Bears]</a>: On that motion by Councilor Leming, seconded by Councilor Tseng, all those in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4745.823s">[Bears]</a>: All those opposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4747.398s">[Bears]</a>: Motion passes and this is tabled to the next regular meeting pending those requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4754.043s">[Bears]</a>: And Councilor Leming if you could just ping Ted, and maybe Nina for KP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4763.731s">[Bears]</a>: And the clerk can coordinate with you on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4765.292s">[Bears]</a>: 24489 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5193.967s">[Bears]</a>: Is this an amendment to the resolution to request?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5197.729s">[Bears]</a>: It says here right now, consultants attend the next city council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5201.151s">[Bears]</a>: Do we want to change that to a future council meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5252.921s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion by members of the council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5290.029s">[Bears]</a>: Opposed motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5335.26s">[Bears]</a>: And I will go to Vice President Collins in just a second but just to say, this has been discussed I think we've had 13 committee meetings on the zoning updates project and the planning and permitting committee meet in planning and permitting committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5347.388s">[Bears]</a>: This was referred out last week, procedurally the next steps are that we would now refer to the Community Development Board, they will hold a public hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5356.533s">[Bears]</a>: then they will refer it back with amendments or without to the City Council where the City Council will hold a public hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5364.078s">[Bears]</a>: And at that public hearing, the City Council would vote to adopt finally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5368.14s">[Bears]</a>: So there are two more public hearings on this proposal and I will go to Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5600.501s">[Bears]</a>: on the motion to refer to community development by Vice President Collins seconded by Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5605.287s">[Bears]</a>: We'll have further discussion I'll go to Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5897.932s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5898.573s">[Bears]</a>: I just want to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5900.074s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think any proposal for 12 stories on Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5906.368s">[Bears]</a>: it's I think it's I know I just I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5910.029s">[Bears]</a>: I just want to put it out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5911.489s">[Bears]</a>: You know, if anyone is thinking that that is not been discussed at all, um, it would be, I think, significantly out of scope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5920.351s">[Bears]</a>: I do have the innest proposal that we accepted here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5924.252s">[Bears]</a>: Um, and project deliverables number two meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5928.272s">[Bears]</a>: This phase includes the meetings throughout the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5931.453s">[Bears]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5932.373s">[Bears]</a>: And there's meetings city staff monthly for the length of the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5937.236s">[Bears]</a>: City Council 10 to 15 throughout the three phases updates the Community Development Board one in each phases one and 22 and phase three public workshops to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5947.637s">[Bears]</a>: steering committee, six to eight stakeholder interviews, 12 to 15, four to five per phasers targeted to phases one and three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5956.082s">[Bears]</a>: So that is what the proposal was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5959.984s">[Bears]</a>: And I do know that NS Associates and planning department have done a lot of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5965.527s">[Bears]</a>: one to one discussions with folks in different neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5970.669s">[Bears]</a>: And I think something that we've discussed, as we discussed in the committee meeting last week, is trying to just be more clear and direct and use more of the city resources that are available to say, and our goal is to do this a month in advance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5986.055s">[Bears]</a>: Here's the meeting at which we will be talking about this specific area, and to try to use the city resources of the robocall system, as well as the different newsletters and digital outreach to inform people in each neighborhood, an area about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6003.69s">[Bears]</a>: the limited technological capability of us to hold public meetings in a hybrid fashion anywhere except for this room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6010.955s">[Bears]</a>: That has been a limiting factor, but we do want to get that out there in advance of each specific area of discussion so that folks can say, I live in this neighborhood, here's the meeting about my neighborhood, I can voice my input at that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6075.108s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6075.528s">[Bears]</a>: I'll go to Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6473.658s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6540.537s">[Bears]</a>: That's a good point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6542.557s">[Bears]</a>: That may be a typo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6548.188s">[Bears]</a>: We should just note that for Innis and the planning department as it moves through planning development, community development board, they can correct that and send it back to us amended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6587.057s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, and I will note, basically,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6589.887s">[Bears]</a>: We haven't won one of these districts before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6591.387s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think as a council, this council, Community Development Board will refer back an amended proposal to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6598.388s">[Bears]</a>: We could then make amendments at the public hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6601.869s">[Bears]</a>: If we feel we can either, we don't have to accept all the Community Development Board amendments, we can make additional amendments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6607.87s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just trying to look at the map from our last meeting, but I'll go to Councilor Collins, if you're finished.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6619.235s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6891.98s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6892.461s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, and I'd note that question resource I know someone who was just hired as the communications director for the parking department in Cambridge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6900.892s">[Bears]</a>: So, it's not to communication search for the city it's like one person per department which is wild level of resources that I would<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6909.56s">[Bears]</a>: love to see the city have just one note, the difference between MX one and MX two is the step backs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6918.047s">[Bears]</a>: So that's why there would be a change in the massing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6921.209s">[Bears]</a>: I was just looking at the map.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6922.19s">[Bears]</a>: That was a helpful reference point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6923.911s">[Bears]</a>: It is still maximum six in the MX two, but the step back is different versus the MX one on the motion of vice president Collins, seconded by council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6933.939s">[Bears]</a>: Let me to refer this amendment to the community development board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6937.162s">[Bears]</a>: Is there any further discussion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6940.737s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, is there any discussion by members of the public?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6943.318s">[Bears]</a>: You can raise your hand on Zoom or come to the podium in the chamber.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6950.699s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Melanie Tringali.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6952.98s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6954.58s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7011.614s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, a lot of those are based on the existing use table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7017.038s">[Bears]</a>: CDB means Special Permit Granting Authority is the Community Development Board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7022.406s">[Bears]</a>: One thing that we're planning to do at the end of the project is realign the use table and take a second look at the special permitting, special permit granting authority for the uses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7034.677s">[Bears]</a>: But most of this, basically anything that's not a new use, which I think is highlighted in bold, is essentially following the special permit currently in the use table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7075.122s">[Bears]</a>: Okay, on the motion by Councilor Collins seconded by Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7078.865s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7101.291s">[Bears]</a>: Communications from the mayor 24485 dear to the honorable president members of the city council regarding proposed way to just for the parking union I respect the request and recommend the city council approve the following amendments to the revised ordinances chapter 66 article two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7157.145s">[Bears]</a>: Do we have any questions for Director Crowley?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7162.269s">[Bears]</a>: I have one or Councilor Callahan looks like we have one there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7216.5s">[Bears]</a>: I think this probably reflects a recently negotiated collective bargaining agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7222.082s">[Bears]</a>: Go to Director Crowley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7286.849s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7324.038s">[Bears]</a>: It doesn't have to wait for advertising and then wait another month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7545.461s">[Bears]</a>: So I'll go to Councilor Collins if there's anything you'd like to add.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7551.264s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7552.955s">[Bears]</a>: Seems like we're all in agreement here on the motion by Councilors are probably seconded by Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7573.563s">[Bears]</a>: Cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7573.943s">[Bears]</a>: Are you sticking around are you done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7577.484s">[Bears]</a>: No, no, I don't think you need to, I just wanted to check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7582.149s">[Bears]</a>: All right, 24 487 offered by the mayor capital stabilization fund appropriation requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7590.219s">[Bears]</a>: We have dear President Bears and members of the city council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approves the following appropriations, the capital stabilization fund, engine three truck pump replacement in the amount of $51,643 and 24 cents, cemetery soil removal in the amount $120,000 and zero cents, grant match for the municipal vulnerability preparedness action grant for updating the 2019 climate change of vulnerability assessment and developing an urban forest master plan in the amount of $24,600.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7620.68s">[Bears]</a>: and zero cents and city hall Howard all the memorial chambers window restoration and the amount of $322,500 and zero cents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7628.168s">[Bears]</a>: As your honorable body knows any appropriation from the stabilization account requires two thirds majority vote of the city council capital stabilization fund currently has a balance of $3,923,737.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7639.76s">[Bears]</a>: given the appropriations made by the Council of the State, if all of the above are approved, the Capital Stabilization Fund would have $3,404,993.76 that remains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7649.264s">[Bears]</a>: Fire Chief Evans will be available to answer questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7652.526s">[Bears]</a>: Well, Chief Evans is here, DPW Commissioner McIvern's here, Paul Riggi's here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7656.928s">[Bears]</a>: So we can go first to engine three, truck pump replacement, we'll go to Chief Evans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7867.559s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7868.5s">[Bears]</a>: And I do have us penciled in December 11 for a meeting on stabilization funds capital planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7873.925s">[Bears]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7875.426s">[Bears]</a>: There's the B paper by Councilor Scarpelli to request an update on the, the capital plan regarding the fire apparatus, the trucks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7887.751s">[Bears]</a>: Any further questions for Chief Evans on the pump repair replacement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7894.637s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7895.237s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Chief, and we'll move next to cemetery soil removal and the grant match with Director McIvern, or Commissioner McIvern, my apologies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7981.617s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7986.081s">[Bears]</a>: Oh, yeah, I touch it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8031.417s">[Bears]</a>: This is in the back, if you've ever been, it's a giant pile of dirt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8039.571s">[Bears]</a>: It's like a pile of grass now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8059.304s">[Bears]</a>: I know as a member of the MMA's Public Works Committee, Mass Municipal Association, we talk often about the cost of remediating and removing soil.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8069.694s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, and it's a huge expense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8073.497s">[Bears]</a>: All right, I'll go to Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8137.242s">[Bears]</a>: Great, we'll go to Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8176.058s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8180.842s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, we'll go to the grant match on the MVP action grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8185.545s">[Bears]</a>: Anything else on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8188.967s">[Bears]</a>: Anything else you want to say on that, Tim?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8191.329s">[Bears]</a>: Nope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8192.83s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8194.851s">[Bears]</a>: Then we can finish out with all the memorial chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8197.873s">[Bears]</a>: Then we can take public participation on the item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8200.615s">[Bears]</a>: We have Howard Alderman Memorial Chamber's window restoration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8203.457s">[Bears]</a>: I'm guessing this has something to do with when I walked in here and there was broken glass after a windstorm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8209.324s">[Bears]</a>: maybe hopefully more than that too, but I will go to Director, Facilities Manager, Ricky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8214.67s">[Bears]</a>: Facilities Director, Ricky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8225.121s">[Bears]</a>: I'm doing well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8225.742s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you so much for being here and sticking with us through the pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8309.994s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, go to Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8313.795s">[Bears]</a>: All right, then we will go to Councilor, anyone else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8319.516s">[Bears]</a>: I just have a question, Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8323.557s">[Bears]</a>: I'm assuming it'll be like historically accurate, but also environmentally, we'll be looking at, you know, modern windows to address the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8331.929s">[Bears]</a>: heat issue and make sure that we're keeping heat and cool air in the chamber.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8335.672s">[Bears]</a>: I know that's a huge problem as well with these windows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8355.575s">[Bears]</a>: because of the historical status of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8358.437s">[Bears]</a>: And these are the original windows, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8365.804s">[Bears]</a>: So they're about 85 years old or so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8368.166s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8368.826s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8370.387s">[Bears]</a>: Any further questions on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8402.547s">[Bears]</a>: Are you invoking that on the whole paper?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8405.089s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8406.01s">[Bears]</a>: All four items?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8408.319s">[Bears]</a>: All right, on that invocation, this is tabled to the next regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8416.743s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Director Riggi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8417.723s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you to everyone who came out tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8426.987s">[Bears]</a>: 24-488, offered by the mayor, transfer and acquisition of rights in the public way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8430.489s">[Bears]</a>: Dear President Paris, members of the city council, I respectfully request and recommend your honorable body approve the following transfer and acquisition of rights in a paper way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8437.901s">[Bears]</a>: along Dexter Street, which will allow the mayor to enter into an agreement to release the city's rights to one half to the reference paper street in exchange for the city acquired rights to the other half of the same paper street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8450.633s">[Bears]</a>: We have the building commissioner available to answer questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8459.285s">[Bears]</a>: And I'd like a motion to waive the remainder of the reading this is just seems highly technical and I'd like someone to explain it on the motion of Councilor Tseng seconded by second by Councilor Scott to waive the reading all those in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8470.97s">[Bears]</a>: Opposed motion passes we'll go to the Commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8476.352s">[Bears]</a>: And are you representing the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8945.726s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, if you look at the state property map, you can see the paper way between 2 Joseph and then the city's parcel at 0 Albion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8955.351s">[Bears]</a>: The three next to each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=658.014s">[Bears]</a>: 21st regular meeting Medford City Council November 12 2024 is called to order Mr. please call the roll Council Callahan, Vice President Collins Council is our Council Leming, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Tseng, President, President Bears present seven present none absent the meeting is called to order please rise to salute the flag.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=692.89s">[Bears]</a>: Announcements accolades remembrances reports and records records the records of the meeting of October 29 2024 pastor Councilor Callahan Councilor Callahan how did you find those records.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=706.698s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion of Councilor Callahan to approve seconded by seconded by Councilor Collins Mr. Clerk please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=727.389s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, 70 affirmative negative the motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=731.331s">[Bears]</a>: Refer to committee for further discussion just a reminder that the intent of this section is for us to refer items to committee for further discussion, no final action will be taken on these items during this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=743.844s">[Bears]</a>: 24491 resolution to discuss compensation ordinance for elected officials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=747.145s">[Bears]</a>: It looks like there's an amended version resolution to discuss ordinance to disallow the city council from passing any salary changes that affect sitting elected officials by councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=756.267s">[Bears]</a>: Whereas only the city council can change the salaries of Medford elected officials, mayor, city council and school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=761.388s">[Bears]</a>: And whereas there's no way for elected officials to adjust elected official salaries for inflation or general cost of living increases without the city council voting to change elected official salaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=770.211s">[Bears]</a>: And whereas there is a personal incentive for city Councilors to increase their own salaries, whereas the city council increasing salaries that are increasing salaries of others is viewed as in form of impropriety and be it resolved that this governance committee take up an ordinance to disallow the city council from passing any salary changes that affect sitting elected officials and to encourage city council to consider Cola adjustments for elected officials in the next cycle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=793.456s">[Bears]</a>: I would just note before turning this over for a brief, I hope, discussion or introduction by the proponent before the motion to refer to committee that I don't think an ordinance would affect this at all we already have three charter and state laws that affect this so as a plan a charter chapter 4317 a.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=813.599s">[Bears]</a>: already applies to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=816.36s">[Bears]</a>: Chapter 71, section 52 governs how school committees are compensated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=820.261s">[Bears]</a>: And then the acts of 2002 chapter 447 is a Medford specific law that would supersede any ordinance passed by the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=828.583s">[Bears]</a>: So the way to go at this is with charter amendment, not with an ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=832.844s">[Bears]</a>: But with that, I will go to Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=920.299s">[Bears]</a>: We're on the motion of Councilor Callahan to refer to governance committee seconded by Councilor Collins, excuse me, please wait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=926.562s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=927.882s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion by members of the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=930.844s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=958.093s">[Bears]</a>: Well, what I can say is that state law controls here no matter what, but I will go to councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=964.559s">[Bears]</a>: You've amended your resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1194.957s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1195.498s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1195.718s">[Bears]</a>: And I would just note again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1199.355s">[Bears]</a>: The existing law for the school committee is Chapter 71 Section 52, which means we have to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1205.139s">[Bears]</a>: And the existing law for the city is the Mass General Law Acts of 2002 Chapter 447, which I think was an attempt to in 2003 to try to get this to be more of a something that happens as<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1223.252s">[Bears]</a>: part of the course of other folks, specifically that says that the mayor and the council salaries would increase the same amount as the director of budgets, finance director, director of community development, city clerk, city treasurer, city solicitor, chief assessor, the average percentage for those offices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1243.563s">[Bears]</a>: So those are the current laws that apply.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1245.004s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion from members of the council before I go back to Councilor Callahan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1250.287s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, I'll go to Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1389.821s">[Bears]</a>: So first of all, that has been removed and that's like... I think the problem is that we didn't need to have this discussion right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1398.939s">[Bears]</a>: That's the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1399.84s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, I just think this is a waste of everyone's time to be completely honest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1403.623s">[Bears]</a>: There's a law in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1404.644s">[Bears]</a>: And in fact, the city council and the mayor, like what the law is, is that when other people's salaries go up, the senior management of the city, the council and the mayor salary would also go up by that same average percentage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1415.532s">[Bears]</a>: That's the current law on the books.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1417.274s">[Bears]</a>: That's what happened in June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1418.875s">[Bears]</a>: So I think there's misrepresentation on all sides of what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1421.737s">[Bears]</a>: And I think that's just my perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1425.7s">[Bears]</a>: And I apologize for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1427.901s">[Bears]</a>: just giving my opinion from the chair without recognizing anybody else, but I just didn't like, really don't think this is a productive conversation on any front, because everybody seems pretty confused and frustrated on all sides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1443.915s">[Bears]</a>: There was a motion to refer it to committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1445.397s">[Bears]</a>: It was seconded, Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1451.102s">[Bears]</a>: Give me one second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1451.843s">[Bears]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1584.675s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1585.455s">[Bears]</a>: I'm gonna go to Councilor Leming, then Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1600.413s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just gonna let him finish and you can go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1617.044s">[Bears]</a>: Well, I think we just did a very good thing for our community, but...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1627.587s">[Bears]</a>: Let's not get back and forth, guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1630.028s">[Bears]</a>: I hear you, but let's not go for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1634.689s">[Bears]</a>: We went through the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1638.049s">[Bears]</a>: You did publicly represent the organization, so...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1641.007s">[Bears]</a>: People talk about me and our revolution from this council floor all the time, George.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1646.929s">[Bears]</a>: Do what, George?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1653.771s">[Bears]</a>: Okay, people are just saying what they want to say, George.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1655.731s">[Bears]</a>: You say a lot of stuff all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1657.072s">[Bears]</a>: I'll let you talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1660.733s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1661.653s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1767.14s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1769.902s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1784.777s">[Bears]</a>: All right, there's a motion to refer to committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1788.04s">[Bears]</a>: Is there a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1791.102s">[Bears]</a>: All right, then we any further discussion by members of the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1797.153s">[Bears]</a>: Members of the public, three minutes, same address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1800.634s">[Bears]</a>: We'll alternate between Zoom and in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1809.758s">[Bears]</a>: You can go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1813.737s">[Bears]</a>: You can go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1826.0s">[Bears]</a>: I wasn't behind this, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1833.611s">[Bears]</a>: There's no organization behind this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1839.795s">[Bears]</a>: I just, you can't lie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1858.962s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. South, if you're gonna be disrespectful, we're not gonna continue here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1865.405s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. South, if you're gonna be disrespectful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1990.626s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. South as you know the city council does not negotiate union contracts, and this was proposed by one Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1998.131s">[Bears]</a>: I don't support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1999.932s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think it was something that we should be bringing up right now but we can continue to say whatever we want for political purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2009.278s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know what that means.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2010.599s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know what that means.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2015.282s">[Bears]</a>: There's no overseers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2016.283s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2017.143s">[Bears]</a>: Well, you can believe, sir, please stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2021.53s">[Bears]</a>: You're an embarrassment, Mr. South.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2028.153s">[Bears]</a>: Get out of here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2031.695s">[Bears]</a>: You should leave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2033.396s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Self, on the motion to recess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2038.239s">[Bears]</a>: No, I don't, I don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2040.48s">[Bears]</a>: If you can't handle, you need to work a little better at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2044.762s">[Bears]</a>: And you maybe need to go to a little anger management.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2047.844s">[Bears]</a>: You're disgusting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2414.295s">[Bears]</a>: The emotions are running a little high.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2417.758s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to the podium, name and address the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2420.36s">[Bears]</a>: And Nadine, if you're here in person, I'm guessing your hand's not up here on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2425.245s">[Bears]</a>: All right, you're good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2427.827s">[Bears]</a>: It just would have been your turn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2428.888s">[Bears]</a>: All right, name and address the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2432.591s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2587.528s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2588.509s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to the podium name and address the record please you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2607.0s">[Bears]</a>: It is what it is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2609.0s">[Bears]</a>: I'm behind the podium and I'm going to restart your three minutes because you're nice to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2629.178s">[Bears]</a>: Let's just let him, let's just go through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2630.579s">[Bears]</a>: And the initial one that mentioned it, the Councilor has edited it to remove it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2657.368s">[Bears]</a>: We're going back to three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2725.953s">[Bears]</a>: School Committee member Bramley, you will have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2728.195s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2940.666s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3131.468s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you for your time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3144.024s">[Bears]</a>: It's a new system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3290.36s">[Bears]</a>: 30 seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3293.182s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Nadine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3298.947s">[Bears]</a>: I'm gonna go to Zoom real quick and then we'll come back at Stone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3302.685s">[Bears]</a>: I'm gonna go to Ken Garrow on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3305.988s">[Bears]</a>: Ken, name and address for the record for this little three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3313.433s">[Bears]</a>: Oh, you're sounding a little funky there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3320.619s">[Bears]</a>: How about this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3322.18s">[Bears]</a>: That's better, yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3351.166s">[Bears]</a>: Thankfully, I actually was able to... Councilor Scarpelli has just noted that he is not a board member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3356.869s">[Bears]</a>: ...organization that I follow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3483.749s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3484.19s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to the podium name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3486.571s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3877.908s">[Bears]</a>: I believe the proposal as it stands is that the City Council could not increase its own salary or the salary of any other elected official until, if an increase were to go into effect, it would go into effect after the next election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3902.707s">[Bears]</a>: The current compensation is, I believe $30,400.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3905.648s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3906.088s">[Bears]</a>: 30,000 what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3906.289s">[Bears]</a>: 400, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3906.629s">[Bears]</a>: And other stipends or other funds, US dollars come into your?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3972.406s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think that information is immediately available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3979.219s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3979.719s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3987.302s">[Bears]</a>: Had a conversation about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3990.283s">[Bears]</a>: Believe we have a motion to refer this to the Governance Committee by Councilor Callahan as amended and seconded by Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3999.647s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4002.268s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4132.399s">[Bears]</a>: I'm sorry, go ahead, continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4188.322s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4189.143s">[Bears]</a>: And I'm just going to go real quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4191.244s">[Bears]</a>: I think there's two things here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4192.184s">[Bears]</a>: I think there are the facts and the substance of the matter right now, the way it works by state law and charter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4201.522s">[Bears]</a>: is that the school committee compensation is set by a vote of the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4206.425s">[Bears]</a>: The city council controls the amount and the timing for school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4210.907s">[Bears]</a>: For the mayor and the city council, the city council, that is actually set by an average of the, let me read it exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4223.477s">[Bears]</a>: The salaries may be increased at the recommendation of the Mayor and the approval of the City Council if the salaries of each of the following officers of the City of Medford are increased.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4231.725s">[Bears]</a>: Director of Budgets and Personnel, Finance Director Auditor, Director of Community Development, City Clerk, City Treasurer,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4238.894s">[Bears]</a>: collector city solicitor and the chief assessor appraiser.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4242.235s">[Bears]</a>: Any salary increase for the office of mayor and the members of the city council should not increase exceed the average percentage by which the salaries for the aforesaid officers is increased.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4250.398s">[Bears]</a>: The city council does not have the power to set its own salary at whatever it amount tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4255.94s">[Bears]</a>: There are restrictions right now on what the city council can do in terms of the salaries of the mayor and the city council and it's that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4264.173s">[Bears]</a>: If the mayor puts it forward and the council approves, they can go up by the average of essentially the main management of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4271.277s">[Bears]</a>: That's the current law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4273.358s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan, I believe's intent, and I think to be honest, it was not a particularly clear resolution to make the point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4281.728s">[Bears]</a>: It references other city charters, but talks about an ordinance, it references COLA, but I believe the intent was to move away from what I just read, which is that the city council and mayor salary can increase by the average of essentially city managing staff, to that the city council's salary could not increase in the term in which the city council voted, current city council is sitting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4303.481s">[Bears]</a>: I think that's a substance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4306.923s">[Bears]</a>: I think on the optics and the discussion,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4312.659s">[Bears]</a>: people aren't going to go into the substance all the time and discuss the good faith substance that someone may be proposing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4319.003s">[Bears]</a>: We've had a lot of contentious conversations about compensation that we can call it salaries or stipends or whatever else we wanna call it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4327.488s">[Bears]</a>: This council has had it for many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4329.81s">[Bears]</a>: There were discussions in the 2000s and the 2010s and the 1990s about compensation for the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4336.654s">[Bears]</a>: The city council in 2016,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4338.915s">[Bears]</a>: or sorry 2013 completely changed the way the city council is compensated because it used to be based on what Andy was talking about pencils and supplies and travel and all of these kind of nebulous things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4352.229s">[Bears]</a>: So there's been a lot of there's a lot of legislative history on the compensation elected officials in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4357.076s">[Bears]</a>: And I think what people are expressing, and I think those people maybe are both folks behind the other side of the rail who are saying, I don't like that we're talking about raising elected officials' compensation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4369.607s">[Bears]</a>: And to be quite frankly, I think what you were saying, Councilor Callahan, about some of us who felt that since school committee hadn't changed since 2000 and the city council since 2016, that following the laws as are laid out to adjust that compensation was a fair thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4384.62s">[Bears]</a>: but we also didn't want to be having this conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4387.221s">[Bears]</a>: At least I think so by the looks on everybody's faces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4389.522s">[Bears]</a>: I think George doesn't want to be having it either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4391.763s">[Bears]</a>: And I can't see Justin right now, but I bet he doesn't want to either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4394.484s">[Bears]</a>: So the substance, it's a fair discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4400.307s">[Bears]</a>: How do we do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4401.147s">[Bears]</a>: How do elected official salaries get changed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4405.048s">[Bears]</a>: It's a state law and a charter issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4407.429s">[Bears]</a>: We're going to have discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4408.57s">[Bears]</a>: I think the charter study committee actually has some recommendations around that, that we'll be discussing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4414.872s">[Bears]</a>: But then there's also what happened last week, what happened this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4419.214s">[Bears]</a>: And I think we all acknowledge there's some people in the room who are happy question six didn't pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4424.956s">[Bears]</a>: There's some people in the room who are happy question seven and eight did pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4428.678s">[Bears]</a>: Nobody's happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4430.589s">[Bears]</a>: There's a mixed result.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4432.09s">[Bears]</a>: We don't even have to get into other elections that happened last Tuesday that I'm sure a lot of people have a lot of feelings about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4437.174s">[Bears]</a>: But I think that's more what the question is here than the substance of, and some people may well be happy about, as I see as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4448.122s">[Bears]</a>: But I think it's just like, is this the conversation we'll be having today?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4451.004s">[Bears]</a>: And I think a lot of us feel the answer is no, but beyond that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4458.763s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go back to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4460.344s">[Bears]</a>: We'll just do a couple more minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4462.604s">[Bears]</a>: Go ahead, Harry, let me turn on the mic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4465.805s">[Bears]</a>: You got three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4672.14s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4673.021s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Harry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4673.581s">[Bears]</a>: And I do just want to know that we have heard from a lot of our union partners here before the rail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4681.454s">[Bears]</a>: We don't participate in the negotiations, but we do, what our small part is, we do approve the final agreements and we have, I think, consistently waived readings to move agreed collective bargaining agreements to get the pay to the folks as soon as those agreements have been met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4701.939s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to the podium, name and address for the record, three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4841.98s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4846.221s">[Bears]</a>: I do hope that the rest of the meeting was less of an SS then, which I think was the swear word you wanted to say, but less of a mess then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4859.847s">[Bears]</a>: But you know, we can have the civil conversations as Nick said, but yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4868.379s">[Bears]</a>: All right, we've had the discussion on the motion of Councilor Callahan as amended by Councilor Callahan a seconded by Vice President Collins, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4879.324s">[Bears]</a>: This is to refer to governance Council Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4909.237s">[Bears]</a>: And whereas during the election of November 5, the voters of Medford considered a budget override provision in question seven providing funds for among other purposes fiscal year 2025 general operations of the Department of Public Works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4920.2s">[Bears]</a>: including but not limited to additional staff for road and sidewalk infrastructure repair, and that ballot question was successful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5034.627s">[Bears]</a>: And whereas the cost of planning city trees is primarily in labor to plant the trees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5038.912s">[Bears]</a>: and whereas Medford only has one full-time staff member dedicated to our trees, the tree warden, and whereas Medford currently contracts out for tree planting, which is more expensive than planting with an in-house crew, and whereas trees are a vital part of fighting climate change, helping cool buildings and streets in the summer, and add to the beauty of our city, and whereas Medford has many residents who want to volunteer to plant city trees,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5060.291s">[Bears]</a>: Now therefore be it resolved that the Public Works and Facilities Committee invite you BW Commissioner McGibbon to attend an upcoming meeting to begin discussing the possibility of allowing Metro residents to volunteer to help plant city trees on the motion to refer to public works and facilities committee Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5206.917s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5210.199s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, affirmative, non-negative, the motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5212.34s">[Bears]</a>: 24484, this was tabled from our last meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5216.202s">[Bears]</a>: This is a resolution to adopt the local options of the HEROES Act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5219.664s">[Bears]</a>: I believe we heard back from council and the city solicitor, or sorry, council and the city assessor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5227.093s">[Bears]</a>: fingers crossed on that city solicitor, that this was sufficient as to form and that the impact would not be significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5236.957s">[Bears]</a>: It would be addressed by the overlay, but I will go to Councilor Leopold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5274.241s">[Bears]</a>: So the amended version would read<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5276.773s">[Bears]</a>: be it further resolved that the city of Medford accept general laws chapter 59 section 5 clause 22 J which authorizes an annual increase in the amount of the exemption granted under general laws chapter 59 section 5 clause 22 22 a 22 b 22 c 22 e and 22 f by 100% of the personal exemption amount subject to the conditions in clause 22 J to be effective July 1 2025 that is correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5293.149s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5305.521s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion to approve by Councilor Leming, as amended by Councilor Leming, seconded by Councilor Callahan, any further discussion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5313.063s">[Bears]</a>: And just to note, this is expanding property tax exemptions for veterans pursuant to the HERO Act, which was passed as Chapter 178 of the Acts of 2024 by the legislature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5325.765s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5433.268s">[Bears]</a>: cemetery soil removal $120,000 grant match for the municipal vulnerability vulnerability preparedness action grant<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5441.136s">[Bears]</a>: for updating the 2019 climate change vulnerability assessment and developing an urban forest master plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5447.038s">[Bears]</a>: That's $24,600 and the city hall, all the memorial chambers, window restoration, $322,500.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5451.98s">[Bears]</a>: This is appropriation requests from the capital stabilization fund requiring a two third majority vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5460.283s">[Bears]</a>: The stabilization fund has a balance of $3,923,737.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5461.643s">[Bears]</a>: And if these appropriations remain all approved,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5470.14s">[Bears]</a>: It would be at $3,404,993.76.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5471.76s">[Bears]</a>: And at the last meeting, this was a B paper amendment requesting an update on the mayor's capital plan, particularly as it relates to additional fire apparatus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5482.386s">[Bears]</a>: And subsequently to that, Councilor Scarpelli invoked rule 21 table in this paper until the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5548.558s">[Bears]</a>: Gaston, name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5550.139s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5554.982s">[Bears]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5556.243s">[Bears]</a>: I'll get there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5661.215s">[Bears]</a>: I would have to go back and double check the recording, but I believe they bid out for the engine three truck pump and it came in at a higher cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5668.841s">[Bears]</a>: So this is covering a difference in a bidded amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5673.044s">[Bears]</a>: The cemetery swill removal, I think will go to bid and is based on an estimate or a quote or multiple quotes, but would still go to bid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5679.488s">[Bears]</a>: The grant matches based on the grant and I, I'd have to double check 30 be, but I think because the grant match it's not subject to fitting right anything over 10,000 except there's some certain exceptions legal legal services, and a couple other things aren't subject to 30 be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5694.885s">[Bears]</a>: And then the third, the fourth one though, it is something that's already the windows, I believe the windows is definitely Yeah, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5700.95s">[Bears]</a>: And but I believe this is based.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5703.091s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Ricky said that he had an estimate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5705.393s">[Bears]</a>: And that's how he determined this cost and then it would go out to bid through the 30.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5708.255s">[Bears]</a>: Okay, perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5730.883s">[Bears]</a>: Okay, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5731.905s">[Bears]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5769.709s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5770.169s">[Bears]</a>: I didn't want to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5776.89s">[Bears]</a>: Right, if they're, what is that I can't remember what that's called.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5781.071s">[Bears]</a>: It's the state bid list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5781.891s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5785.191s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5786.151s">[Bears]</a>: All right, on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli seconded by Vice President Collins to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5791.172s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. please call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5807.604s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, I mean affirmative, none negative, the motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5811.086s">[Bears]</a>: Any further public participation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5813.408s">[Bears]</a>: Take public participation on any item that was not on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5818.051s">[Bears]</a>: All right, Andy, name and address the record or Ellen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5825.666s">[Bears]</a>: Ellen, name and address for record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5826.566s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5886.358s">[Bears]</a>: I think there is only so much we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5892.86s">[Bears]</a>: Most of the time, most people are respectful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5896.041s">[Bears]</a>: I think we've made some strides even in the last few months from some<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5901.081s">[Bears]</a>: less than respectful interactions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5903.462s">[Bears]</a>: To be quite frank, I think this was a situation where somebody needs to check themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5912.064s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know what else to say about that, but you know, we had an individual who has persistently and consistently not felt that he feels the need to respect this chair, particularly me, in a very personal way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5927.548s">[Bears]</a>: So other than replacing me, if anyone wants the job,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5932.067s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know that that'll solve this problem, but we have had, we've tried to institute some decorum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5938.951s">[Bears]</a>: I was able to, you know, now with the new system to shut off the microphone at the three minute mark, but I understand your distress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5947.476s">[Bears]</a>: I share in your distress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5948.337s">[Bears]</a>: I'm sure you could tell that I was frustrated and felt the need to combat it maybe in a way that I should have breathed through a little more, but yeah, sometimes some people,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5961.124s">[Bears]</a>: want to come here to make a show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5962.885s">[Bears]</a>: And given that we are an open forum, it's difficult to manage sometimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5978.157s">[Bears]</a>: I think we could consider that for sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5985.543s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5986.524s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Mr. Castagnetti.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5987.705s">[Bears]</a>: Three minutes, name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=6170.19s">[Bears]</a>: I think exactly three minutes to boot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=6180.319s">[Bears]</a>: I think to Andy's point, Albert Einstein, and I'll throw in famed socialist Albert Einstein said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=6187.995s">[Bears]</a>: I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=6194.379s">[Bears]</a>: And that's not a world any of us wanna live in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=6196.98s">[Bears]</a>: So let's hope not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=6202.764s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=6204.264s">[Bears]</a>: Any further public participation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=6205.865s">[Bears]</a>: I see no hands on Zoom, no one at the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=6210.028s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=6211.689s">[Bears]</a>: The motion to adjourn by Councilor Lazzaro, seconded by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=6214.27s">[Bears]</a>: Seconded by Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=6215.411s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=6230.24s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=6231.522s">[Bears]</a>: President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=6232.222s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=6232.443s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=390.114s">[Bears]</a>: I ended up at City Hall and it's here to Anna setting up zoom right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=397.818s">[Bears]</a>: Oh geez.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=398.358s">[Bears]</a>: Oh no I was here anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=402.78s">[Bears]</a>: But I think maybe apologies to Anna.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=406.762s">[Bears]</a>: I had a meeting here at five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=512.283s">[Bears]</a>: He has them, sorry, he sent them to Paula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=515.405s">[Bears]</a>: Paula's gonna present them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=516.386s">[Bears]</a>: Okay, cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1251.373s">[Bears]</a>: Just to clarify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1252.594s">[Bears]</a>: So this language for the major renovation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1255.756s">[Bears]</a>: This is the language from the building code that the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1264.957s">[Bears]</a>: Great, and then for the X and the AE for FEMA, does X correspond to the 1% chance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1271.079s">[Bears]</a>: Does AE correspond to the 0.2% chance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1273.64s">[Bears]</a>: Just where would those fit in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1847.958s">[Bears]</a>: Um wait, uh, President Barry's, uh, I was later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1852.44s">[Bears]</a>: No, that was me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1853.12s">[Bears]</a>: I was late on that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1853.96s">[Bears]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1855.521s">[Bears]</a>: I would just throw out the idea of maybe a 25% at least 25% affordable, um, as a minimum threshold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1863.583s">[Bears]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1863.743s">[Bears]</a>: I also just had a question about how.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1867.184s">[Bears]</a>: This interfaces with the solar ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1871.306s">[Bears]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1872.586s">[Bears]</a>: You know, because I think if we're talking about some.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1876.84s">[Bears]</a>: you know, relatively large buildings with relatively small side setbacks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1881.043s">[Bears]</a>: And we also have the solar ordinance requiring solar on the rooftop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1886.326s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just wondering how much that limits the green roof type solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2302.59s">[Bears]</a>: All right, so Council President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2318.143s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2318.864s">[Bears]</a>: Um, and on that front, I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2321.479s">[Bears]</a>: It seems like we're kind of getting this in, the framework in, and there's just a couple of things that we're gonna work through as we adopt more districts and we're able to do the research on the community solar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2332.948s">[Bears]</a>: But I just was wondering, maybe it's a question for Paula, looking at other ordinances, or maybe a question for the building commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2340.353s">[Bears]</a>: Are there other places or other zoning requirements where we use the same approach that you described, Mr. Commissioner, with the bond question versus a temporary occupancy permit?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2354.045s">[Bears]</a>: Scott?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2406.32s">[Bears]</a>: And if I may, Mr. Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2410.043s">[Bears]</a>: It sounds to me like the concern is if they finish up in November, they're not doing plantings till the spring, if they already have all the permits and approvals they need from the city, maybe they just never follow through with their landscaping plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2420.973s">[Bears]</a>: Is that essentially the concern we're trying to correct for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2615.592s">[Bears]</a>: Council President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2617.194s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, they could also be incorporated during the CD board hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2621.158s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2688.661s">[Bears]</a>: I'll just I'll make a motion to refer out to the regular meeting pending the discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2693.426s">[Bears]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3160.592s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks, I just wanted to note Alicia and I both posted some links to the documents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3166.974s">[Bears]</a>: Apologies that they weren't up on the council portal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3169.995s">[Bears]</a>: They went up, we got them after the final, the agenda went up online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3173.957s">[Bears]</a>: So I forgot to upload them, but I just uploaded them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3176.458s">[Bears]</a>: And I think Alicia,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3178.32s">[Bears]</a>: beat me to it and had them uploaded to the city website before this meeting, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3258.926s">[Bears]</a>: You can take the pending further discussion part out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3261.147s">[Bears]</a>: We had it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3261.787s">[Bears]</a>: I just wanted to make sure we didn't do it until we heard from the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3552.055s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3552.575s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3552.975s">[Bears]</a>: And we definitely, you know, I hear what you're saying, George, and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3557.17s">[Bears]</a>: We've had some discussions about how we're going to get the word out going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3562.013s">[Bears]</a>: I think the first thing to say is that for Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3566.317s">[Bears]</a>: The next meeting we're going to discuss, this is going to be December 11th, and the plan is to get that out through all the different city channels, an announcement, and save the date for that community meeting, digital flyer, and I believe we're going to work on a robocall for that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3582.465s">[Bears]</a>: And then for the meetings from January through May, the plan is to put together a full<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3590.028s">[Bears]</a>: uh release and web page that talks about different neighborhoods that we're going to be talking about each month and my goal is also to have hopefully um along with that the meeting dates and get those out a month in advance and do uh the follow-up of the announcement um the flyer putting it out in the city newsletter and the planning newsletter and doing a robocall to those neighborhoods uh in advance of the meetings so that we can um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3618.351s">[Bears]</a>: Get that message out more clearly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3620.795s">[Bears]</a>: So we talked about that after our last meeting and we want to Just get that a little cleaner and tighter so that folks know a little more in advance and that we have the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3633.181s">[Bears]</a>: Um, all of the different city outreach tools at our disposal are used to reach folks about those meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3983.868s">[Bears]</a>: do you take public participation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4108.248s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I was, I don't think we have kind of like a neighborhoods program per se.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4112.21s">[Bears]</a>: Um, and I'm not sure what the capacity would be to, uh, coordinate that, uh, with the communications officer, the community relations, uh, staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4123.938s">[Bears]</a>: Um, but I mean, I think that's the very least something we can try to do is also share this information out through the community liaisons and they might have, uh, through the health department, they might have some,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4135.45s">[Bears]</a>: grounding in different neighborhoods of the city, but yeah, I don't know what the mayor's team in community relations and constituent services has in terms of volunteers around like a neighborhood program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4264.784s">[Bears]</a>: There's no one in the chamber, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=14.348s">[Bears]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4974.528s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4975.449s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you to my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4977.81s">[Bears]</a>: I won't reiterate the points and discussions that have already been made, but I do want to focus in on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4983.596s">[Bears]</a>: specifics around the legality here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4986.438s">[Bears]</a>: I agree that it's shameful that corporations have managed to get the government to pass legislation and write regulations that gives them so much authority and takes authority away from local governments that are really responsible for these decisions at the end of the day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5001.107s">[Bears]</a>: But I do want to propose a B paper, and I'll get to the text of it in a second, that focuses on the legal matters here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5009.312s">[Bears]</a>: There were two<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5010.891s">[Bears]</a>: orders issued by the FCC in 2018.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5013.213s">[Bears]</a>: An August 2018 moratoria order and a September 2018 small cell order that essentially is the reason that we're in this position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5022.979s">[Bears]</a>: Completely limits the ability of local governments to address the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5027.422s">[Bears]</a>: Those orders have been litigated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5028.783s">[Bears]</a>: Communities have challenged those orders and all the way up to the Ninth District Court, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and the litigation has been denied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5041.038s">[Bears]</a>: Courts have said that the FCC order is a blanket, that that is, you know, that that's the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5046.862s">[Bears]</a>: So I agree that with what Councilor Knight said especially, this is not, you know, something that we should be voting on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5054.926s">[Bears]</a>: But at the end of the day, unless we have a change in federal law and unless state laws are changed, if there's litigation, it'll be moved up to the chain, you know, moving up the chain of courts and eventually Verizon will force its way through anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5069.765s">[Bears]</a>: and it will also cost the city money according to the FCC order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5075.348s">[Bears]</a>: So I'd like to propose a B paper specifically focused on the legal question, which is that the city council request that the Biden administration, the FCC, and our federal delegation amend the FCC's August 2018 moratoria order and September 2018 small cell order to remove restrictions on local government authority to regulate the design<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5096.766s">[Bears]</a>: replacement and installation of 5G small cell transmitters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5101.189s">[Bears]</a>: And that we receive a reply within 30 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5103.711s">[Bears]</a>: And Mr. Clerk, I'm going to send that to you right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5106.754s">[Bears]</a>: And I appreciate the comments of my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5108.435s">[Bears]</a>: I just wanted to focus specifically on that legal question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5111.897s">[Bears]</a>: Because, you know, we may find ourselves right back in the same position after years of lawsuits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=291.8s">[Bears]</a>: I think we lost the council chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1559.913s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. President, could we hear from attorney wall before we go into questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2412.584s">[Bears]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2412.784s">[Bears]</a>: We can't hear if people aren't speaking into the microphone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2670.345s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2673.027s">[Bears]</a>: I want to thank you for your presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2675.428s">[Bears]</a>: Thank the CD board and the Conservation Commission members for what seemed to be some significant improvements since the start of the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2683.872s">[Bears]</a>: I think my questions may be better suited for Patrick from BJ's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2694.156s">[Bears]</a>: Hi, Patrick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2696.197s">[Bears]</a>: My first question is, how long do you expect this station to be operational?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2700.439s">[Bears]</a>: You know, 10 years, 20 years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2714.162s">[Bears]</a>: Um, and do you have an expectation of the annual revenue that you're going to be gaining from this facility?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2724.99s">[Bears]</a>: Um, I think that would be helpful for us to understand as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2728.212s">[Bears]</a>: Cause you know, I appreciate what you're saying about your customers, but I think you as a, as a business also have a vested interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2733.355s">[Bears]</a>: You wouldn't be putting this forward if it wasn't going to, to make you money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2738.018s">[Bears]</a>: Um, the third piece of this that I want to ask about is, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2744.011s">[Bears]</a>: If this project doesn't finally get final approval, would you commit to making some of the improvements around safety and environmental protection that are included in this plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2763.018s">[Bears]</a>: Or some of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2763.579s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, it seems like currently we have runoff going into a stream, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2780.041s">[Bears]</a>: No, I'm just wondering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2781.041s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, it just, you know, it kind of goes to, I appreciate the comments from my fellow Councilors, Scarpelli and Falco, you know, about stewardship and, you know, being a member of the community, it seems like there are some ongoing issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2797.272s">[Bears]</a>: And then finally, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2800.077s">[Bears]</a>: If, I guess, say there's a 15 year lifespan, what would the process be for removing the facility if it eventually closes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2837.629s">[Bears]</a>: Got it, I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2839.49s">[Bears]</a>: And the reason I ask is just with the commitments from major automakers to move to electric vehicles and the expectation that fossil fuels are no longer going to be the main way that we power transportation going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2853.857s">[Bears]</a>: To me, this seems like a little bit of a short-term plan<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2858.181s">[Bears]</a>: Um, and not necessarily where we're going in the long term to be installing a gas station at this late stage in, in our energy transition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2866.627s">[Bears]</a>: Um, so that's why I bring that up, you know, in 15 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2870.029s">[Bears]</a>: And is that, does do industry trends reflect what you expect the life of the station to be is 15 years based on the fact that, uh, vehicles are transitioning to electric.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2905.707s">[Bears]</a>: Do you expect that that could be a potential future outcome as well, a conversion to some sort of electric charging station?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2922.104s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2922.644s">[Bears]</a>: Well, I appreciate the answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2924.745s">[Bears]</a>: I share some of the concerns of my fellow Councilors, as well as some of these long-term concerns, and I would like to hear from the neighbors as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2931.209s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=6297.433s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=6302.047s">[Bears]</a>: I would just disagree with you on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=6303.428s">[Bears]</a>: I think the issue has been discussed, you know, if a councillor put it forward and there was discussion, they can no longer withdraw the paper and it's already gone through other committees as well, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=6362.128s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=6363.988s">[Bears]</a>: Just to clarify, yes means deny?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=6370.39s">[Bears]</a>: Then yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=6703.409s">[Bears]</a>: Rob, you mean to stop sharing and then share the other screen or share your whole screen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=6710.235s">[Bears]</a>: I think right now you're just sharing one file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=6728.13s">[Bears]</a>: I can stop it for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7039.697s">[Bears]</a>: We still can't see anything around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7042.522s">[Bears]</a>: Darn it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7587.906s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7589.127s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Rob, for your presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7590.608s">[Bears]</a>: If the three crews were permitted, if your full plan that you had sketched out was able to go into effect,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7598.84s">[Bears]</a>: Would that timeline include the resurfacing and recurbing of the project completed by the end of this construction season?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7697.57s">[Bears]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7698.531s">[Bears]</a>: And I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7700.512s">[Bears]</a>: So essentially, even if you were at full capacity this year, some element of milling and paving would still be done next year, next season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7711.657s">[Bears]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7713.558s">[Bears]</a>: And that would include the sidewalks and curbing along Winthrop Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7739.335s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks, Tim, if you could just quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7741.056s">[Bears]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7774.73s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7775.391s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7775.911s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Tim.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7777.742s">[Bears]</a>: I guess my last question is, if you can only use one crew this season, do you expect the project to go beyond next season?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7813.996s">[Bears]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7815.377s">[Bears]</a>: And Tim, I guess along those lines, given the size of this project, the scope of it, how long it's been going on compared to some of the other work going on this summer, do you think it might be possible to prioritize this project?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7942.073s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, and I would agree with that, Tim, and I would like to make a motion that the council requests that that group that met take into consideration what you just said and also try to develop a plan including prioritizing details that completes this project by the end of the 2022 construction season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7996.878s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, and I completely hear that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7998.618s">[Bears]</a>: And I just want to make the request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8001.919s">[Bears]</a>: Because this is such a large amount of priority roadway in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8005.72s">[Bears]</a>: And a lot of folks have had, you know, I hear about it all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8009.821s">[Bears]</a>: And I agree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8011.961s">[Bears]</a>: I hope we can all get it done as quickly as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8013.741s">[Bears]</a>: And I hope maybe we can come to some sort of compromise that that can allow that to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8018.542s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9210.372s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9211.093s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Bearst.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9213.694s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9214.535s">[Bears]</a>: I'd just like to make an amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9216.356s">[Bears]</a>: Last time we were discussing historic districts,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9218.966s">[Bears]</a>: One of the issues was we don't have a timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9221.328s">[Bears]</a>: We don't have a plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9221.969s">[Bears]</a>: We don't have a list of any potential districts in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9224.371s">[Bears]</a>: So I'd like an amendment to make an amendment asking the historic district commission to provide a timeline for the creation of a plan outlining potential historic districts across the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10197.319s">[Bears]</a>: I believe it's denied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11350.354s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11351.935s">[Bears]</a>: And I don't want to repeat the comments of my fellow Councilors and I promise I won't go on for too long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11357.339s">[Bears]</a>: But I do think it might behoove us also to think even bigger about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11361.802s">[Bears]</a>: I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11363.01s">[Bears]</a>: very likely there will be a 6G and a 7G.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11366.392s">[Bears]</a>: We also have issues with the broadband wired lines in the city right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11371.256s">[Bears]</a>: And I know I brought this up at the beginning of this term in January, 2020, but looking into municipal broadband, is it possible for the city to be in ownership of these devices and in that way control the placement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11383.485s">[Bears]</a>: I just wanna put that idea out there for any future meetings, thinking outside the box of different ways that we could address the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11391.53s">[Bears]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=501.349s">[Bears]</a>: I just want to second what everyone said and also just add that as a Mustang, as a graduate of Medford High School, it's just great that you made the school and the city so proud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=511.713s">[Bears]</a>: And I hope we'll be able to congratulate you for something else again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=515.194s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2149.264s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you Mr. President and I want to thank Councilor Marks for such a detailed presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2154.471s">[Bears]</a>: I think it's incredibly important that massive multinational corporations be accountable to our local governance and not just allowed to run free and do whatever they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2163.944s">[Bears]</a>: And I also agree that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2165.573s">[Bears]</a>: This process has been reflective of an issue with the city around notification and making sure that residents are involved and engage the decisions that we're making.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2171.699s">[Bears]</a>: So I think those changes are welcome and I would also agree with the motions asking our I mean it's ridiculous that the telecommunications act doesn't factor in health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2180.708s">[Bears]</a>: That's that's nuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2182.07s">[Bears]</a>: So I think we need that state and federal action as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2185.712s">[Bears]</a>: Just one thing I wanted to bring up and add to the conversation is that the small cell approach to 5G is not the only approach that the large corporations are using.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2195.038s">[Bears]</a>: AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint are looking at different ways of deploying this technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2200.702s">[Bears]</a>: As far as I'm aware, only Verizon right now is moving ahead with installing small cells as the way that this network would work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2206.646s">[Bears]</a>: So I'd really also like to get some<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2210.27s">[Bears]</a>: Clarification about how that deployment might work differently in a policy or an ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2217.295s">[Bears]</a>: Obviously the small cells, that's been the focus of discussion because that's what Verizon's bringing in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2222.7s">[Bears]</a>: But there's definitely, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint are talking about many fewer antennas that are longer range.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2230.205s">[Bears]</a>: And I'd like to make sure that any policy that we implement or any research that we bring up factors in different ways that potentially 5G may be deployed by these companies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5904.63s">[Bears]</a>: Well, I was hoping a second, but Councilor Knight beat me to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5907.551s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5908.231s">[Bears]</a>: And I was also hoping to catch some of the people leaving the room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5912.452s">[Bears]</a>: If you know me, and this may speak strangely to my character, but two of my favorite things in the world are the post office and the census.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5920.594s">[Bears]</a>: And I just,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5922.515s">[Bears]</a>: to the people watching can't implore you enough to fill out your census form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5928.017s">[Bears]</a>: It means we've done a census since 1800.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5931.018s">[Bears]</a>: It's one of the biggest things we do every 10 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5932.979s">[Bears]</a>: It's one of the biggest non-wartime mobilizations of people by the government that we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5939.901s">[Bears]</a>: And it goes into so much more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5942.402s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, it goes into everything that Councilor Scarpelli said, which is incredibly important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5945.819s">[Bears]</a>: It's also the foundation of basically all the statistics and facts that we have on the population of this country, most of the social science research that's done at the local, state, and federal level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5956.286s">[Bears]</a>: And you may not have voted for me for this, but I'm incredibly passionate about the census, and I'd love to talk to Director Osborne about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5964.191s">[Bears]</a>: So I just want to remind everyone that April 1st is Census Day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5970.376s">[Bears]</a>: Have your forms in by April 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6150.768s">[Bears]</a>: working for the city is an immense public service, and I thank Carol.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6443.808s">[Bears]</a>: I just want to add that if I'm on Facebook, Medford Square, Medford Politics, whichever group it might be, this might be the issue I see most.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6451.734s">[Bears]</a>: You know, there's things that come and go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6452.995s">[Bears]</a>: This is a consistent issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6454.416s">[Bears]</a>: And we need to address it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6456.978s">[Bears]</a>: We need our state delegation to address it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6459.4s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6568.59s">[Bears]</a>: The other aspect of this, Councilor Caraviello, you made me think of it, is, you know, we've been talking about behavioral health and substance use disorder, and there's commission being proposed currently, and I think it might be worth, and I won't offer this as an amendment, I'll offer this as just a point of information, but I think it might be worth considering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6587.623s">[Bears]</a>: what we could do around providing additional literature around addiction and substance use disorders, which I think we know, and I personally know of people in my life who are drinking nips because they have a substance use disorder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6661.214s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6662.895s">[Bears]</a>: I got a message this week from a Medford resident who crosses regularly at the crosswalk that if I stood up I might be able to see from the window right here and it is pretty faded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6674.365s">[Bears]</a>: It's you know this can be a pretty high speed area here on City Hall Mall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6678.169s">[Bears]</a>: There's the merging traffic and then they're going back out and Harbour Vanguard's pretty high traffic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6683.213s">[Bears]</a>: City Hall can be pretty high traffic and I just think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6686.184s">[Bears]</a>: It's important for that crosswalk to be visible for drivers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6689.546s">[Bears]</a>: And I will also talk to the DPW about it myself as well this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=7538.724s">[Bears]</a>: Very quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=7539.504s">[Bears]</a>: I just wanted to say I think the legal counsel issue is incredibly important and also that we get official city emails.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=7546.106s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1053.368s">[Bears]</a>: It was Councilor Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1057.972s">[Bears]</a>: I thought Councilor Bears had the second, but we said it at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1124.551s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1125.571s">[Bears]</a>: I'm fine with that, as long as it's within the control of the business, as long as the property owner isn't the one who controls the light switch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1134.114s">[Bears]</a>: We're just having a little bit of feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1135.575s">[Bears]</a>: I think there were too many mics turned on, so that's directed to you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1140.617s">[Bears]</a>: I think we're fine now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1141.497s">[Bears]</a>: It looks like they're off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1142.897s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, we're fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1143.698s">[Bears]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1797.978s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1799.019s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Marks and the petitioner answered my question, so I'm all set.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1802.361s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1994.29s">[Bears]</a>: Motion to take 2562 off the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2318.105s">[Bears]</a>: I think it's the south elevation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2326.134s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, I think it's the one that was approved by Wright faces the building that Margarita's used to be in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2581.228s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2582.089s">[Bears]</a>: Through you to the petitioner, will these illuminated signs be shut off at 10 p.m.?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2644.834s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2904.009s">[Bears]</a>: Is it 544?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3474.34s">[Bears]</a>: I think it's on the other side of the intersection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3476.141s">[Bears]</a>: I might be wrong, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4816.386s">[Bears]</a>: You're good to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4817.367s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4817.807s">[Bears]</a>: Do we have the city engineer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4823.35s">[Bears]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4826.311s">[Bears]</a>: I guess then just to the petitioners, when will this construction start?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4832.335s">[Bears]</a>: Is this next spring?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4833.336s">[Bears]</a>: Is it this fall?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4855.529s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4855.949s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4856.35s">[Bears]</a>: And I mean, my question for the engineer would be why, why are there 18 now conditions, but he's not here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4862.134s">[Bears]</a>: So that's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4970.592s">[Bears]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4977.195s">[Bears]</a>: As amended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5007.511s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. President, while we're under suspension, can we move to take communications from the mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5290.278s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5292.919s">[Bears]</a>: I didn't have my hand up yet, but I was going to put it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5298.462s">[Bears]</a>: We've had a lot of discussion about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5300.263s">[Bears]</a>: We went on a site visit yesterday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5301.804s">[Bears]</a>: I think the discussion in our committee of the whole Allen site showed us that we are really close here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5308.047s">[Bears]</a>: I think that the property owner<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5311.946s">[Bears]</a>: and the members of the historic commission, the historic district commission are close, and I think we should encourage that compromise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5318.409s">[Bears]</a>: But I also think that what's before us tonight is the question of whether 16 Foster Court and the 200-year-old structure on the lot warrants a historic district designation, and I think from the evidence we've been shown, it absolutely does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5330.654s">[Bears]</a>: I'm heartened by the efforts of the property owner to reach compromise, and now, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5337.697s">[Bears]</a>: I'm concerned that if we don't approve the district that the compromise won't be reached and one of the last pieces of the shipbuilding history of our city, which as we know is an important part of our city's history, will be demolished on October 9th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5352.509s">[Bears]</a>: Now that the community process is underway, and now that it's clear that the developer and the Historical Commission and the Historic District Commission are near to a good faith compromise, I think we should approve the district, ensuring that the community process can continue without the threat of demolition hanging over the discussions and the goal of compromise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5369.551s">[Bears]</a>: I think 16 Foster Court clearly deserves the historic designation, regardless of the compromise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5375.335s">[Bears]</a>: I'm hopeful that it will keep the facade of the building and that we can really celebrate the shipbuilding history of the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5384.222s">[Bears]</a>: But that designation certainly would not preclude moving forward with development, and I think all parties involved are ready to have that discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5391.167s">[Bears]</a>: So I think we should advance this, but I welcome hearing from my other Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5397.292s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5401.962s">[Bears]</a>: Are you not making a motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5403.684s">[Bears]</a>: Nope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5761.611s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5762.973s">[Bears]</a>: And thank you for your presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5766.713s">[Bears]</a>: So I guess it seems like if there's a compromise, you wouldn't want the district to be in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5772.234s">[Bears]</a>: And I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5773.994s">[Bears]</a>: I was just wondering, would the bench and the plaque that was mentioned earlier be a part of this as well?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5779.095s">[Bears]</a>: I really like the idea of taking the timbers that can't be obviously saved and used in the structure and building a bench out of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5790.217s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5790.917s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Ari.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6084.653s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President, and I want to echo Councilor Marks and my colleagues' comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6089.214s">[Bears]</a>: And I also want to say that I think this shows the efficacy of the demo delay and the potential historic district as a tool to ensure that we can have a negotiation and reach a compromise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6098.897s">[Bears]</a>: I think in many cases in this community with developers, we don't really have much community leverage, and in this case we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6106.819s">[Bears]</a>: And I think it's allowed us to meet all of the different pieces of this, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6111.963s">[Bears]</a>: It's allowed us to really make sure that development can happen, that housing units can be built, which I think we all agree that, you know, in an apartment district, it makes sense to have, on a lot of that size, it makes sense to have units, while also maintaining historical preservation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6125.833s">[Bears]</a>: So I just want to say I think it actually shows that, you know, if we didn't have demo delay and we didn't have this historic district proposal, we would just,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6134.759s">[Bears]</a>: have another building of apartments and not something that preserves and kind of highlights the history of shipbuilding in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6141.964s">[Bears]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6387.576s">[Bears]</a>: Point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6390.746s">[Bears]</a>: Would the second reading be able to be published on October 7th?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6395.128s">[Bears]</a>: What is the print deadline for the Medford transcript?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6398.41s">[Bears]</a>: Why does it have to be in the transcript?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6399.831s">[Bears]</a>: The Globe runs every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6563.182s">[Bears]</a>: Point of information, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6567.203s">[Bears]</a>: I just got a message from Ryan Hayward that they have approved the cost to run it in the Herald or Globe if needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6572.526s">[Bears]</a>: So I'm comfortable tabling until the 6th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6669.637s">[Bears]</a>: I second Councilor Knight's motion to table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6861.219s">[Bears]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6863.96s">[Bears]</a>: I'd move to take all communications from the mayor out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6869.501s">[Bears]</a>: No, I meant all of them, but it's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7019.465s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7020.766s">[Bears]</a>: I'm incredibly glad to see this item before the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7023.287s">[Bears]</a>: I think charter reviews are long overdue in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7025.829s">[Bears]</a>: I think this charter was last reviewed before I was born.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7028.271s">[Bears]</a>: And empowering this council and ensuring greater representation and diversity on the council are one of the many ways I hope, one of the many changes I hope the Charter Commission would explore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7038.717s">[Bears]</a>: I do have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7040.439s">[Bears]</a>: I'm not sure if a representative of the city administration will be able to answer it or who we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7046.242s">[Bears]</a>: We have Jackie Peeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7047.863s">[Bears]</a>: I'm not sure if Jackie has this information off the top of her head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7051.004s">[Bears]</a>: And maybe my colleagues, I'm especially thinking Councilor Knight might have the answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7056.606s">[Bears]</a>: If this were approved tonight, would it be disposed of by the legislature at the end of this session in December?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7063.009s">[Bears]</a>: And would a new home rule petition have to be sent after the new general court session begins in January?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7085.188s">[Bears]</a>: I think Councilor Knight might have said yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7123.119s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I would be happy to ask the solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7125.6s">[Bears]</a>: I'll ask on my own, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7898.231s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. President, motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7904.201s">[Bears]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8083.686s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8085.027s">[Bears]</a>: And I hear what people are saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8086.189s">[Bears]</a>: I just think this is the part where it's not, we're not, the city of Benford is not focused on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8090.573s">[Bears]</a>: This is, we're asking the permission from the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8092.755s">[Bears]</a>: We've known how long it can take on a variety of home rule petitions that this council has sent in the past that have never been heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8098.8s">[Bears]</a>: I think we are advantaged by sending it sooner rather than later, trying to get the legislature to move on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8105.705s">[Bears]</a>: Because I think if we send it, I'll vote for it now, I'll vote for it in January, I'll vote for it whenever it's on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8112.15s">[Bears]</a>: But if we send it in January, it could be the next January before they act on it, or they may never act on it at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8118.575s">[Bears]</a>: So I just think if we're talking about time, this is the part of the process where it's not,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8125.649s">[Bears]</a>: in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8126.77s">[Bears]</a>: It's in the general court asking for the home rule petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8131.412s">[Bears]</a>: So I just think getting it up there sooner rather than later to try to move it along, it doesn't mean that this council can't focus on the many other issues that we have at hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8141.436s">[Bears]</a>: So that's just where I'm at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8143.838s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8190.983s">[Bears]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8191.183s">[Bears]</a>: Well, Mr. President, if I may.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8194.606s">[Bears]</a>: And I think that that's kind of the point I'm trying to make, is let's send it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8197.327s">[Bears]</a>: If they approve it, they approve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8198.767s">[Bears]</a>: If we send it up now in this session, and if not, we're back in January, and then they can approve it in the new session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8204.409s">[Bears]</a>: I just think we know exactly how difficult it is for the municipalities, whether it's Medford or most other municipalities, to get a home rule petition passed through the legislature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8214.052s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8819.967s">[Bears]</a>: And if I may, we received a communication from- Mr. President, if I may just quickly say that I had prior, in the past I had refused myself from brewery business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8831.775s">[Bears]</a>: I mentioned this at a committee of the whole, but I think I should mention it in full council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8835.357s">[Bears]</a>: That I consulted with the ethics commission and both myself and my family members divested ourselves from the Medford Brewing Company, allowing me to participate in discussions regarding this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8844.863s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9306.745s">[Bears]</a>: Point of information, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9310.66s">[Bears]</a>: Just the seven barrels is actually the size of the brewing system, not the amount of beer produced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9315.884s">[Bears]</a>: So I think, I don't know who the enforcement authority would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9318.786s">[Bears]</a>: I think that we could appoint multiple people who would otherwise be approving a license to review to make sure that it is a seven barrel system or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9493.584s">[Bears]</a>: Uncle Adam does, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9494.504s">[Bears]</a>: You can count me as an Uncle Zach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9517.077s">[Bears]</a>: Second the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9837.426s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Marks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9838.546s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9839.427s">[Bears]</a>: Oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9906.151s">[Bears]</a>: I want to echo the thanks of my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9909.092s">[Bears]</a>: And if Councilor Knight is amenable, could we also amend this motion to also be a motion to table?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9915.276s">[Bears]</a>: So we only have to take one roll call vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9918.738s">[Bears]</a>: All good?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9921.78s">[Bears]</a>: Whichever date you prefer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9925.082s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9937.409s">[Bears]</a>: I was just referring to the CAC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9951.341s">[Bears]</a>: Oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9951.821s">[Bears]</a>: I was saying that if we could make a motion to amend amendment to Councilor Knight's motion so that we table it to a date certain so we only have to take one roll call vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9960.929s">[Bears]</a>: And that's just for the CAC, not for the zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10044.07s">[Bears]</a>: As an amendment to Councilor Knight's motion to request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10062.412s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10062.893s">[Bears]</a>: And if required, I'd happy to make further amendment to waive the reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10070.758s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know if that's required or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10074.16s">[Bears]</a>: You didn't read the 10 page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10154.858s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, the CAC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10155.498s">[Bears]</a>: The CAC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10172.164s">[Bears]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10177.788s">[Bears]</a>: As amended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10208.216s">[Bears]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10306.998s">[Bears]</a>: Did we already do in favor and opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10313.742s">[Bears]</a>: Did we already do the in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10365.689s">[Bears]</a>: May our ancestors of the temperance movement forgive us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10515.889s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10517.229s">[Bears]</a>: I strongly support the resolution and hope we can move forward quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10522.471s">[Bears]</a>: And I would just ask, it's not a motion or an amendment, just ask that none of these meetings supersede any committee of the whole meetings on the same proposed ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10674.969s">[Bears]</a>: Second and move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11769.875s">[Bears]</a>: a point of information, point of information, point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11793.215s">[Bears]</a>: Just a clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11794.656s">[Bears]</a>: Would that amendment be instead of conducting a new audit,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11798.76s">[Bears]</a>: Strike and replace, got it, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11801.622s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11972.828s">[Bears]</a>: I wouldn't mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11974.088s">[Bears]</a>: I don't see any harm in just asking for both up front.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11977.409s">[Bears]</a>: I'd like both if people are open to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11994.627s">[Bears]</a>: I just don't see any difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11996.448s">[Bears]</a>: If it's a lot, I'd like more time to read it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12003.231s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, an amendment to receive both the independent audit and the monthly city audits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12632.674s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President, and I send my condolences to the Goloni family as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12637.476s">[Bears]</a>: If my council colleagues would be open to it, I'd like to propose a B paper to also send our deep and sincere condolences to the family of Catherine Gorman Rodriguez, who is the mother of our city's chief of staff, Dave Rodriguez, sister of former school committee member Aaron DeBenedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12655.582s">[Bears]</a>: And I would move that as a B paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12659.164s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13010.223s">[Bears]</a>: 2-0-- I move to withdraw, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13356.73s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13360.083s">[Bears]</a>: I do think that if the school committee passed a resolution asking us for a report on something, we might have an issue with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13367.811s">[Bears]</a>: So I just want to put that out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13369.393s">[Bears]</a>: But in terms of the framing on the actual issue, I definitely think that equity in access to attending remote learning is a concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13378.667s">[Bears]</a>: And it's just the framing, the framing of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13382.588s">[Bears]</a>: Address truancy, hire truancy often, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13384.889s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, I don't know if that really addresses the scope of how we address the problem of equity and access here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13390.231s">[Bears]</a>: Because I think some of it, sure, some of it could be a family problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13392.892s">[Bears]</a>: Some of it could be technological.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13394.412s">[Bears]</a>: Some of it could be logistical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13397.233s">[Bears]</a>: So I understand the concern, and I hear the concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13402.475s">[Bears]</a>: The framing just doesn't feel right to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13404.015s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13961.721s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13962.522s">[Bears]</a>: I don't want to beat a dead horse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13963.604s">[Bears]</a>: I think Councilor Marks and Councilor Caraviello made a lot of good points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13968.631s">[Bears]</a>: If it was not 11 p.m., I might be a little more angry because I think we literally saw the city clerk<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13976.174s">[Bears]</a>: physically change and feel the stress of working hundreds of hours in a very short amount of time to make an election work that we've never seen before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13984.418s">[Bears]</a>: And to be honest, the city clerk has been asking for this for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13987.579s">[Bears]</a>: For years he's been asking for this to be in the budget from the mayor's office, and this man, the previous mayor, it just hasn't gotten in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13993.362s">[Bears]</a>: They haven't put it in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13994.342s">[Bears]</a>: So it's not like we didn't see this coming down the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13997.924s">[Bears]</a>: Early voting, 10 days of early voting, is enshrined in law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14001.545s">[Bears]</a>: from now until forever for primary and the general election, so that's there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14007.426s">[Bears]</a>: Now we're gonna have mail ballots, maybe for a long time, maybe that'll be enshrined into law too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14012.907s">[Bears]</a>: There's a ballot question, we might have ranked choice voting, which might also add to the elections plate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14018.288s">[Bears]</a>: And just to make the point, this city clerk has put on four, by November, he will have put on four major elections in 12 months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14026.99s">[Bears]</a>: The municipal election, the presidential primary, the state and federal primary,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14031.151s">[Bears]</a>: and the general election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14032.031s">[Bears]</a>: Four elections in 12 months without an elections coordinator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14034.512s">[Bears]</a>: So I'm a little angry that this hasn't been addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14038.794s">[Bears]</a>: I'm a little angry that the clerk was kind of hung out to dry when he's been asking for this to be addressed for years and it hasn't been done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14045.636s">[Bears]</a>: So let's do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14049.497s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know what else to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14050.497s">[Bears]</a>: It needs to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14052.178s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14204.73s">[Bears]</a>: just as if I may, and not to step on your toes, I know for a fact that the clerk has made these asks directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14211.274s">[Bears]</a>: It's not about meeting and asking what they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14212.975s">[Bears]</a>: The needs have been outlined, the asks have been made, and they are not being answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14216.898s">[Bears]</a>: So it's just very frustrating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14804.309s">[Bears]</a>: What's the motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14804.709s">[Bears]</a>: The letter to the secretary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14813.356s">[Bears]</a>: We're already voting yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15064.353s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15065.374s">[Bears]</a>: If Councilor Marks wouldn't mind an amendment as well, just to add the diversity director to that committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15158.206s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15159.867s">[Bears]</a>: I think I saw on Councilor Morell posted today that the city is around 71.2% or 71.8% response rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15172.137s">[Bears]</a>: That's 28% short of where we need to be in terms of having a full count in this 2020 census.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15179.683s">[Bears]</a>: We are eight days away from the end of the census now that the Trump administration has shortened the time that the census will occur.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15188.73s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, to be completely honest, talking to census experts, there's a deep concern that this entire census process will be flawed, but given that it's entirely possible that it will be certified and be the official result, the goal of this is to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15204.418s">[Bears]</a>: ask the city administration, say we were at 72 or 75 or 80%, and I'm leaving that up to them, what would the impact of that low response rate be in terms of any federal funding, state funding, and other ways that we are bound by the census in the different funding streams that we have for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15226.391s">[Bears]</a>: So that's the intent here, and I would move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15277.062s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15279.363s">[Bears]</a>: So Rivers Edge Drive over in the eastern most part of the city, some of it is in pretty good condition, some of it is in less than ideal condition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15289.725s">[Bears]</a>: And really this is just an intent to get an update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15291.866s">[Bears]</a>: I have been informed that our neighbors in Malden do have, I believe, some funding to redo what they're calling<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15300.188s">[Bears]</a>: commercial street, which then turns into River's Edge Drive here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15303.69s">[Bears]</a>: So I just want an update to see if there's anything in the works to repave or repaint or in any way improve the condition of River's Edge Drive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15571.547s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15572.807s">[Bears]</a>: And I would just add two quick things, which is, number one, that the pandemic and the mental health effects associated with the pandemic and the pandemic restrictions are making this problem worse, and that I think that this is incredibly apt during Recovery Awareness Month that we do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15587.819s">[Bears]</a>: So I have friends who deal with substance use disorder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15591.041s">[Bears]</a>: I have some friends who've had a very hard time through COVID-19 and who would appreciate a meeting nearby that they could get to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15597.947s">[Bears]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15830.558s">[Bears]</a>: Motion to get the President a computer charger.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15852.843s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15915.409s">[Bears]</a>: Motion to take 20-540 off the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15919.781s">[Bears]</a>: Second the motion, move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15926.987s">[Bears]</a>: Take paper 20-540 off the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15940.838s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16176.295s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16219.657s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16271.269s">[Bears]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=132.696s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=246.801s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=247.361s">[Bears]</a>: Happy birthday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=430.48s">[Bears]</a>: 20-476.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=431.601s">[Bears]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=4791.67s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you, Mary Ann.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=4795.832s">[Bears]</a>: I think you've had an incredibly difficult job over these past several months, keeping people alive, keeping people safe and healthy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=4802.715s">[Bears]</a>: And now, as it drags on, as the serious situation drags on, you have the job of trying to keep people in our community, keeping them safe from themselves, to an extent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=4813.579s">[Bears]</a>: We all want things to go back to normal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=4815.981s">[Bears]</a>: We all want things to be the way they were before, but we are where we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=4820.384s">[Bears]</a>: So I just have a couple questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=4824.687s">[Bears]</a>: You mentioned that we've been in the yellow for over a month, that our positivity<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=4830.165s">[Bears]</a>: You know, we have positive tests at some point in the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=4835.729s">[Bears]</a>: And, you know, we've seen over the past two weeks in Massachusetts, a 65% increase in COVID cases, positive cases over the past two weeks in Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=4844.637s">[Bears]</a>: And the governor today was talking about a winter surge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=4849.02s">[Bears]</a>: So it's not the time to let our guard down at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=4851.642s">[Bears]</a>: We have to be vigilant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=4852.583s">[Bears]</a>: We need to be careful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=4853.884s">[Bears]</a>: We shouldn't be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=4855.325s">[Bears]</a>: pushing things faster than they should go, as recommended by our public health experts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=4859.247s">[Bears]</a>: I was just wondering, Marianne, given those statistics and given what the governor was talking about today, what are the plans or what are the thoughts around if cases continue to go up over the next couple months?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5066.294s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5068.475s">[Bears]</a>: And I mean, I don't think anyone needs to hear it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5071.457s">[Bears]</a>: I think we've all heard it ad nauseum over the past five days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5074.719s">[Bears]</a>: But we have the best example of someone or some group not being vigilant when we have someone who's getting tested every day, catching this coronavirus and super spreading it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5085.365s">[Bears]</a>: So we just need to be careful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5087.046s">[Bears]</a>: If the President of the United States is vulnerable, I think we all are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5091.588s">[Bears]</a>: One other question, you mentioned it a little bit in the positivity rate, Mary Ann, and I was reading about this too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5098.352s">[Bears]</a>: The state's calculating the positivity rate based on the number of tests, but the old measure was actually on the number of people tested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5104.976s">[Bears]</a>: Were you saying that the, you know, you said that because there's so many tests at Tufts that our positivity rate was like .36, but if we based it on the number of people being tested, what did you say that number was again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5995.147s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5999.833s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7769.722s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7793.38s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. President, while we're under suspension, motion to take 20-541.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7800.416s">[Bears]</a>: While we're under suspension, motion to take paper 20-541.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7802.637s">[Bears]</a>: 20-541.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7821.621s">[Bears]</a>: It's the one under communications from the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7825.062s">[Bears]</a>: It's the historic district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7949.809s">[Bears]</a>: To waive the reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8022.219s">[Bears]</a>: I'd like to make a motion to sever the First Amendment 1 and the Second Amendment 2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8112.316s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8115.579s">[Bears]</a>: Are we voting on each one of these separately?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8130.914s">[Bears]</a>: I think the first amendment updates the language in the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8134.076s">[Bears]</a>: The second amendment would add a historic district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8137.659s">[Bears]</a>: Regardless of the vote on the specific historic district, I think it is worth updating the language in the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8144.184s">[Bears]</a>: So that's why I would have them be two separate votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8160.054s">[Bears]</a>: I don't have a copy of that in front of me, but I'd be happy to take a look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8192.655s">[Bears]</a>: Well, it's, I don't want to speak to the intent of the mayor and proposing this, but there's two separate amendments dealing with two separate issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8198.359s">[Bears]</a>: And I think we should vote on them separately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8257.942s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8260.383s">[Bears]</a>: I'm looking at the ordinance now the 4851 a Amendment one would alter the structure To make it clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8269.432s">[Bears]</a>: I think to the reader what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8272.174s">[Bears]</a>: 4851 a is saying so that's why I would stand by my motion to sever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8315.94s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think it necessarily does that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8338.941s">[Bears]</a>: No, I think we're going to change bounded respectively to bounded as respectively shown on the map entitled or the map.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8345.825s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8351.128s">[Bears]</a>: Let's say the map reflecting the titles of the historic districts listed below.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8370.434s">[Bears]</a>: Sure, it seems like there's a slight discrepancy in the length.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8373.235s">[Bears]</a>: Basically, amendment one adjusts the paragraph formatting of section 4851 subsection A to better reflect the number of historic districts and show it in a clear list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8387.339s">[Bears]</a>: It seems that the language bounded as respectively shown on the map is not translated over to this amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8396.925s">[Bears]</a>: So I would instead amend the language to say, instead of bounded respectively, to say bounded as respectively shown on the maps for the districts listed below.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8433.343s">[Bears]</a>: I believe Councilor Knight is the one who had an issue with the language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8566.132s">[Bears]</a>: I've withdrawn the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8834.375s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8836.737s">[Bears]</a>: Could we hear from Mr. Bader?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9890.912s">[Bears]</a>: Point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9927.28s">[Bears]</a>: And so that was when this was first voted on the first time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9930.561s">[Bears]</a>: That's what you're referring to as the 3, 0.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10612.366s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10614.047s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, one other expert opinion we consulted was the building commissioner, Mr. Moki, and he did not mandate that the building be demolished.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10621.489s">[Bears]</a>: So I just think we need to consider the variety of opinions that we've heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10627.711s">[Bears]</a>: You know, I think it seems everyone's in agreement that a process needs to be developed or modified in the future around historic districts and demolition delay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10638.495s">[Bears]</a>: That's not the paper before us tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10642.825s">[Bears]</a>: It's not anything we do on that is not going to address what we've gotten up to this point on this specific issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10648.127s">[Bears]</a>: It seems to me that when we were at our Committee of the Whole meeting a couple weeks ago, that we felt okay about a kind of tentative compromise that was put in place that would lead to members of, well, at that point, I guess, members of our Historical Commission and members of our Historical District Commission<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10669.693s">[Bears]</a>: Negotiating in faith with the property owner to come to a reasonable agreement around some element of preservation of this property or on this property that would allow the property owner to develop the type of structure that they want to develop while maintaining the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10687.398s">[Bears]</a>: some element of the historical significance of that property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10691.299s">[Bears]</a>: That's what we're debating tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10692.759s">[Bears]</a>: That's what we're discussing tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10694.6s">[Bears]</a>: It seems to me that we have not yet reached the good faith compromise we wanted to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10700.381s">[Bears]</a>: I think one of those reasons, again, is the timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10703.342s">[Bears]</a>: The 17 meetings where this was on an agenda for the historical commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10707.323s">[Bears]</a>: That was not, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10740.663s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. President, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10742.184s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, I would expect someone making a multi-hundred thousand dollar investment with the potential of a multi-million dollar profit would be paying attention to things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10759.958s">[Bears]</a>: That's not what I said, so I think anyone in the city knows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10764.281s">[Bears]</a>: how much this building was purchased for as it's public information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10767.322s">[Bears]</a>: And anyone knows that if we're building multiple units for sale on that property, that it would also be worth millions of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10774.283s">[Bears]</a>: I think that's reflective of the market conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10777.224s">[Bears]</a>: In any case, what we're voting on is the specific historic nature of this district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10783.265s">[Bears]</a>: And I think we're all in agreement that there's a good faith compromise that needs to come out of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10787.986s">[Bears]</a>: The timeline has been shrunk, and people can point fingers wherever they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10791.967s">[Bears]</a>: The timeline is what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10793.847s">[Bears]</a>: 10 days to produce a rendering clearly wasn't sufficient to produce a rendering that people feel comfortable with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10798.45s">[Bears]</a>: I think we need to vote for this tonight and allow the discussions and compromise to continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10803.212s">[Bears]</a>: That's what needs to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10805.233s">[Bears]</a>: Otherwise, here we are, October 6, demo delays in two days, building gets knocked down, and then where are we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10811.857s">[Bears]</a>: Maybe we don't even get a plank and a bench.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10813.518s">[Bears]</a>: I hope we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10815.999s">[Bears]</a>: We don't have so many tools in our toolbox.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10819.02s">[Bears]</a>: This has been waited out for 18 months with one of the tools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10821.981s">[Bears]</a>: The other tool of the historic district is what's left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10826.382s">[Bears]</a>: I think we should make sure that we continue to have the power to make sure that this compromise happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10832.024s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10918.198s">[Bears]</a>: Do we know that a letter was ever sent to the historic district commission about this issue, that they were notified that they should be embarking on this apparent journey to identify single district properties?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10930.001s">[Bears]</a>: Point of information, the chairman was present at the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10932.782s">[Bears]</a>: Point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11911.818s">[Bears]</a>: Just a couple quick questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11916.001s">[Bears]</a>: Were you aware, Mr. Goldschneider, that this property was subject to review by the Historical Commission around demolition delay in July 2019?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11930.304s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, and this effort to work on the local historic district that you brought up from July 2019, was that on public meeting minutes that the public had access to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11942.15s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11945.191s">[Bears]</a>: Well, I mean, the answer is yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11948.072s">[Bears]</a>: Were you checking the minutes of the commission because you knew that your property was under their review?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11978.91s">[Bears]</a>: First off, what you heard and what they said might be two different things, but you just said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11985.134s">[Bears]</a>: You just said, Mr. Goldschneider, you just said that you knew it was subject to their review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11991.177s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12397.515s">[Bears]</a>: Just a few questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12400.517s">[Bears]</a>: Is this the end all be all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12401.697s">[Bears]</a>: Is this proposed design that you've rendered and we've seen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12405.179s">[Bears]</a>: Is that the final design?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12449.724s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, no, I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12451.266s">[Bears]</a>: I'm saying, you know, you're saying it's not a final, that the rendering is not final.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12454.63s">[Bears]</a>: There could be changes or adjustments to it, potentially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12472.199s">[Bears]</a>: Got it, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12474.119s">[Bears]</a>: And I guess my next question would be, you know, if the single house historic district is not approved tonight, are you planning to, when would demolition commence?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12495.864s">[Bears]</a>: TBD.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12497.064s">[Bears]</a>: So I mean, I'm just saying, you know, we're all talking about the timeline here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12501.345s">[Bears]</a>: clearly more discussions need to be had for all parties involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12505.906s">[Bears]</a>: So we have kind of a tentative, a non-legally binding agreement out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12515.769s">[Bears]</a>: Could part of fulfilling that be not demolishing it on Friday?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12521.01s">[Bears]</a>: I can't speak for Ari on that, but I just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12567.119s">[Bears]</a>: Well, it's a community process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12569.561s">[Bears]</a>: But again, Ari, my question stands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12571.723s">[Bears]</a>: I know Adam can't answer it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12572.704s">[Bears]</a>: I'm wondering if you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12578.769s">[Bears]</a>: The question is, you know, there's a tentative agreement out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12582.832s">[Bears]</a>: It's not a legally binding agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12584.794s">[Bears]</a>: Could part of that be we won't demolish it on Friday, or we'll give another 10 days for further discussion before we demolish the structure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12620.302s">[Bears]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12621.043s">[Bears]</a>: Just my question is, does TBD mean that the building, the structure may be demolished before the community development board meetings or the site plan review process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12647.385s">[Bears]</a>: Well, it seems here that the stakeholders involved are concerned that if you knock down the building prior to having some sort of agreement on what the future is around preservation on the property, then there may not be an agreement at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12664.229s">[Bears]</a>: What's, you know, the leverage here is that, you know, you can't knock down your property until we come to an agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12669.371s">[Bears]</a>: If that leverage disappears, then you could knock down the property and not come to an agreement, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12679.357s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12692.726s">[Bears]</a>: I was just wondering if we could, you know, there's a lot of gentleman's agreements going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12696.068s">[Bears]</a>: I feel like, you know, it doesn't really preclude anything or hasn't up to this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12700.347s">[Bears]</a>: I'm fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12700.727s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. President, I move approval on this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12886.704s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, again, process, process, process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12889.326s">[Bears]</a>: We're hearing about process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12890.407s">[Bears]</a>: I agree we need to update and create a new process around the issue of historic preservation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12894.749s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think anyone disagrees with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12896.651s">[Bears]</a>: Question before us tonight is does 16 Foster Court deserve historic status?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12901.634s">[Bears]</a>: I believe the answer is yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12903.435s">[Bears]</a>: We can say it's about something else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12905.236s">[Bears]</a>: We can say it's about the corner office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12906.858s">[Bears]</a>: We can say it's about boards and commissions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12909.239s">[Bears]</a>: That's not the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12910.66s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12992.027s">[Bears]</a>: Motion to revert to the regular order of business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12994.307s">[Bears]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13663.375s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you for reading that whole thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13669.15s">[Bears]</a>: Snow shoveling is a perennial issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13670.711s">[Bears]</a>: It's a seasonal issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13671.811s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to try to avoid bad wordplay and puns from here on out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13675.813s">[Bears]</a>: But it's a major accessibility issue in our community for people with disabilities and for folks who, I mean, we just heard from Councilor, Vice President Caraviello, you know, people who might be in a mobility assistance device.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13690.54s">[Bears]</a>: who already are having trouble getting around our city when there's not snow and ice everywhere, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13695.784s">[Bears]</a>: So, you know, we have a current ordinance around snow shoveling and maintenance of our sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13702.528s">[Bears]</a>: I think it's been a discussion of this council in the past and of the previous city administrations that that ordinance should be updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13710.573s">[Bears]</a>: It's insufficient in certain places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13713.455s">[Bears]</a>: One example is that it's the occupant or tenant of a property who will be responsible for removal of snow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13718.496s">[Bears]</a>: City doesn't necessarily have a record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13720.897s">[Bears]</a>: We have a very good record of who owns property in this community, not necessarily occupants and tenants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13728.079s">[Bears]</a>: And I think Councilor Marks actually noted that several hours ago now in our committee of the whole on the donation bin ordinance, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13736.882s">[Bears]</a>: We know who's on the property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13738.322s">[Bears]</a>: We might not know every person who's putting up a bin in the same way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13742.423s">[Bears]</a>: at least at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13744.424s">[Bears]</a>: There's definitely a few issues with the, you know, both of the existing ordinance that the existing ordinance doesn't address and that I'm hoping we can iron out in a future subcommittee meeting on the proposed ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13755.167s">[Bears]</a>: One is the issue of corners and the city plow ends where the city may, you know, put some snow on a sidewalk or on a corridor or a private plow operator may do the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13768.331s">[Bears]</a>: Looking at some sort of exemption or alternate plan for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13771.952s">[Bears]</a>: the elderly and people with disabilities who may be property owners but may also not be able to remove snow and ice on their own or may not have access to the resources to pay someone to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13782.483s">[Bears]</a>: And someone emailed me after this was on the agenda that the plows, the faster the plows go, the more snow gets thrown back onto the sidewalk after they have been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13792.172s">[Bears]</a>: So there's even issues like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13794.955s">[Bears]</a>: And the question of sand and maybe replacing that word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13797.517s">[Bears]</a>: So the goal is to have this discussion soon in the Public Works Subcommittee to discuss any issues, improve the existing ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13805.485s">[Bears]</a>: And I would move to refer this item to the Public Works Subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13884.007s">[Bears]</a>: I would be happy to entertain that as an amendment for further discussion in subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13889.924s">[Bears]</a>: And my button is now stuck, so I'm going to try my best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14906.72s">[Bears]</a>: Happy to take them as amendments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14910.424s">[Bears]</a>: That's fine with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14911.987s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Mr. President, I just can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15010.405s">[Bears]</a>: I think the clerk can go first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15025.868s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15026.729s">[Bears]</a>: I won't belabor this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15027.55s">[Bears]</a>: I want to say that I agree with basically everything Councilor Mark said and Councilor Scarpelli said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15032.734s">[Bears]</a>: I took the last language that I could find that had gone to the Public Works Subcommittee previously and put it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15040.882s">[Bears]</a>: I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15041.742s">[Bears]</a>: You're absolutely right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15043.923s">[Bears]</a>: When I read it, I didn't think it'd be $2,000, but obviously that's not a fine that would be acceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15048.684s">[Bears]</a>: So I think a lot of the points that were brought up by me and Council Marks and Councilors Scarpelli will be discussed in the subcommittee and hopefully we can get to a good answer and make a program that works for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15061.169s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15643.903s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15644.083s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15780.275s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16256.713s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16522.749s">[Bears]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17153.578s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17155.8s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I mean, I think we need to move forward in getting something temporary set up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17159.162s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think, you know, I'm glad that there's progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17161.003s">[Bears]</a>: I think that's an encouraging sign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17162.404s">[Bears]</a>: I think we know that we're meeting about an initial design study, so that means there's more time coming before we get a permanent solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17168.968s">[Bears]</a>: And I would just also make sure that we CC Senator Jalen as well, because anything that, anything's going to have to go through both houses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17177.614s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17189.414s">[Bears]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17434.17s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17582.927s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17585.27s">[Bears]</a>: I've been talking to residents about this and I agree with my fellow Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17588.473s">[Bears]</a>: I think it's also not a safe intersection if you're driving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17590.776s">[Bears]</a>: I think this is a win, win, win across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17593.098s">[Bears]</a>: I'm not on my bike over there very often, but I am in my car and you can get hit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17599.685s">[Bears]</a>: You could be hitting someone or you could, your car could be hit either way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17603.968s">[Bears]</a>: It's a dangerous area that needs to be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17606.91s">[Bears]</a>: Just one thing for everyone to know that DCR has a study on the whole Mystic Valley Parkway, and technically that intersection is part of the Mystic Valley Parkway, which actually crosses the bridge there from the Arlington side back to the Medford side, and then goes up by the lakes towards the boat club.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17622.04s">[Bears]</a>: So there's a whole study in place, but it's just a study to look at what they wanna do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17626.063s">[Bears]</a>: It doesn't have a short-term element that would actually address any of the things that we've been talking about, so I think it's really important that we try to work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17634.068s">[Bears]</a>: since there is DCR jurisdiction, hopefully they might provide some leeway for some short-term improvements in addition to the study that they have ongoing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17643.655s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17994.663s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you, Vice President Caraviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17997.004s">[Bears]</a>: I've spoken to some residents who've been frustrated as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17999.825s">[Bears]</a>: The issue with Lexington is that prior to COVID, you could go even if you weren't a part of the consortium on certain days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18006.348s">[Bears]</a>: Now with COVID, they've closed<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18008.709s">[Bears]</a>: basically only if your city or town is part of that consortium can you go at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18013.17s">[Bears]</a>: So it's also kind of this COVID angle to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18016.451s">[Bears]</a>: I've spoken to the chief of staff and the DPW director about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18020.692s">[Bears]</a>: They've had some kind of alternative suggestions and said they'd get back to me on when Lexington allowed people, but I appreciate Vice President Caraviello bringing this forward because I haven't seen the action, the urgent action on this since the conversations I've had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18037.776s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18166.121s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. President, I'm really glad that the Building Department and the Historical Commission have finally put together a system to streamline this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18174.289s">[Bears]</a>: I think it's improved things and I agree with Vice President Caraviello when I've contacted the Historical Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18179.433s">[Bears]</a>: They've been incredibly prompt with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18184.778s">[Bears]</a>: It'd be my preference that we strike the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18188.706s">[Bears]</a>: the words the historical commission from this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18190.547s">[Bears]</a>: I think the building department is the entity responsible for notifying people about building permits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18196.908s">[Bears]</a>: I think that's a question we have an answer to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18200.129s">[Bears]</a>: The question is, why aren't those notifications going out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18203.23s">[Bears]</a>: So that would just be my preference here, if that's fine with Vice President Caraviello as an amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18208.051s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18209.251s">[Bears]</a>: I've had some experience with this as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18211.592s">[Bears]</a>: I understand the frustration that property owners are feeling on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18215.353s">[Bears]</a>: and having to call and kind of get things moving as a Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18218.094s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think that's how, I don't think that should be our role, quite frankly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18221.016s">[Bears]</a>: I think it should just be going smoothly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18224.498s">[Bears]</a>: So I think it also goes back to some other points, which is that I think maybe our building department might need sufficient staffing to get this done as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18232.442s">[Bears]</a>: But for now, I just ask that we strike the words, the Historical Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18236.744s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18237.464s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Vice President Kirby.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18243.607s">[Bears]</a>: In the first line, the 10th word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18315.958s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. President, I would just want to say, I think comparing this to the situation at 16 foster court is not an apt comparison and I don't think we should be doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18325.626s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18336.775s">[Bears]</a>: Please call the roll as amended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18437.71s">[Bears]</a>: Again, I think that just goes to the heart of the issue, right, which is the Historical Commission is doing its work promptly, and it's sitting at the building department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18445.475s">[Bears]</a>: Are they all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18445.996s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18446.836s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18447.457s">[Bears]</a>: Are they all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18448.398s">[Bears]</a>: They are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18448.838s">[Bears]</a>: 17 months?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18449.218s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18451.62s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, again, could have showed up to any meeting, but that's another issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18457.509s">[Bears]</a>: It's yeah, the Historical Commission's doing them promptly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18459.731s">[Bears]</a>: It's going to the building department and the notification's not being sent out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18462.454s">[Bears]</a>: I fully agree with the proposal to have the notification sent out within 72 hours because that's what should be happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18468.62s">[Bears]</a>: So the issue here, permitting authorities, the building department, permitting authorities not providing prompt notification, we should ask them to provide prompt notification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18477.168s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18510.759s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18512.08s">[Bears]</a>: From what we've seen, all evidence, all matters are being addressed promptly and sent to the building department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18517.922s">[Bears]</a>: If we want to propose some sort of request for a policy change, I'm not opposed to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18523.264s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just saying right now, we know where the breakdown is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18535.748s">[Bears]</a>: I agree with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18536.868s">[Bears]</a>: I call the building department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18538.849s">[Bears]</a>: That's where the problem is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18776.206s">[Bears]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18784.909s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18785.629s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=19101.024s">[Bears]</a>: I won't speak long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=19102.265s">[Bears]</a>: I think Councilor Marks did a wonderful job, but it was really sad to see so many people across our community coming to terms with this news, especially our arts community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=19110.63s">[Bears]</a>: And my thoughts are with everyone who's hurting right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=19113.833s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=19234.126s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=19316.657s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=19342.656s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=151.476s">[Bears]</a>: people will be eating in the restaurant and so it's going to be mostly takeout delivery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=158.938s">[Bears]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=958.642s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=959.962s">[Bears]</a>: I haven't spoken yet because my fellow councilors said everything that needed to be said, but I just want to add that I'm fully in support of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=966.265s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3286.922s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3288.743s">[Bears]</a>: So, you know, I found out relatively recently, we had an art installation that was to open our parks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3297.1s">[Bears]</a>: funded by a Medford resident, funded by the Medford Arts Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3300.842s">[Bears]</a>: And the idea was to have, you know, discussion-provoking and thought-provoking art installation around the issues of racism and white supremacy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3313.61s">[Bears]</a>: And I was disappointed to learn that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3318.803s">[Bears]</a>: That installation had gone up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3320.164s">[Bears]</a>: Again, this was funded with city money approved by our parks commission on multiple occasions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3325.307s">[Bears]</a>: It was installed at a local city park and within a few days it had been torn down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3331.45s">[Bears]</a>: And then it was, I think, crowdfunded again to find the money to print it, install it, put it up again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3337.794s">[Bears]</a>: And once again, it was torn down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3341.456s">[Bears]</a>: And I think, you know, we should thank the artist, a Medford resident here,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3347.421s">[Bears]</a>: for the effort to go through this but I also think it's important that we hear from from her and you know what went into this and maybe have some discussions about why this happened multiple times in our community and you know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3366.107s">[Bears]</a>: The idea was to have discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3367.488s">[Bears]</a>: I think the art installations weren't up long enough for us to have those discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3371.29s">[Bears]</a>: So maybe we can have some of them here today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3373.171s">[Bears]</a>: And I know that we do have the artist here to speak on this matter, if we want to hear from her as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3380.896s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4475.362s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. President, if I may.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4479.755s">[Bears]</a>: You good with custom marks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4517.32s">[Bears]</a>: Well, and that that's exactly the question I was going to have is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4522.438s">[Bears]</a>: Why, why wasn't this put out there we get a lot of press releases we have a city newsletter we have things coming out from different departments, you know, pretty much all the time we have social media, you know, this wasn't advertised and I think two things here really speak to me one the fact that it initially wasn't even really talked about initially it wasn't put out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4540.854s">[Bears]</a>: You know, it's a city funded initiative comes from the Arts Council going into our parks, and it's addressing what this council has said is a major priority what the city administration is that is a major priority, and it got no play no advertisement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4553.319s">[Bears]</a>: I didn't know about it if people on this council didn't know about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4556.82s">[Bears]</a>: And we represent the city we're in City Hall more than more than most other folks than most people didn't know about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4562.782s">[Bears]</a>: And then the second piece is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4565.703s">[Bears]</a>: we didn't hear about what happened to the installation either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4569.825s">[Bears]</a>: There was no statement, there was no discussion, there was a few sentences of an email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4575.529s">[Bears]</a>: And that's the question I think when you look at both of those, it reads to me as part of the larger problem, which is we say we wanna do something, we say we wanna talk about it, and I think you made this point actually about a year and a half ago, which is we can talk about it, but what are we doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4593.359s">[Bears]</a>: And the doing piece was never done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4596.105s">[Bears]</a>: And so, I have another resolution on here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4598.066s">[Bears]</a>: We're gonna talk about it in a minute, which is to ask, what have we been doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4601.927s">[Bears]</a>: But I think what we're hearing here tonight and what we probably knew already is we're clearly not doing enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4607.369s">[Bears]</a>: And in some cases, we're not doing anything at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4610.69s">[Bears]</a>: And that is a shame to say the very least, but I think it also means we're not gonna move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4616.192s">[Bears]</a>: So I'm just glad that this is out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4618.253s">[Bears]</a>: I'm glad that we're having a discussion tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4620.494s">[Bears]</a>: I hope that other folks are hearing this as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4624.695s">[Bears]</a>: And I hope, you know, to be to be honest that that we hear more about this in the in the days and weeks to come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4630.938s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4906.574s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4907.556s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4909.418s">[Bears]</a>: I just wanted to say to Meredith, by the way, you know, I think the Arts Council, we know you're a volunteer body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4914.245s">[Bears]</a>: You're doing what you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4915.867s">[Bears]</a>: You have the followers that you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4917.975s">[Bears]</a>: It would be, I think when we were talking about outreach, it's how is the city boosting that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4921.917s">[Bears]</a>: How are we using the resources of the city to get that out there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4925.518s">[Bears]</a>: So I know it maybe came off a little bit as on the arts council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4929.98s">[Bears]</a>: You, we know that you do amazing work and you know, the support for that, I think would have been really additive in this situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4939.364s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5394.724s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5396.926s">[Bears]</a>: I did put this resolution on the agenda to further the conversation we had and also to do what we can as a council, I think,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5406.209s">[Bears]</a>: You know, as we know, we've had a lot of discussions about the power of the mayor and the administration recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5411.891s">[Bears]</a>: And it's our job to ask what's going on, what's happening, are the commitments that are being made being followed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5418.154s">[Bears]</a>: So that's the intent of this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5420.494s">[Bears]</a>: And I think just if I may for a moment, you know, one piece of this is conversations and dialogue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5426.477s">[Bears]</a>: And I think that's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5427.777s">[Bears]</a>: It's important for bringing people together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5429.838s">[Bears]</a>: It's important for changing hearts and minds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5432.341s">[Bears]</a>: And it's important for meeting across differences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5435.725s">[Bears]</a>: And I think there's a lot of value there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5437.628s">[Bears]</a>: And I do want to know what the administration is doing on that front.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5440.972s">[Bears]</a>: The other piece of this is policy and change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5444.616s">[Bears]</a>: What are we doing to review city policies to make sure that they don't have disparate impact?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5449.659s">[Bears]</a>: What are we doing to review city ordinances and our city budget to see that we're funding, our funding priorities are meeting the stated verbal priorities that we're putting out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5459.105s">[Bears]</a>: What are we doing when it comes to zoning and housing production and environmental justice and climate change to address racial inequities that cross all of those intersections?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5469.311s">[Bears]</a>: So, you know, a piece of this is dialogue and conversation that I think is very, very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5473.817s">[Bears]</a>: And I think the other piece is the work of government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5476.539s">[Bears]</a>: What are our policies?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5477.78s">[Bears]</a>: How are they being reviewed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5479.341s">[Bears]</a>: And I think some of it as well, we've had some meetings as a council in subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5483.904s">[Bears]</a>: We've had discussions in full council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5487.727s">[Bears]</a>: The mayor's administration facilitated some conversations last year, and that was a good starting point, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5495.252s">[Bears]</a>: But again, it was volunteers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5496.873s">[Bears]</a>: It was people scrambling to get people to facilitate breakout rooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5502.136s">[Bears]</a>: It wasn't like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5503.297s">[Bears]</a>: we were putting together a full plan and saying, here's how we're going to fund it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5507.159s">[Bears]</a>: This is the purpose that it's going to seek.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5509.36s">[Bears]</a>: So, you know, I think concreteness is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5512.261s">[Bears]</a>: I think understanding the outcomes we're trying to achieve is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5515.283s">[Bears]</a>: And I especially think that paired with good conversation and dialogue must be the real work of looking into, you know, and I think we all know this as well on many fronts, we have many old policies and old forms and old ways that we do things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5532.355s">[Bears]</a>: Maybe we need to take a look at some of those I'm not going to lay out any specifics, I want to hear what what's happening I want the administration to report back on what they've been doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5540.809s">[Bears]</a>: And I just hope that the answer isn't insufficient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5543.834s">[Bears]</a>: Maybe it will be maybe it won't be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5547.461s">[Bears]</a>: We need to know what the administration is doing on policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5551.143s">[Bears]</a>: And then I also hope that we as a council will continue to raise these efforts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5555.505s">[Bears]</a>: And to be honest, I think we have brought this up when it comes to zoning recodification, we've had some good discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5560.928s">[Bears]</a>: When it comes to the marijuana zoning ordinance, we had some good discussions and put some strong equity provisions in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5567.071s">[Bears]</a>: We have made some declarations as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5570.413s">[Bears]</a>: Is it enough?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5571.593s">[Bears]</a>: I think maybe we need to do more, but you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5575.888s">[Bears]</a>: We've taken some steps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5576.809s">[Bears]</a>: I want to hear what the administration steps are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5579.313s">[Bears]</a>: And I'm very hopeful that in the next round of budget discussions, we will have that more clearly outlined in, in both staffing and programming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5590.227s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5590.748s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6468.822s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6474.005s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6476.266s">[Bears]</a>: My intention with this resolution certainly wasn't to have this argument again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6480.108s">[Bears]</a>: But, you know, I think regardless, you know, I do want to amend this resolution to ask when<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6489.622s">[Bears]</a>: The, if, if it already has been, or when will the diversity director position be posted because I do believe we can have an argument one office two offices we all agree to positions, we certainly agree with that, a full time diversity position and the HR position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6507.353s">[Bears]</a>: Um, so then where we ended up with two offices and two positions and, you know, that's fine because we have the two positions, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6513.796s">[Bears]</a>: So I wasn't to relitigate that specific question, but I haven't seen whether that has been posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6520.659s">[Bears]</a>: So my, my amendment is just to request to ask if, or if it has been posted or when it will be posted for the diversity position, I haven't seen it in the list of open city jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6530.283s">[Bears]</a>: Um, so that means we still have, well, I guess now we have nobody doing that job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6536.365s">[Bears]</a>: Right, because for a while it was, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6539.986s">[Bears]</a>: And well, I, you know, at least since the last budget was passed, because, you know, there was a budget that eliminated the position, which I voted against.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6547.528s">[Bears]</a>: There's a budget that restored the position, which I voted for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6549.889s">[Bears]</a>: But in any case, I would like to just know that answer to that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6556.711s">[Bears]</a>: And I'll leave it at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6557.671s">[Bears]</a>: But yeah, I think we should look forward at what we can do, not what has happened necessarily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6564.434s">[Bears]</a>: in the past few months with city budget discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7555.582s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you for your accuracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7557.003s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7558.064s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7558.344s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7558.424s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7558.584s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8410.942s">[Bears]</a>: The king of Paris Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8586.535s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. President, point of personal privilege, if I may.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8589.537s">[Bears]</a>: I'm sorry to do this to everyone at the end of the meeting, but I'm a little sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8594.121s">[Bears]</a>: I just want to make a quick statement, if you'll indulge me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8597.344s">[Bears]</a>: This is just on reference to something I said last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8601.684s">[Bears]</a>: You know, the word totalitarianism was brought up to describe our form of government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8606.647s">[Bears]</a>: And I made a comment that this is democracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8612.511s">[Bears]</a>: And I just would like to clarify, because there's been some commentary and speculation about what I was saying, that I was talking about the election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8618.735s">[Bears]</a>: I was talking about who I'm supporting in the local election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8621.597s">[Bears]</a>: And I just want to make a quick point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8622.997s">[Bears]</a>: It actually relates exactly to what General Elasky and Judy Murray have been doing for several decades in this community, which is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8631.192s">[Bears]</a>: about democracy and the fact that we're blessed in our country and in our city to have a government of, for, and by the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8638.912s">[Bears]</a>: that we elect our leaders by majority vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8641.213s">[Bears]</a>: And if we like them, we can keep them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8643.155s">[Bears]</a>: And if we don't, we can elect somebody else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8646.176s">[Bears]</a>: You know, we've seen a lot of people on television and online making statements and lying to undermine our democratic process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8654.822s">[Bears]</a>: And, you know, occasionally people bring those lies into this room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8658.464s">[Bears]</a>: They throw around words like totalitarianism to describe our democratic process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8663.347s">[Bears]</a>: And it more than frustrates me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8665.708s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know what that beeping is, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8680.711s">[Bears]</a>: Well, I'm gonna wait, or if you take it out of the room, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8734.393s">[Bears]</a>: I won't start over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8735.614s">[Bears]</a>: But I'll just continue to say that it more than frustrates me when people come in here and throw around words like that when we have a democratic system of government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8743.658s">[Bears]</a>: Everyone behind this rail, our school committee, and the mayor was elected democratically by the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8748.921s">[Bears]</a>: None of us are perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8750.402s">[Bears]</a>: We're all going to make mistakes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8751.823s">[Bears]</a>: And I think I know better than most that I'm not always going to get my way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8757.026s">[Bears]</a>: Nobody's always going to get their way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8758.627s">[Bears]</a>: And that's what democracy is about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8760.388s">[Bears]</a>: It's a blessing and a gift handed down to us by the people who came before us that many people have fought for died for on battlefields and in streets across this country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8771.653s">[Bears]</a>: It's our job to preserve that to improve that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8774.212s">[Bears]</a>: and not to decry and undermine that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8775.953s">[Bears]</a>: So when I said last week that this is not totalitarianism and it's an election season, I wasn't speaking in a small and parochial way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8784.357s">[Bears]</a>: I was speaking in a way that's bigger than every one of us and any one of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8789.44s">[Bears]</a>: We are blessed that every two years at every level of government, we get a peaceful revolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8795.543s">[Bears]</a>: We get to decide our future and we get to preserve, protect and improve democracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8800.946s">[Bears]</a>: That's what we all are here to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8802.807s">[Bears]</a>: That's what I will continue to do as long as the people of Medford allow me to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8807.011s">[Bears]</a>: And I just wanted to make that clear to folks online who thought I was making a snide comment when I was actually talking about something much more important than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8815.079s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8882.333s">[Bears]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8893.659s">[Bears]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=809.508s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you, Mary Ann, for your update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=812.929s">[Bears]</a>: It seems like, again, the clarion call is needed to say that we are not out of the woods and that we are months away, if not several months away, from being able to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=826.604s">[Bears]</a>: have gatherings or, you know, anything like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=829.586s">[Bears]</a>: Um, so I just appreciate you noting that the cases are back on the rise, uh, and that we aren't, you know, we haven't even, we aren't even at the levels we were at last summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=839.171s">[Bears]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=839.431s">[Bears]</a>: So we are still above the levels we were at last summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=843.153s">[Bears]</a>: Um, when, you know, we, that was the lowest we've been since this started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=847.015s">[Bears]</a>: Um, so I just wanted to ask, um, has there been any discussion<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=851.906s">[Bears]</a>: of slowing down Medford's progression through the reopening phases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=856.187s">[Bears]</a>: I know a lot of local communities have said that they feel the governor's approach has been too aggressive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=862.528s">[Bears]</a>: So I was just wondering if you had discussed that or if there was anything on the horizon on that front.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=886.707s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks, Marianne.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=887.468s">[Bears]</a>: And yeah, I just think we need to stay strong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=890.988s">[Bears]</a>: We don't want our summer to be ruined by trying to do too much this spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=895.849s">[Bears]</a>: So stay safe and get a vaccine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=899.07s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks, Marianne.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1697.124s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. President, uh, I have pressed the button asking them to unmute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1702.846s">[Bears]</a>: Um, they may need, they need to accept it on their end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1705.668s">[Bears]</a>: So, um, you need to press a button that'll come up on your screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2333.894s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2338.017s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2338.657s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2339.638s">[Bears]</a>: Um, I just wanted to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2341.44s">[Bears]</a>: add a further amendment that Lawrence Memorial come back 90 days after they complete the project, just so we can make sure that as operations continue, that the commitments are being met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2355.791s">[Bears]</a>: I'm glad to hear about the lighting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2357.613s">[Bears]</a>: I know that was a major concern, but I just want to make sure that the lights are really shutting off at those times once things are underway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2684.547s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2685.608s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you and Councilor Falco for putting this resolution on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2688.688s">[Bears]</a>: I'm a resident of the Heights as well and grew up here and took the 710 regularly when I was younger.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2695.029s">[Bears]</a>: And I can tell you, you know, the people who use this, this is seniors getting groceries and prescriptions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2700.95s">[Bears]</a>: You know, this is families who may not have a car who need to access essential services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2706.471s">[Bears]</a>: even regardless of commuting and not commuting, what this is providing is people access to local businesses, grocery stores, pharmacies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2714.737s">[Bears]</a>: So I think it's incredibly important that the service is reinstated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2718.36s">[Bears]</a>: I would also just like to amend the resolution to see if there's an update from our resolution around the 325 and 326 service cuts as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3842.945s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3844.506s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3845.487s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Marks, for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3847.789s">[Bears]</a>: I was just wondering if I could amend, I may not have gotten the language quite right, but amend the first motion to have a list of any subsidized units that may be expiring in the next 10 years, because I do recall a meeting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3864.401s">[Bears]</a>: where there were a number of units in addition to the 38 that Councilor Marks mentioned that had time limits on the affordability requirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=873.794s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=874.534s">[Bears]</a>: Alicia, just a quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=876.235s">[Bears]</a>: Are we voting on the additional stuff that you just presented to us or is that coming at a later time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=882.258s">[Bears]</a>: The COVID stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=915.58s">[Bears]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=973.959s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3092.057s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3094.138s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3095.539s">[Bears]</a>: I just want to second, thanks to everyone who advocated for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3099.14s">[Bears]</a>: I was in the first, fifth grade at the Brooks, and I can remember how dangerous it was even then as a 10 year old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3106.123s">[Bears]</a>: I had two questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3108.764s">[Bears]</a>: One is just about Councilor Marks' motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3112.546s">[Bears]</a>: Would that just be between Winthrop Circle and the Woburn Street intersection?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3163.257s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, no, I totally agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3164.698s">[Bears]</a>: And I'm actually, I think, leaving it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3166.939s">[Bears]</a>: I would be encouraged to see both sections of how we could do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3171.161s">[Bears]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3172.882s">[Bears]</a>: So just wanted to make sure on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3173.902s">[Bears]</a>: And then Tim, kind of similar question, just what would it be possible to, what would it take to do that in your estimation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3278.622s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3279.322s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks, Tim.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3281.264s">[Bears]</a>: When you look at it, if we could look at something temporary, at least in between Winthrop Circle and Woburn, maybe just if we're not resurfacing, could we do temporary paint?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3290.272s">[Bears]</a>: Just kind of thinking of that as a focus area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3321.344s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3321.604s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3321.844s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3322.104s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3322.324s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3322.524s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3322.765s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3323.085s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3323.405s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3323.765s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3324.125s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4129.672s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. President, while we're under suspension, motion to take paper 20-354 out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4160.085s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4162.662s">[Bears]</a>: I know we have Director Hunt on the call, so we were able to start through the CPA, this rental assistance program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4168.988s">[Bears]</a>: It's up through ABCD Malden and Housing Families is providing some information as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4174.233s">[Bears]</a>: So I was hoping that Director Hunt might be able to provide a little bit more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4417.622s">[Bears]</a>: No, thanks, Alicia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4418.402s">[Bears]</a>: I'm sorry for putting you on the spot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4419.723s">[Bears]</a>: I know we had Roberta Cameron on earlier, but I think she had to hop off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4422.805s">[Bears]</a>: So I really appreciate you taking that on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5923.758s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5925.118s">[Bears]</a>: I guess just, I wasn't here for all that legislative history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5929.459s">[Bears]</a>: I guess my only question right now, and I might want to do some more research.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5933.64s">[Bears]</a>: And until I do that, I don't think I could vote for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5936.92s">[Bears]</a>: But when the council passed,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5941.232s">[Bears]</a>: the paper saying that we approve of the solicitor's opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5944.213s">[Bears]</a>: Did that change the ordinance and the issues with the ordinance that we're having?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6095.7s">[Bears]</a>: Not really, I guess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6097.327s">[Bears]</a>: So there's a clarification that the ordinance is wrong, but the incorrect language is still in the zoning ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6102.329s">[Bears]</a>: Is that basically where we are?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6195.55s">[Bears]</a>: Not at this time, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6804.719s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6805.74s">[Bears]</a>: I agree with much of what Councilor Knight just said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6808.201s">[Bears]</a>: I'd just like to propose a B paper that the city administration also report to us, have discussions with the Division of Local Services, the Department of Revenue, and report back to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6821.523s">[Bears]</a>: on any options for municipal bonds to cover operating expenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6826.544s">[Bears]</a>: I think in the case, so that's the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6829.725s">[Bears]</a>: And then I have to just think in the case that the federal, you know, it's very possible that a federal bailout won't be forthcoming or it won't be timely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6837.726s">[Bears]</a>: And I think we should explore all options to make sure that we don't have to make more cuts because as has been said many times, and as Councilor Knight just said, we haven't recovered from the last round of cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7614.993s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7615.954s">[Bears]</a>: And I don't want to sound like a broken record, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7618.39s">[Bears]</a>: You know, we're talking about a second great depression level of numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7621.433s">[Bears]</a>: We're talking about unemployment numbers and economic numbers that we haven't seen in a hundred years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7627.519s">[Bears]</a>: And I think looking at alternative revenue sources is important, but I think this overarching point that we really can't afford to cut any more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7633.606s">[Bears]</a>: And the back end of that point is that there's actually going to be a higher demand for our services through this crisis and at the end of the crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7642.639s">[Bears]</a>: You know, I really think we need to explore all options, alternative revenue sources, and really lean into this idea that it might be important for us to try to cover this deficit with bonding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7652.445s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, it's a once in a century question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7655.227s">[Bears]</a>: It's a once in a century question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7656.888s">[Bears]</a>: And if the choice is cutting essential services that we'll never get back, I think we need to make that hard choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7804.921s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you Yeah, and I mean it is it's scary I don't mean to say that we should just be doing this willy-nilly and doing it without planning that's not the point but it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7816.283s">[Bears]</a>: It's having that backstop at the end of the day, because I agree there's a cost to future generations, but you have to do that cost-benefit analysis, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7823.167s">[Bears]</a>: Is the cost of losing 10, 20 city staff and maybe never getting them back more than the cost of a bond, and if we can minimize that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7831.211s">[Bears]</a>: So just really exploring the options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7832.651s">[Bears]</a>: And my hope is that we're, I like the Medford way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7835.733s">[Bears]</a>: I like that we get out and do things first, as Councilor Knight was saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7838.735s">[Bears]</a>: My hope on something like this is that we are in lockstep with other communities in the state if we have to go this route.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7844.578s">[Bears]</a>: And really, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7846.112s">[Bears]</a>: The fundamental question is that's not our role as municipal and state government But it's getting to the point of the question is the federal government going to abrogate its role Its role is to borrow to bail us out because it's the one that can do it If it's going to say we're not going to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7860.275s">[Bears]</a>: We've got to look at another option because it's a hundred year crisis You know, I i'm it's scary and I completely hear what everyone's saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7867.416s">[Bears]</a>: So it's not just We can do whatever and fix the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7870.777s">[Bears]</a>: It's having that backstop if if all of our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7873.667s">[Bears]</a>: other systems don't succeed to keep us in the place we need to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7913.438s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, and just specifically, Municipal Bond Deficit Financing Authority or authorization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9586.632s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9587.572s">[Bears]</a>: And thank you, Councilor Marks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9589.963s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just looking at, we got some resolutions back from the mayor, and there's a letter from Brian Cairns in here regarding Maple Park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9598.925s">[Bears]</a>: And it says, it talks a lot about the trash, but it says that we agree that residents at Maple Park can participate in the city's bulk pickup, the cost for bulk items for the new fiscal year is 22 per item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9608.967s">[Bears]</a>: So I don't know if that means that they have done this already or not, but that's just what I, I just remembered reading that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9617.506s">[Bears]</a>: This was in response to your 20-09-4.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9639.677s">[Bears]</a>: That's interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9641.838s">[Bears]</a>: The clerk forwarded us, there was a ton of stuff in here, but there's a letter dated April 20th of this year from Brian Cairns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9648.844s">[Bears]</a>: And the last sentence says,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9651.06s">[Bears]</a>: Also, do we agree that residents at Maple Park can participate in the city's bulk pickup?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9655.443s">[Bears]</a>: So I think maybe that needs to be communicated back to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9748.7s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, and I think just along that point as well, you know, it says in this letter from Brian Karen's, you know, there's a lot of talk about trash pickup, which they currently aren't part of the city's trash pickup.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9757.724s">[Bears]</a>: But I think we said that they are part of recycling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9759.685s">[Bears]</a>: And in here, it says, also, currently, this location is not putting out anything for recycling, at least not for city pickup.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9765.728s">[Bears]</a>: So they may even be paying for recycling and the building might not even be using it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9769.61s">[Bears]</a>: So that was just another interesting thing I saw in that letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9854.605s">[Bears]</a>: Come on down, let's talk trash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=10239.111s">[Bears]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=10240.292s">[Bears]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=10249.398s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=10348.154s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Bears?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=10349.435s">[Bears]</a>: I just want to add, you know, that Councilor, I mentioned the GoFundMe, we've seen incredible generosity from the Medford community over the past 24 hours to these families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=10357.48s">[Bears]</a>: So I just want to note that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=344.049s">[Bears]</a>: You're all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=345.469s">[Bears]</a>: I would just if, if Councilor Knight would be so amenable to amend this to include that minutes be posted, even if the meetings are occurring in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=359.353s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=691.783s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=693.604s">[Bears]</a>: Definitely support the intent of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=695.805s">[Bears]</a>: If the Councilor would be so amenable to refer this to the committee on rules and ordinances I think we could have the discussion in there by the end of February and get this set up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=727.159s">[Bears]</a>: Then I would move to refer to that committee on ordinances and rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=736.483s">[Bears]</a>: the subcommittee on ordinances and rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1169.652s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1171.013s">[Bears]</a>: I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1172.484s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Collins made a good statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1175.066s">[Bears]</a>: Every city vehicle should be a safe vehicle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1176.828s">[Bears]</a>: And I would just like to, if folks are comfortable with this as an amendment, just ask, there's been a shift.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1184.974s">[Bears]</a>: I remember when I was younger, we actually had patrol cars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1187.816s">[Bears]</a>: They were cars and now we've moved more to SUVs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1191.519s">[Bears]</a>: And I just would like to amend this to ask going forward, if the plan is to continue with SUV size vehicles and ask why that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1855.867s">[Bears]</a>: Not eligible next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1870.341s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. President, if I may.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1873.382s">[Bears]</a>: Just before we consider the records.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1876.163s">[Bears]</a>: Just wanted to let everybody know that I'm on zoom because I tested positive for COVID-19.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1882.445s">[Bears]</a>: It is no fun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1883.206s">[Bears]</a>: I am fully vaccinated and boosted, and it still is not fun was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1891.348s">[Bears]</a>: taking precautions, wearing masks everywhere, not going in big crowds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1894.811s">[Bears]</a>: So just wanted to put out a point of note that, you know, the virus is still out there spreading widely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1899.855s">[Bears]</a>: I'm still not sure how I got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1902.817s">[Bears]</a>: I've talked to all my close contacts and they're all negative and asymptomatic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1907.481s">[Bears]</a>: So, you know, it's out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1909.863s">[Bears]</a>: And as I said, it's no fun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1912.205s">[Bears]</a>: And I tested positive on a rapid test and just want to make a point that if you test positive on a rapid test in Medford, let the board of health know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1920.61s">[Bears]</a>: You can email them through the city website email our public health nurse Sarah Harris, and it just helps to keep the statistics up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1928.333s">[Bears]</a>: So, just wanted to let you guys know I already let all the Councilors know and the staff that I was around last week, but I just wanted to put that message out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1937.116s">[Bears]</a>: I'm really glad that I'm vaccinated and boosted otherwise I think I would feel a lot worse, and I hope to be back with you in a couple weeks in the chamber.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1945.439s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=191.942s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=193.463s">[Bears]</a>: I would just ask my colleagues if we could table this until next week, just in case Councilor Morell would want to speak as to the timing of the caucus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=202.629s">[Bears]</a>: So motion to table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=306.375s">[Bears]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=521.428s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=522.268s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, councilor Scarpelli for putting this on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=524.069s">[Bears]</a>: I completely agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=525.89s">[Bears]</a>: Um, I think we really need to know what this money has been spent on and how much is left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=531.353s">[Bears]</a>: Um, and I think that's becoming even more important as the stimulus talks and the federal government are talking about being able to use this money for a broader range of purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=538.857s">[Bears]</a>: I think it's important that we know how much is there and still remains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=542.719s">[Bears]</a>: Um, in addition to what it's been spent on already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=545.721s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=688.513s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=689.373s">[Bears]</a>: I think councilor Scarpelli basically answered my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=692.134s">[Bears]</a>: Um, but is this would be part of the conversations around the main and South redesign or are you trying to get something in there prior to that happening?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=947.992s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=948.813s">[Bears]</a>: I was just wondering if a representative of the administration could tell us how much is in the TNC, the TNC surcharge municipal distribution receipts reserved account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=986.204s">[Bears]</a>: And how?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1001.727s">[Bears]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1002.128s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2659.358s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks, Todd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2664.782s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2665.723s">[Bears]</a>: And thank you, Todd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2666.303s">[Bears]</a>: I have a couple of questions for you through the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2668.345s">[Bears]</a>: It kind of goes off what Councilor Scarpelli just said, these bollards and sticks and posts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2675.762s">[Bears]</a>: Are there any plans in some of these locations, at least thoughts about designs for a more permanent narrowing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2683.624s">[Bears]</a>: Or is the idea just to kind of have these cones and then go to flex posts as a next step?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2798.456s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks, Todd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2798.996s">[Bears]</a>: And just another question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2800.337s">[Bears]</a>: It's not actually directly on this TNC appropriation, but I've gotten calls from a couple of residents concerned about access to their driveways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2809.759s">[Bears]</a>: They kind of live near some of these new cone projects, and they're having a difficult time getting in and out of their driveways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2816.261s">[Bears]</a>: Did you talk to abutters who might be disrupted by the new cones that have been put up about that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2949.735s">[Bears]</a>: I think that's the exact tone to approach this with, Todd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2954.1s">[Bears]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3321.609s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3385.731s">[Bears]</a>: Motion to take papers in the hands of the clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3387.591s">[Bears]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3740.833s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3760.444s">[Bears]</a>: Totally fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3761.105s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3762.385s">[Bears]</a>: I just want to thank Noah as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3764.226s">[Bears]</a>: And I think Noah's work on this, and I know also has worked with many other young Medford residents on this as well, really speaks to how involved so many young people are in our community and all the different facets of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3778.651s">[Bears]</a>: helping veterans, arts, culture, city government, and everything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3783.172s">[Bears]</a>: I just think we should be recognizing that and recognizing the great work of our public school system and our general community and raising a great crop of young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3792.934s">[Bears]</a>: So thank you, Noah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3871.619s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. President, I found the records dutifully taken and presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=95.751s">[Bears]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1982.287s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1983.788s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know, possible and also making sure that with only two households using this, I mean, that might be that people don't want to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1997.233s">[Bears]</a>: My people be that people don't know that the cap was raised to 40,000 recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2001.114s">[Bears]</a>: I think there's a lot of information questions there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2003.315s">[Bears]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2004.413s">[Bears]</a>: I just strongly support this motion and the B paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4495.514s">[Bears]</a>: As someone who used textile recycling this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4497.676s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4498.196s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4499.437s">[Bears]</a>: And I also that yeah I got it from the first but much appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4510.643s">[Bears]</a>: I think this is an important issue and I just wanted to make my own joke which is I think it's always good when the person you're trying to regulate is asking for regulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4517.828s">[Bears]</a>: So I'm encouraged by this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4683.504s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4687.597s">[Bears]</a>: Introduce this resolution with Councilor Morell because as I think many people in the room and it's already come up once tonight but also many people across the city know there are now several applications under Chapter 40 B for a large new housing developments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4702.423s">[Bears]</a>: There is the one on Mystic Valley Parkway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4705.624s">[Bears]</a>: There's also one on the Fells way and now combined properties has issued.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4710.727s">[Bears]</a>: At least started the process around Mystic Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4714.391s">[Bears]</a>: These are I mean I think those add up to almost a thousand new units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4717.514s">[Bears]</a>: It might even be more than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4718.595s">[Bears]</a>: I'll have to double check my math.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4720.076s">[Bears]</a>: But obviously that's significant new development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4723.739s">[Bears]</a>: And it's happening under state statute that limits some of our ability to control development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4731.089s">[Bears]</a>: I think as I've said many times to people that all of this development should be community driven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4738.219s">[Bears]</a>: We need to have community driven processes to make sure that development is happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4741.806s">[Bears]</a>: The way that we wanted to happen, not the way that developers wanted to happen, but as I said, anything that's coming through 40 B puts us in a much more difficult position to get that done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4751.569s">[Bears]</a>: We will need strong community and administrative pushback, or at least, you know, really a strong movement around these projects to see what we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4761.272s">[Bears]</a>: To make them fit into the community and in a reasonable way if possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4766.958s">[Bears]</a>: And I think it just speaks a couple things specifically on 40 B that I want to get out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4770.762s">[Bears]</a>: It really speaks to the need to get to safe harbor around this so that we can make sure that developers are negotiating with the city and with the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4779.674s">[Bears]</a>: And also just speaks to the fact that on any of these in any of these developments all of the affordable you know the defined affordable units need to be in perpetuity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4791.702s">[Bears]</a>: We need to make sure that those units are permanent to the best extent possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4797.228s">[Bears]</a>: And I want to turn it over to Councilor Morell, who I believe spoke to the administration and has some updates as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5206.374s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5208.015s">[Bears]</a>: Just a point of information, which is that even if we were to do a moratorium because of how Chapter 40B is written, these projects could move forward anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5215.379s">[Bears]</a>: So that's kind of the crux of the issue here, is we need to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5219.98s">[Bears]</a>: That that if we did a moratorium then and then we could still get 40 B applications in that move through the process outside of our zoning and height and design restrictions and whatnot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5229.111s">[Bears]</a>: So so that's part of the point is I think we need to get to that safe harbor point where 40 B is not the threat that it is right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5278.305s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know if that's, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5282.507s">[Bears]</a>: Somerville was at their 10% safe harbor threshold, so they couldn't get 40B the way that we can, being under that percentage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5733.683s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5735.484s">[Bears]</a>: So I think there's two issues here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5737.366s">[Bears]</a>: One is let me preface this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5740.168s">[Bears]</a>: So the issue here is that the council should have the ability to have its own legal services for a variety of reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5747.254s">[Bears]</a>: I think in just permanently I think it's important for the council to have that resource so that we can get legal opinions and have legal services independent of the executive branch of the city administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5760.305s">[Bears]</a>: I think that will be always permanent but also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5763.877s">[Bears]</a>: I think the current circumstances facing the city bring us to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5769.946s">[Bears]</a>: I won't say a unique point but kind of we're coming to a head with the amount of ordinances and other work that we're going to need to do especially as a council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5778.269s">[Bears]</a>: And also we know the city solicitors currently enacting city solicitors so there is a process to hire a permanent city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5785.232s">[Bears]</a>: So I think there's both good reasons at all times why the council should have legal services and also very important reasons at this moment as to why the council should have legal services and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5797.108s">[Bears]</a>: My motion on the issue would be that we make sure to add it to the future agenda of our committee of the whole meeting with the mayor, which I believe is forthcoming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5808.052s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5823.637s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5823.957s">[Bears]</a>: And that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1307.968s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1696.539s">[Bears]</a>: So what I have here, if Councilor Caraviello would be so amenable, we have a motion to refer this to Committee of the Whole to meet with the city administration, you know, residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1706.922s">[Bears]</a>: And Councilor Caraviello, prior to that, you had an amendment to change it to the person who received the next most votes would fill any vacancy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1713.464s">[Bears]</a>: Would you mind if we discuss that and Councilor Knight's discussion on Chapter 43B at the Committee of the Whole?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1720.026s">[Bears]</a>: Great, so that's the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1721.566s">[Bears]</a>: I'm seeing Chief of Staff Nina Nazarian, and then at this point, seeing no other comments from Councilors, if members of the public would like to line up here or raise their hands on Zoom for comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1731.348s">[Bears]</a>: But first, Chief of Staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2889.955s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, it is the universal discrimination of government, and it's slow processes, and I apologize for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3032.156s">[Bears]</a>: About the solvent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3068.988s">[Bears]</a>: I personally think the solution should be that we should buy little boots for all the pets, but that's just me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3230.919s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, 70 from resume the negative the motion passes 22 dash 066 offered by President morale, be it so resolved that the Medford City Council request that the administration deploy temporary signage as needed, noting so emergency parking procedures throughout the city, President morale.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3304.685s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, President morale, any further discussion, Councilor Caraviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3613.985s">[Bears]</a>: Just before we go to Councilor Collins, I just want to add, you can actually fill out a form on the city website to automatically sign up for those alerts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3620.088s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3720.103s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, just as one councillor, this language is pretty open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3725.226s">[Bears]</a>: I was actually thinking when this was going up, it would be more like when we had the Craddock Bridge project,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3730.672s">[Bears]</a>: You know, the traffic sign that said go here, go there, go everywhere for a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3734.977s">[Bears]</a>: And in addition, you know, we have these super boards and major squares, those could go up, those are, you know, tall and generally at least most of the time over the height of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3744.403s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, you know, the billboards as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3746.344s">[Bears]</a>: So, cause I do, I do think there's a gap where new residents, you know, don't know the procedures of the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3752.187s">[Bears]</a>: And the real issue that I've seen is that, you know, we have a lot of signage on most of our streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3758.01s">[Bears]</a>: This is not one of the things that's signed on those streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3760.391s">[Bears]</a>: So if someone parks on the street, then they look up at the sign next to their street, this isn't on there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3765.533s">[Bears]</a>: So that's kind of, you know, and I'm not saying we should go replace 10,000 signs on every block.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3769.255s">[Bears]</a>: Cause we know that what kind of project that would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3771.676s">[Bears]</a>: But if we get some temporary solutions in, and then maybe as well, going forward, if we're redoing a street, look at the signage on that street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3780.24s">[Bears]</a>: That might help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3780.94s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3826.189s">[Bears]</a>: Sorry, temporarily, generally explore temporary and permanent solutions to close communication gaps regarding snow emergencies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3837.757s">[Bears]</a>: President Morales that amendment acceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3865.461s">[Bears]</a>: Here's a riddle for you, Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3866.621s">[Bears]</a>: If it's December 2020, is it even parking lot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3872.563s">[Bears]</a>: Is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3942.994s">[Bears]</a>: And you know, if anyone from DCR is listening, please turn your plows to the left on Fells Way West.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3949.378s">[Bears]</a>: We're going east on Fells Way West, turn your plows to the left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3953.16s">[Bears]</a>: You know, just right between 621 and 629, that would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3955.622s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Caraviello?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3967.599s">[Bears]</a>: Oh, it looks like Miss Catalo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3970.445s">[Bears]</a>: Actually, Mr. Castagnetti first, then we'll go to Miss Catalo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4491.749s">[Bears]</a>: I think that's gone so emotionally Council Collins to approve second by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4495.291s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, Councilor Knight second by Councilor councilor night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4625.3s">[Bears]</a>: Where are we with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4626.84s">[Bears]</a>: We have not received to my knowledge, unless the clerk has information otherwise, an appropriation request from the mayor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4636.704s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, that may be possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4638.825s">[Bears]</a>: And I say, we can't do it on our own.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4688.851s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4689.911s">[Bears]</a>: On the matter of the appropriation, I don't think anyone in this, well, I'll speak for myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4693.813s">[Bears]</a>: I was certainly not opposed to adding money to that pot, but I just believe procedurally, if it was gonna come before us, it has to come from the mayor as an appropriation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4705.157s">[Bears]</a>: If she can do it herself, that's another matter, but I certainly know we can't initiate that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4712.84s">[Bears]</a>: She seems to have stepped out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4714.621s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Caraviello to approve,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4719.611s">[Bears]</a>: Any other discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4721.693s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4746.707s">[Bears]</a>: 22-068 offered by Councilor Tseng be resolved that the Metro City Council as the city of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4751.673s">[Bears]</a>: City Administration and the Office of Planning, Sustainability, and Development to study and reach out to potential locations for public art projects like murals and to publish these locations on the city website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4762.437s">[Bears]</a>: These locations should also keep in mind potential problems of equity, gentrification, and access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4766.559s">[Bears]</a>: Be it further resolved that the Medford City Council asks the City Administration and the Office of Planning, Sustainability, and Development to create online and physical forms where members of the community and business owners can express their interest in taking part in public arts projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4778.784s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4882.827s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion of Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4886.37s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4887.11s">[Bears]</a>: Oh, Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4900.529s">[Bears]</a>: You said you could say thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4903.451s">[Bears]</a>: No, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4905.312s">[Bears]</a>: As an artist, I believe he meant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4953.942s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4956.422s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion of Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5035.609s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5036.209s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5038.051s">[Bears]</a>: Whereas this would be an amendment to the marijuana zoning ordinance, my preference here, the intent of this ordinance is to ensure that both the construction and staffing of marijuana establishments here in our community, whether they are dispensaries or they are, you know, many of the other variety of marijuana companies that may come here are providing good union jobs that are providing good wages to the people of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5064.944s">[Bears]</a>: And, you know, whereas this was a change to our zoning, I would like to motion to join this with paper 20-568 and refer it to committee of the whole to get information, you know, discuss this maybe after we discuss the community development board recommendations tomorrow, to discuss this with attorney Dabrowski and see if this is a potential way forward to ensure labor, supportive labor in the marijuana industry here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5092.486s">[Bears]</a>: And I also know after discussion with my fellow Councilors, there is Mr. Gabriel Camacho, representative of UFCW Local 1445 is with us on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5138.444s">[Bears]</a>: The provisions were, I can't speak for the UFCW, maybe if they, if Mr. Camacho is on the line, if he could discuss whether this came from council or not, I would like to have it reviewed by, at least by Attorney Bobrowski as well, just to, you know, I think our marijuana ordinance with the zoning ordinance piece and also the separate Cannabis Advisory Committee piece, you know, it may be a unique structure compared to other communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5164.283s">[Bears]</a>: So is Mr. Camacho on the line?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5455.961s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5457.162s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5457.922s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, and you know, I really want to thank Mr. Camacho and UFCW Local 1445.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5463.304s">[Bears]</a>: I know that I have some friends who have worked in the industry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5467.586s">[Bears]</a>: Their place of employment was able to unionize with UFCW Local 1445 and they have a much improved standard of working conditions and they're much happier in their positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5478.411s">[Bears]</a>: So my hope is that we can make sure that is how the industry works here in Medford as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5484.493s">[Bears]</a>: with Councilor Nides second, you know, happy to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5526.79s">[Bears]</a>: For sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5527.41s">[Bears]</a>: And I'm hoping that Attorney Brasco will review it as well as Solicitor Stantlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5559.665s">[Bears]</a>: I would have no issue with the future motion to sever this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5562.487s">[Bears]</a>: I just felt, you know, given that I feel like it's- Right, given that it's in the spirit of the council, given that we're already having the meeting with the attorney and given that, you know, we have the ability to amend the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5576.597s">[Bears]</a>: Well, my motion was to join it with paper 20-568, which is- Which one is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5581.561s">[Bears]</a>: That's the paper we're using for zoning recodification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5584.423s">[Bears]</a>: So my motion was to send this to committee of the whole and join it with 20-568.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5598.472s">[Bears]</a>: Well, I mean, to be honest, to be frank, I think, I think, I think, given, given the paper, I mean, to be honest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5607.401s">[Bears]</a>: given that it's an amendment to the zoning ordinance, I would feel comfortable bringing the text tomorrow night to discuss under the zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5614.023s">[Bears]</a>: So if we refer it to committee, the whole, you know, I would, I was putting this on so we could have a discussion tonight and have it in open council and also have the ability to separate in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5623.846s">[Bears]</a>: But I also think it's, it is an amendment to the zoning ordinance where tomorrow night we're discussing amendments to the zoning ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5631.008s">[Bears]</a>: We haven't, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5632.728s">[Bears]</a>: For example, when we were doing committees of the whole in last year, we weren't saying we're only discussing this section tonight and this section tonight and this section tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5640.932s">[Bears]</a>: It was the full zoning ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5642.213s">[Bears]</a>: So, you know, that's, I'm not trying to, I'm not trying to get around anything here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5689.595s">[Bears]</a>: If I may, if we were to, you know, if we were to review the meeting notice for tomorrow evening, let's say paper 20-568 zoning recodification, you know, and reviewing amendments to the zoning ordinance, I think that this would fall under that, that posting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5708.066s">[Bears]</a>: So, you know, I'm happy to refer to Committee of the Whole, not join it with the other paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5712.328s">[Bears]</a>: If we want to have another meeting on in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5714.53s">[Bears]</a>: I'm still going to bring it up tomorrow night, whether or not you know that that's just what I'm going to do in the committee the whole meeting either way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5734.727s">[Bears]</a>: That's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5735.527s">[Bears]</a>: That's coming up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5754.987s">[Bears]</a>: No, no, no motion to join.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5756.108s">[Bears]</a>: Just motion to send this to Committee of the Whole as it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5777.363s">[Bears]</a>: Sure, yeah, I mean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5788.73s">[Bears]</a>: Well, so, okay, here's my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5791.909s">[Bears]</a>: To be honest, my goal here was not to have an entirely separate committee, the whole meeting, because it's one amendment in the context of many amendments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5799.916s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think it needs an hour and a half of a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5803.059s">[Bears]</a>: So I'm happy to refer it, either to keep it, table it here, pending a legal opinion, and then we can discuss it when the public hearing reopens on the zoning recodification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5811.247s">[Bears]</a>: I'm happy to refer it to committee of the whole, and then have it, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5818.671s">[Bears]</a>: I'm in a motion to accept your amendment to have a legal opinion and then table it on the council agenda pending that legal opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5847.461s">[Bears]</a>: My question would be that we ask that the city solicitor and attorney Bobrowski both render an opinion as to whether this is permissible under Massachusetts zoning laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5860.131s">[Bears]</a>: And then secondly, if you know what you were saying Councilor Caraviello a motion to have a legal opinion from the city solicitor as to whether this affects ongoing negotiations with applicants to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5877.004s">[Bears]</a>: And again my one second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5906.243s">[Bears]</a>: Right, and again, the intent here is this would apply- And again, I don't have a problem supporting it, just- No, I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5917.35s">[Bears]</a>: I just wanna be clear, the reason that I put it under the zoning ordinance is because that's referring to host community agreements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5922.333s">[Bears]</a>: Right now, there's only one host community agreement being negotiated, so it may apply to the dispensaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5927.216s">[Bears]</a>: But the other thing here is that this could apply to the non-dispensary projects, which there are many marijuana businesses that we are allowing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5936.081s">[Bears]</a>: I believe, at least under a less restrictive process than the dispensary process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6146.036s">[Bears]</a>: Motion to table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6163.677s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6228.935s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6230.416s">[Bears]</a>: These bills are all on a similar topic which is the accountability of large tax exempt institutions to municipalities here in the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6241.065s">[Bears]</a>: The first bill is H3080 and S1874 are regarding allowing local municipalities to set up a regulatory framework and require that large tax exempt institutions with values over $15 million excluding religious institutions can be required to pay up to 25% of what they would otherwise pay in property taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6264.009s">[Bears]</a>: The second bill H 3803 would have, I believe the Department of Revenue, study and examine, or maybe the Division of Local Services, examine how much municipal tax revenue is lost every year to large tax exempt institutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6283.078s">[Bears]</a>: And the third bill is something this council has already voted through as a home roll petition, but still has not passed due to the objection of ACUM and the private college and university lobby, which is requiring an institutional master plan from Tufts University.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6299.524s">[Bears]</a>: So these three bills, again, I believe all three of them survive joint roll 10 day and have extensions in their committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6306.927s">[Bears]</a>: So it would be great if,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6309.088s">[Bears]</a>: the state would allow us to over the objections of these, you know, very high paid lobbyists for these large private institutions allow cities and towns to adequately plan for and regulate and cooperate and collaborate with large tax exempt institutions, like large universities and hospital systems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6330.984s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6476.662s">[Bears]</a>: This William you know I hadn't actually thought about this way before but the way that this is structured it would be a maximum 25% on what they would otherwise pay in property taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6485.173s">[Bears]</a>: Now, looking at the city's, you know, tax classification that's probably less than what the display is between land and buildings, but it is kind of similarly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6832.777s">[Bears]</a>: If they let us do our job, I wouldn't be filing these resolutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6894.393s">[Bears]</a>: I remember probably like my third meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6898.896s">[Bears]</a>: I tried to vote present on something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6900.377s">[Bears]</a>: I got, I got told I couldn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6909.112s">[Bears]</a>: 22-071 offered by Councilor Collins, whereas the Governor's fiscal year 2023 state budget proposal includes a 2.7% increase in unrestricted general government aid, and whereas this modest increase in local aid is disproportionate to the dramatic forecasted increase in 2023 state tax collections, 22% increase from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6929.13s">[Bears]</a>: original FY22 base and 7.3% increase from calculation of base used to create the FY22 budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6936.371s">[Bears]</a>: And whereas municipalities such as ours rely on state revenue sharing to balance local budgets and fund essential services, and as we contend with the ongoing pandemic recovery in the midst of economic inflation, these resources are needed as acutely as ever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6949.733s">[Bears]</a>: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council express its support for a higher level of unrestricted general government aid in the fiscal year 2023 state budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6955.875s">[Bears]</a>: Be it further resolved that the city clerk forward a copy of this resolution<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6959.144s">[Bears]</a>: to the Medford legislative delegation as well as Senate President Spoka and House Speaker Mariano, Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7055.724s">[Bears]</a>: Motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7059.865s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7113.032s">[Bears]</a>: I like voting last.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7123.136s">[Bears]</a>: 22-072 offered by councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7125.057s">[Bears]</a>: Whereas in February, 2020, the Medford city council, Medford school committee and mayor pledged to make our city hunger free by 2028.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7132.119s">[Bears]</a>: And whereas the pandemic conditions of the past two years has exacerbated hunger and food insecurity in Medford as in surrounding communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7139.662s">[Bears]</a>: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council reaffirm the pledge to make our city hunger-free by 2028.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7143.564s">[Bears]</a>: Be it further resolved that the Medford City Council express support for expanding the city's capacity to address food insecurity, development of convenient and affordable food sources throughout Medford, and targeting our pandemic recovery resources towards ensuring that our community's basic needs are met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7157.613s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7501.513s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. President, I have a paper that's related to that requesting a legal opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7504.497s">[Bears]</a>: On that motion, Mr. Clerk, please spell the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7517.38s">[Bears]</a>: We will take it up after this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7816.462s">[Bears]</a>: We don't have a specific chapter or section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7863.094s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7864.895s">[Bears]</a>: My ruling is that it's an order with four votes, so unless there's a motion to count, my ruling is to chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7908.729s">[Bears]</a>: Well, considering that this council, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8144.271s">[Bears]</a>: My reason, as Councilor Morell, if the sponsor of the paper does not want to move forward, then I'm comfortable keeping this or reverting, you know, if there's a motion to put these back on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1508.556s">[Bears]</a>: Just two quick questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1510.458s">[Bears]</a>: First, how does, you mentioned personal protective equipment and some other stuff, what ways does the Governor's declaration of a state of emergency affect how we were preparing up until this afternoon when he declared it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1524.547s">[Bears]</a>: Or just in general.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1525.928s">[Bears]</a>: You mentioned PPE as one example, is there other?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1567.018s">[Bears]</a>: So, but just the declaration of emergency is an indication of more resources coming to help, not necessarily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1587.409s">[Bears]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1587.929s">[Bears]</a>: Um, and then, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1589.955s">[Bears]</a>: have you discussed or tomorrow are you planning to discuss any guidance for public bodies in terms of meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1597.098s">[Bears]</a>: So we're all here right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1598.939s">[Bears]</a>: Other committees and groups meet as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4087.249s">[Bears]</a>: So we recently created the OPEB Fund Board of Trustees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4093.034s">[Bears]</a>: One of the seats on that board of trustees is an elected representative of the retirees of the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4100.66s">[Bears]</a>: I'm requesting that the city administration notify retirees by mail of the nomination deadline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4104.984s">[Bears]</a>: However, I was informed by the administration that the nomination deadline has changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4108.727s">[Bears]</a>: It is no longer March 16th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4111.55s">[Bears]</a>: Do you have a specific date, Dave?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4141.448s">[Bears]</a>: That would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4142.989s">[Bears]</a>: And then, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4145.064s">[Bears]</a>: The date would be great, but either way the motion that maybe we can strike the date from the motion and just say notify retirees by mail of the nomination deadline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4152.669s">[Bears]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4159.314s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4159.754s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4167.499s">[Bears]</a>: Just strike the words March 16th and just say retirees by mail of the nomination deadline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4652.373s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4654.834s">[Bears]</a>: I wanted to add that I definitely support clarification of the rules based on the opinion and also generally going through the rules and reviewing them for making sure that they're aligned with the law, modernized, and clear to the public to read.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4669.737s">[Bears]</a>: So replacing Shiles with Musper, we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4672.197s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5264.182s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5265.243s">[Bears]</a>: I just wanted to say thank you to Councilor Knight for directing this, and that I strongly support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5270.584s">[Bears]</a>: In my past, I was a federal employee, and I believe we had a similar program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5275.185s">[Bears]</a>: And I also know that the state has that same program, and it's incredibly helpful and important to folks who are going through difficult extended illnesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5283.406s">[Bears]</a>: So I strongly support this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5284.527s">[Bears]</a>: And again, thank you and support the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5685.834s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5687.114s">[Bears]</a>: I think assessing our rules, making sure they're good definitions, strong definitions and processes are important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5694.956s">[Bears]</a>: One, whatever the point of action is going forward, I think part of the conversation for me would be on making, addressing rule 33, which is what is the rule that addresses the structure of council agendas and kind of aligning out with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5707.98s">[Bears]</a>: And then also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5710.76s">[Bears]</a>: making sure we have clear definitions of public participation as relates to the council rules and also that those are clearly explained to the public through the city website and other means.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5722.243s">[Bears]</a>: And just making sure that we are providing equal public participation to what we provide now, I think is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5728.845s">[Bears]</a>: So as discussion goes forward, I think it's important to keep those things in mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6216.107s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. President, I'd like to amend the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6219.028s">[Bears]</a>: If it's still going to be moved for approval, I'd like to amend it or add a B paper that at a future committee of the whole meeting, we review the rules for public participation and review the order of the agenda pursuant to rule 33.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6231.453s">[Bears]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6231.733s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6238.643s">[Bears]</a>: Sure that we review any rules pursuant to public participation and also that we review and update rule 33 which outlines the Order of how we address things on the council agenda Yes, yes committee the whole correct<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6260.174s">[Bears]</a>: And it could be the same committee of the whole as rules review in general.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6264.698s">[Bears]</a>: Get it done all at once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7980.114s">[Bears]</a>: just want to echo, uh, my colleagues and send my condolences to the Morse family and, uh, thank all members of the Morse family for their continuing service to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7989.461s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8160.211s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you to Councilor Knight again for putting forward this proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8167.432s">[Bears]</a>: The organization that I run was part of the Raise Up Mass Coalition that passed the Fight for 15 law here in Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8174.594s">[Bears]</a>: And sadly, due to how the state constitution and state laws work, we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8179.958s">[Bears]</a>: exempted municipalities from that because it's technically an unfunded mandate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8183.399s">[Bears]</a>: So I think it's really important that Medford steps up and says that we're going to follow along with what the state minimum wage is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8189.701s">[Bears]</a>: And I also think just from the clear purposes of making sure we can hire folks, if you can make $3, $4, $5 more an hour, go work at Subway or some other organization or group rather than working for the city, that's going to present a problem now and down the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8202.566s">[Bears]</a>: So I think it's incredibly important both from a justice perspective and from a practical hiring perspective that we do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8663.574s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8665.176s">[Bears]</a>: Some of the many of the concerns of Councilor Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8669.161s">[Bears]</a>: I also think we need to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8671.556s">[Bears]</a>: make sure that we're not either implying or otherwise that any projects under consideration might be contingent on something like this moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8678.799s">[Bears]</a>: I wouldn't support this in that case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8683.301s">[Bears]</a>: If we're going to move forward with it, I would propose an amendment that the parking that's created have pervious surfaces, permeable surfaces, allowing water to come through and not becoming another asphalt where water is potentially causing flooding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8697.827s">[Bears]</a>: So that's the first part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8701.451s">[Bears]</a>: make sure that if parking's installed, there's protection for mature trees, making sure that code enforcement or the city or whoever's responsible for the buffer strips, that they are sufficient and maintained well, and then also limiting it to one spot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8729.007s">[Bears]</a>: And then limiting the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8756.778s">[Bears]</a>: And limiting to one spot, you've got that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8759.319s">[Bears]</a>: Limiting to one spot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8764.3s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9262.567s">[Bears]</a>: I strongly support moving forward as quickly as possible as well as we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9267.37s">[Bears]</a>: Four years out now almost since the ballot question in 2016 that started this whole process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9272.673s">[Bears]</a>: I do have one kind of question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9275.355s">[Bears]</a>: Are we able to amend this to say that this meeting should happen within the next month or is that a... All right, then no need for an amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9285.581s">[Bears]</a>: Great, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=11065.007s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=11065.927s">[Bears]</a>: I want to commend Patrick and the membership of Medford Community Media.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=11069.869s">[Bears]</a>: And I'd like to make a motion to receive this and place it on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=11143.634s">[Bears]</a>: Motion to adjourn, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1487.466s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1488.987s">[Bears]</a>: Just that I think Derek said it very well and Councilor Marks as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1492.629s">[Bears]</a>: I'm supportive of some of the ideas around this, but I want to see it happen as part of a larger process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1798.332s">[Bears]</a>: Just if President Falco or Councilor Knight, do you know where we are on the ticking clock on this zoning change?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1805.277s">[Bears]</a>: Is there a date?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1824.767s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1825.407s">[Bears]</a>: And both taking COGS legal and just, we need to get this done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1828.31s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2625.757s">[Bears]</a>: Something should come up on your screen when he presses the button that says unmute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2629.18s">[Bears]</a>: There you go, you're unmuted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3118.789s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4536.458s">[Bears]</a>: Second, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4547.455s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4677.215s">[Bears]</a>: Second, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5315.427s">[Bears]</a>: Second, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7119.09s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=10941.773s">[Bears]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11535.676s">[Bears]</a>: I just want to add that I fully support this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11537.838s">[Bears]</a>: I'm a neighbor down the street on Fellsway West, and we need safer crossings on Elm Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12070.206s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12071.587s">[Bears]</a>: I bring this resolution before the council today at the request of hundreds of residents who've asked that we hang a Black Lives Matter banner on Medford City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12080.072s">[Bears]</a>: This moment of uprising and reckoning with our history of white supremacy and racism demands it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12086.795s">[Bears]</a>: As my fellow councilors and the public know, many communities have placed similar banners on schools, town halls, and other city buildings to show solidarity, respect, and support<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12095.285s">[Bears]</a>: for the movement to address the ongoing structural racism that has been tearing families and communities apart in this country for centuries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12101.748s">[Bears]</a>: We've seen protests and demonstrations for Black lives in our community, thousands of people standing up in person, online, through lawn signs and conversations to say no more, to say that we will not sweep this under the rug or treat this as a side issue when we know we can't move forward as a nation, as a community, or as a human family without permanent transformative change on the issues of structural racism and economic inequity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12124.42s">[Bears]</a>: I expect we will have a robust discussion tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12127.562s">[Bears]</a>: I hope it does not include any conspiracy theories that have been being forwarded around about this being some sort of fundraising front for the Democratic Party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12135.268s">[Bears]</a>: And I also expect to hear the need to take action and not just say more words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12139.912s">[Bears]</a>: And the assertion that this is about symbolism and not about substance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12144.475s">[Bears]</a>: I would agree that it's about time that we dive deeply into charter review, rethinking how we elect elected officials in an all at large way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12152.507s">[Bears]</a>: that diminishes racial representation and has been struck down by courts in other Massachusetts communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12158.111s">[Bears]</a>: I would agree that it's about time that we transform our city zoning and really root out the history of racial bias and zoning that permeated the zoning process when zoning was last reviewed in the city decades ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12168.839s">[Bears]</a>: Action is necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12170.32s">[Bears]</a>: These are urgent projects on the path of transformation and they will take time, but words matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12175.884s">[Bears]</a>: Words matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12177.705s">[Bears]</a>: What we say matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12179.286s">[Bears]</a>: How we convey our support to the community matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12181.738s">[Bears]</a>: And I hope that by saying these words, we spur ourselves to take on the bigger things that we have to do as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12186.923s">[Bears]</a>: We know, and we've heard from Black parents and children and grandparents and brothers and sisters and neighbors and friends, from our neighbors and friends and residents of color, that this community has caused harm, that many have felt exclusion and disillusion and persecution in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12202.499s">[Bears]</a>: I can never understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12204.568s">[Bears]</a>: But when I try to even imagine the thousand stabs and paper cuts that our coworkers, neighbors, and friends of color experience on a daily basis, I can't begin to describe the horror that I feel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12216.55s">[Bears]</a>: And I want every black parent, every child of color, every person in this community to know and to see when they walk by our city hall, the seat of power in this community, that we stand with them, that we hear them, that we will listen to them, talk to them,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12232.011s">[Bears]</a>: and empower them to lead this fight and fight alongside them, undaunted and undeterred.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12237.012s">[Bears]</a>: If my best friend experiences racist treatment, which I've seen over and over when we've been together, and then drives by our city hall, I want him to look up and see that we know that his life matters and that we are working to make that truly alive and real for everyone who calls Medford home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12254.458s">[Bears]</a>: I wanna look up and know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12256.578s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. President, that's why I put forward this resolution<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12259.246s">[Bears]</a>: why I and many others think this is a necessary and overdue step, and why I ask for my colleague's support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12264.67s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12843.735s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12844.656s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I was actually going to make a similar point that there have been a variety of banners with co-logoed with the city and private organizations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12853.843s">[Bears]</a>: So I'm not sure what the policy is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12855.264s">[Bears]</a>: I'm certainly interested to see what the policy is, just specifically on the First Amendment argument and the idea that the city hall could become a billboard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12862.589s">[Bears]</a>: The First Amendment is designed to protect<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12866.474s">[Bears]</a>: citizens of the United States, and it's incorporated to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts through the 14th Amendment, from the government interfering with the private right to communicate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12875.676s">[Bears]</a>: The government has not offered City Hall as a billboard to anyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12880.057s">[Bears]</a>: It's not that any citizen could just come and apply to put whatever banner up that they want, as far as I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12885.499s">[Bears]</a>: So if such a process were to be initiated, then there may be First Amendment concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12890.04s">[Bears]</a>: But if the city itself is deciding what messages to put out on city property,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12895.563s">[Bears]</a>: and not an open input for, you know, it's not a bulletin board, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12900.226s">[Bears]</a>: That's the difference in the First Amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12902.288s">[Bears]</a>: The city has a complete right to put messages up on city property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12905.85s">[Bears]</a>: It doesn't have the right to infringe on private property and, well, it doesn't have the right to infringe on the residents' use of their free speech or freedom of expression.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13190.252s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, just a couple of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13191.952s">[Bears]</a>: I hear you, I'm sure there are thousands of spurious lawsuits filed all the time, judicial watches,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13199.403s">[Bears]</a>: well known as an organization of files, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13201.264s">[Bears]</a>: I understand, though, that lawsuits can be filed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13204.424s">[Bears]</a>: I would just say, I don't think there should be a permitting process for putting banners up on City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13208.626s">[Bears]</a>: I think that would create the problems that are being brought up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13211.366s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think this is a slippery slope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13214.127s">[Bears]</a>: There have been banners hung on the building for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13216.568s">[Bears]</a>: And I would just add that if the council doesn't want to be the banner approval authority, then it's on the councilors not to introduce a lot of resolutions about banners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13225.23s">[Bears]</a>: So that's all I'll say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13226.29s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13227.791s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13296.587s">[Bears]</a>: I don't disagree that we should have a policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13298.167s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just saying that if we created an open permit, then we get into these First Amendment questions, which we're currently not facing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13304.264s">[Bears]</a>: However, the mayor would like to approach this, I'm happy with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13307.506s">[Bears]</a>: And personally, I would be fine if we hung a Black Lives Matter banner on every municipal building in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13448.638s">[Bears]</a>: It would be that we suggest or ask the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13492.143s">[Bears]</a>: I believe that given the fact that, as we've already been told and said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13496.344s">[Bears]</a>: The mayor has control over the building that functionally the language as existing serves as a suggestion to the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13524.226s">[Bears]</a>: I'm saying that we will do this, and then it would be, you know, the mayor is the one who makes that choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13529.71s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you for the clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14749.477s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14749.837s">[Bears]</a>: Just a short message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14751.478s">[Bears]</a>: I just want to read from the letter from the Birmingham jail by Dr. King, which is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14756.277s">[Bears]</a>: I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride towards freedom is not the white citizen's Councilor or the Ku Klux Klan-er, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to order than to justice, who prefers a negative peace, which is the absence of tension, to a positive peace, which is the presence of justice, and who constantly says, I agree with you and the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14777.154s">[Bears]</a>: So let's not talk about Dr. King in such a way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14780.216s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15902.993s">[Bears]</a>: Very quickly, this is not in any way an attempt to divide the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15906.934s">[Bears]</a>: I think what's dividing the city is decades, if not centuries of unaddressed discrimination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15912.275s">[Bears]</a>: This is an attempt to heal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15913.795s">[Bears]</a>: I can't say it any better than Grace about how important this is to so many people that we do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15917.876s">[Bears]</a>: So let's do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15919.016s">[Bears]</a>: This is the action we can take.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15920.337s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16964.417s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. President, I moved approval and got a second from Councilor Morell at the beginning of this discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16974.482s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16977.331s">[Bears]</a>: I so move, and then I said I so move, and then Councilor Morell said second, and then I believe the chair acknowledged the second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17061.053s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, I accept the ruling of the chair, but I think if we watch the recording, we'll see that Councilor Morell said that she seconds the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17177.967s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. President, I'd like to move to amend to ask the clerk to check the recording to see if this motion is in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17240.129s">[Bears]</a>: That's fine, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17241.21s">[Bears]</a>: I'm not gonna challenge your ruling once again, because I know I'll lose, but I will bring it up when we discuss the records next month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17246.393s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17249.155s">[Bears]</a>: There's no Mr. Ripley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17252.819s">[Bears]</a>: So there is there is truth and truth and falsehood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17391.335s">[Bears]</a>: Could you reread the motion, Mr. Clerk?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17490.687s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17492.839s">[Bears]</a>: As we're aware, we're in the midst of a global pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17495.94s">[Bears]</a>: The governor of the Commonwealth has abdicated his responsibility to provide clear guidelines for both elementary and secondary education, as well as our institutions of higher learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17505.845s">[Bears]</a>: So I have heard from many residents who are deeply concerned about the reopening plan that's been proposed by Tufts University.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17512.968s">[Bears]</a>: I do want to also mention that the mayor and the mayor's office has sent a letter to President Monaco at Tufts and also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17520.987s">[Bears]</a>: that the mayor has received a response to that letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17524.288s">[Bears]</a>: So there has been some communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17527.449s">[Bears]</a>: I would like to ask either if Chief of Staff Rodriguez has anything quickly now or in a written update that we get information on exactly how the mayor and the health director were consulted by the university.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17541.573s">[Bears]</a>: Was there an approval process that the city had to approve the reopening plan or not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17546.234s">[Bears]</a>: What did that consultation look like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17548.979s">[Bears]</a>: I think the big unanswered question, which is what happens if there is an outbreak or, you know, what happens if this doesn't go the way that Tufts is expecting it to go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17558.645s">[Bears]</a>: I spoke with Rocco DiRico.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17560.846s">[Bears]</a>: He mentioned that, you know, he kind of outlined similarly to the response that was sent to the mayor, what their plan is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17569.192s">[Bears]</a>: I felt slightly better, but I would just say again that the uncertainty is so great that bringing this many people back seems<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17576.749s">[Bears]</a>: potentially unwise to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17578.03s">[Bears]</a>: So that's the intent of this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17728.369s">[Bears]</a>: Second, Councilor Knights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17729.329s">[Bears]</a>: Move to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17740.991s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. President, we have Laurel Ruma.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17834.951s">[Bears]</a>: Let's just get rid of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17836.792s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Knight moved to approve, and I seconded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18601.797s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. President, before we start, I just need to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18604.409s">[Bears]</a>: say something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18606.69s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18607.53s">[Bears]</a>: So at the previous meeting on this ordinance, I had recused myself as I was awaiting guidance from the State Ethics Commission on whether I could participate in these discussions due to an investment that I had in the Medford Brewing Company.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18620.555s">[Bears]</a>: I received guidance from the State Ethics Commission, which included that if I and my parents were both to divest our relatively small investments in the Medford Brewing Company, and then I were to file a disclosure with the clerk's office,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18633.919s">[Bears]</a>: that I would be able to participate in these discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18636.661s">[Bears]</a>: We have divested from our investments and I have filed said disclosure with the clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18640.424s">[Bears]</a>: So I will be participating going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18642.166s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20733.023s">[Bears]</a>: I just want to say thank you to Councilor Morell for proposing the amendment, and I strongly support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20739.945s">[Bears]</a>: I think this is exactly what Medford needs at this moment, and we shouldn't be standing in the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20744.686s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=21115.676s">[Bears]</a>: Motion to approve as amended, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=21168.137s">[Bears]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=21169.398s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=21171.498s">[Bears]</a>: Are we voting on the amendment or the motion to sever?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=21175.459s">[Bears]</a>: On the amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=21176.92s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=21178.953s">[Bears]</a>: To sever?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=21180.034s">[Bears]</a>: I vote on the motion to sever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=21246.894s">[Bears]</a>: Let's see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=21254.336s">[Bears]</a>: Motion to refer the paper as amended to the Community Development Board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=21290.126s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. President, motion to revert to the regular order of business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=21300.578s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=21535.522s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just, I'm just getting going Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22318.544s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Marks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22331.974s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22423.569s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. President, motion to waive the reading in favor of a brief synopsis from the petitioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22610.719s">[Bears]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22631.849s">[Bears]</a>: Motion to revert to the regular order of business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22713.804s">[Bears]</a>: I will be brief and then leave it to Councilor Morell and just say that this virus is unpredictable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22720.025s">[Bears]</a>: We are at a low case count in Massachusetts right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22722.286s">[Bears]</a>: That could change very quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22724.126s">[Bears]</a>: Given the fact that it's 1.20 in the morning and not many people are left paying attention, I would appreciate if the administration could give a written update along these lines as to whether or not they've considered reversing reopenings or slowing things down and share that with the council and with the public in a relatively timely manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22742.029s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22848.783s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22850.584s">[Bears]</a>: Pretty self-explanatory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22851.964s">[Bears]</a>: A West City website review was mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22854.525s">[Bears]</a>: I'd like it to be discussed with the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22857.426s">[Bears]</a>: It's also along the lines of a couple of resolutions that the council passed that I proposed, I think at our June 30th meeting regarding council communications and subcommittees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22866.79s">[Bears]</a>: So whether those could be back to back or in one meeting, whatever is preferable, I just think the topics are interrelated and something we should be taking a look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22875.674s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=23585.107s">[Bears]</a>: Most motion are received and placed on file, and make best efforts to schedule this promptly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=23608.299s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=23608.459s">[Bears]</a>: Well then just a motion that we make best efforts to schedule this promptly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=23636.554s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=23690.846s">[Bears]</a>: I found the records sufficient and precise, Mr. President, and I move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=220.365s">[Bears]</a>: Shane you good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2133.152s">[Bears]</a>: And we did have the tabled item regarding the crew team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2140.534s">[Bears]</a>: I'm thinking maybe we should just table both of them to the next regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2145.339s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2146.76s">[Bears]</a>: Crew team's already tabled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2148.001s">[Bears]</a>: All right, crew team's tabled, so we'll put that back on the next regular meeting agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2152.223s">[Bears]</a>: And then is there a motion to table Mr. Castagnetti's public participation item for the next regular meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2473.676s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2596.633s">[Bears]</a>: It was definitely the first bridge over the Mystic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2627.242s">[Bears]</a>: So, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2640.228s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2641.168s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, I appreciate the gesture to Larry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2644.33s">[Bears]</a>: We miss him every day, and we will figure out how to do it I just appreciate you bringing it in the form of a check and not cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2652.893s">[Bears]</a>: So that that helps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2672.287s">[Bears]</a>: just when I thought I was out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2674.088s">[Bears]</a>: I'm gonna go to Councilor Callahan who has requested the microphone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2677.59s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2696.44s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2697.22s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2698.921s">[Bears]</a>: Any further participation in the public participation section of the meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2702.83s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to go to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2704.111s">[Bears]</a>: We have Eunice Browne on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2705.411s">[Bears]</a>: Eunice, name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2753.873s">[Bears]</a>: Hi Eunice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2755.175s">[Bears]</a>: On the second question we have not yet received the report from the Charter Commission I think it's expected towards the end of the month or the beginning of next month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2763.526s">[Bears]</a>: for tomorrow night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2765.127s">[Bears]</a>: I honestly was unsure as to what was going to happen with the paper tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2769.508s">[Bears]</a>: So I didn't know if there'd be a lot of discussion about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2771.229s">[Bears]</a>: I didn't know if we'd want to move to another meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2773.57s">[Bears]</a>: I didn't know if there may be a motion to table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2776.05s">[Bears]</a>: So that's why we have the two meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2779.051s">[Bears]</a>: We approved it and it's been disposed with tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2780.992s">[Bears]</a>: So I don't expect that we will have the regular meeting tomorrow night, but we will have the committee of the whole on the tree ordinance at six o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2792.236s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2796.656s">[Bears]</a>: If anyone else would like to participate, please approach the podium or raise your hand on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2805.819s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, on the motion to adjourn by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2810.06s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2830.926s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2834.568s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=544.379s">[Bears]</a>: City Council and Committee of the Whole, November 20 2024 Mr. please call the roll Council Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=562.093s">[Bears]</a>: I present to absence meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=565.026s">[Bears]</a>: Action Discussions item 19-070.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=567.287s">[Bears]</a>: This is by Vice President Collins and Councilor Callahan on the Tree Ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=570.749s">[Bears]</a>: We have three drafts that we've been working on for quite a while as evidenced by the 19-070.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=576.171s">[Bears]</a>: That stands for 2019.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=577.352s">[Bears]</a>: So we have a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=581.923s">[Bears]</a>: public updates to the public tree ordinance in the city ordinance is currently the discussion of the creation of a tree committee and the proposed private tree ordinance, which would be relative to zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=596.788s">[Bears]</a>: We are joined today by our building commissioner, our DPW commissioner, representative of Trees Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=602.91s">[Bears]</a>: And I think I'm gonna turn it over to Councilor Callahan to talk through how we're going to move through this today, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=612.159s">[Bears]</a>: Oh, and before I said I do have to, I will read, or if trees meant for folks want to read their letter into the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=618.365s">[Bears]</a>: At some point later in the meeting I will read into the record, the letter from trees Medford, and the letter that we received from former Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=629.502s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=630.502s">[Bears]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=759.876s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks, I'm happy to read the letter, unless one of you guys wanna read the letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=766.018s">[Bears]</a>: All right, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=767.658s">[Bears]</a>: And then you'll share, after that, you'll share your screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=771.277s">[Bears]</a>: Do you want to read the, that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=774.098s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=775.138s">[Bears]</a>: You wrote it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=775.598s">[Bears]</a>: So I feel like you'll have a better feel on it than I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=783.48s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=947.705s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Amanda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=949.205s">[Bears]</a>: All right, I'll go to Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=979.232s">[Bears]</a>: So I believe that the red indicates a comment that preexisted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=986.174s">[Bears]</a>: And this is the blue indicates changes from the KP law draft to the draft submitted by the trees, Medford folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=997.116s">[Bears]</a>: So blue is new and black is something that was submitted by KP for the October 11th, 2023 meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1016.781s">[Bears]</a>: So the blue is all the stuff that you added.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1027.01s">[Bears]</a>: We just wanted to be able to see the difference between what you guys did and the KP law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1031.073s">[Bears]</a>: So the blue stuff is everything that you've added.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1033.415s">[Bears]</a>: And then it should also show lined removals as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1046.171s">[Bears]</a>: Generally, we go through section by section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1048.112s">[Bears]</a>: You can kind of note the changes, and then we can pause for further discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1061.263s">[Bears]</a>: I think summarizing the changes is generally what I like to do, but it's however you want to handle it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1072.472s">[Bears]</a>: I'm happy to do it, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1073.693s">[Bears]</a>: I've done it a few times, if you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1078.597s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, totally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1079.998s">[Bears]</a>: So it looks like here we have in the purpose section, just looks like there's an edit to quality of the city's environment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1092.668s">[Bears]</a>: And then it looks like there's a quote or kind of a section, a paragraph added.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1097.543s">[Bears]</a>: to summarize some changes under Mass General Law chapter 40A or authority provided under General Law 40A.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1107.206s">[Bears]</a>: I think we should talk, we can talk about that further, but just that might, we might want to constrain that paragraph to the private ordinance since that's the one that's going to be a zoning ordinance, but we can talk about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1119.83s">[Bears]</a>: And I'm interested to hear from building commissioner and the DPW commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1124.571s">[Bears]</a>: Under the appointments section, we have the committee shall consist of five Medford residents and up to 10 members total, subject to confirmation by the Council and added two youth members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1139.142s">[Bears]</a>: It looks like a change from the last draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1142.645s">[Bears]</a>: One member demonstrating expertise in the fields of urban forestry or landscape design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1148.589s">[Bears]</a>: Residency not required if requisite expertise is demonstrated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1154.423s">[Bears]</a>: And then there's just some minor changes to the initial terms, a few more minor changes to duties, but here under section 3A, it looks like there would be a differentiation with the creation of something called the landmark tree hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1173.788s">[Bears]</a>: Moving forward, it looks like some additional typographic and other language additions here in sections B,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1183.18s">[Bears]</a>: through I, I'm not seeing anything super major.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1190.064s">[Bears]</a>: Section J here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1191.245s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just going to pull up my draft because I'm not seeing what was removed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1201.652s">[Bears]</a>: It looks like a majority of this question under the duties has remained pretty consistent from the initial draft or from the draft from October 11, 2023 to now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1216.954s">[Bears]</a>: And I think that generally summarizes the changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1219.115s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know if Amanda, if you want to talk any more about what changed between the two drafts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1224.676s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1228.097s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1230.898s">[Bears]</a>: So it looks like the main differences are around the composition of the trade committee and some questions around youth membership and residency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1244.782s">[Bears]</a>: At this point,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1249.042s">[Bears]</a>: We could recognize either the DPW commissioner or the building commissioner if you have any comments on the tree committee ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1427.775s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Commissioner McGivern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1428.815s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, and I know that Robin Stein comment on the duties at this section three will be relatively dependent on what actually happens with that public tree ordinance changes as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1446.719s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1521.264s">[Bears]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1522.444s">[Bears]</a>: And I think as Attorney Stein noted, you know, we're subject to the Chapter 87<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1529.384s">[Bears]</a>: mass general laws around those authorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1532.145s">[Bears]</a>: And we can't, yeah, we just can't give away, like the Traffic Commission, for example, is actually defined by state law here, like the Medford Traffic Commission's authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1544.049s">[Bears]</a>: So just like tree wood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1545.67s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1546.63s">[Bears]</a>: And that's my just the kind of point I'm trying to push home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1551.152s">[Bears]</a>: But yeah, it sounds like for the tree committee, generally,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1554.969s">[Bears]</a>: be mostly working with DPW, maybe some language tweaks would be needed around support and advice, but specifics, the public tree ordinance as we look at the amendments there is going to inform some of that for here for the tree committee as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1569.953s">[Bears]</a>: Excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1570.533s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1570.954s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1572.554s">[Bears]</a>: So maybe we can move to, well, we can, do we have any more comments on the tree committee ordinance either in person here or on Zoom before we move on to the public?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1584.121s">[Bears]</a>: tree ordinance amendments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1586.765s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1668.083s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1671.105s">[Bears]</a>: And I will go to Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1724.225s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1726.506s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Calderon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1759.958s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1761.119s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1761.679s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1762.119s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1763.961s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1764.661s">[Bears]</a>: Let's move next to our public tree draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1770.785s">[Bears]</a>: If you wouldn't mind sharing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1772.126s">[Bears]</a>: Maybe I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1776.008s">[Bears]</a>: Maybe I can do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1781.232s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1786.65s">[Bears]</a>: Do you want to go for it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2204.858s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, thank you, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2206.359s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2207.961s">[Bears]</a>: It's pretty, some pretty significant changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2210.022s">[Bears]</a>: So I'm wondering, Commissioner McGivern, what your thoughts are and where we might want to go from here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2366.623s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2367.464s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2369.638s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I think we're going to need to have this track changes draft brought to you probably to KP as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2377.005s">[Bears]</a>: I think there's some comments from Attorney Stein around enforcement in here already, but I'm going to go to Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2408.048s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2408.308s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2684.121s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli and appreciate your comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2687.744s">[Bears]</a>: I definitely think that a next step out of this meeting is going to be to refer these two relevant department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2695.111s">[Bears]</a>: I think for the public tree ordinance going to the DPW, for the private tree ordinance going to both our building commissioner, as well as the, it's a zoning ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2703.779s">[Bears]</a>: So what its interfaces with the zoning updates project that we're working on, I think is going to be important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2709.544s">[Bears]</a>: and that three committee ordinance is going to be relatively determinant based on where we land on this public ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2725.312s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you and good luck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2727.693s">[Bears]</a>: All right, thanks buddy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2733.336s">[Bears]</a>: Great, so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2735.447s">[Bears]</a>: With that, do we want to take a look at the private ordinance then we can look at some motions or I'll go to you Councilor Kelly at first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2780.735s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2782.256s">[Bears]</a>: First, Scott, do you see any engagement from your office on the public tree ordinance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2788.642s">[Bears]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2789.643s">[Bears]</a>: And Tim, do you think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2793.783s">[Bears]</a>: you know, obviously your comments on this draft are gonna be incredibly important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2797.304s">[Bears]</a>: Do you think that you could do some sort of kind of cost estimate as to what you think trying to fully implement this would look like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2803.405s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know, or general estimate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2837.688s">[Bears]</a>: great thank you yeah and I really think it's important at this point to just note I think there's two tracks generally here if the public ordinance public tree ordinance and the tree committee mostly assisting dpw with public trees and that's what the dpw then you have the private tree ordinance and that's going to be a zoning related related to the planning department our zoning project and likely enforced by the building department so I just think we should try to keep those<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2865.78s">[Bears]</a>: in track.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2866.921s">[Bears]</a>: So if you wanted to move on a motion here on the public to refer this public tree ordinance draft with these track changes and the tree committee ordinance with these track changes to the DPW, I think that would make sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2883.07s">[Bears]</a>: We can get that cost estimate, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2885.891s">[Bears]</a>: So I think that'll be the motion for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2891.855s">[Bears]</a>: Let me know what you have, Mr. Clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2895.385s">[Bears]</a>: And then, yeah, I guess it makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2896.805s">[Bears]</a>: We could come back for another meeting once we've heard some from Tim and then go to send this to KP and then have a final meeting, hopefully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2907.148s">[Bears]</a>: So there'll be two more meetings on this before report out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2911.929s">[Bears]</a>: And this, you know, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2918.911s">[Bears]</a>: They're going to Tim.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2921.508s">[Bears]</a>: And Aggie, DPW forestry, DPW commissioner and DPW forestry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2926.793s">[Bears]</a>: However you want to handle that is obviously it's your department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2931.318s">[Bears]</a>: Just you is fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2932.078s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2932.359s">[Bears]</a>: So just the DPW commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2943.209s">[Bears]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2943.489s">[Bears]</a>: For comment and a cost estimate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2945.872s">[Bears]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2947.754s">[Bears]</a>: and uh tim when do you think we could maybe do you think meeting in january might be possible i think that's fine okay yeah january maybe add to the council work to schedule a further committee of the whole in january i just don't want to let this drop for 11 months 12 months like we did last time<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2977.642s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I'll go to them in a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2988.43s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2989.931s">[Bears]</a>: Is there a second on that motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2991.873s">[Bears]</a>: Second by Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2996.176s">[Bears]</a>: Yep, I'm going to go to discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2997.617s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to go to Loretta on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3000.139s">[Bears]</a>: Loretta, I'm going to unmute you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3001.62s">[Bears]</a>: If you could just provide your name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3007.395s">[Bears]</a>: Oh, give me one second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3009.419s">[Bears]</a>: There you go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3019.454s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, we can hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3149.959s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Loretta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3152.761s">[Bears]</a>: Any further comment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3153.602s">[Bears]</a>: I will go to Lois.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3155.743s">[Bears]</a>: Lois, name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3200.473s">[Bears]</a>: It looked to me based on the draft, and anyone can feel free to quirk me here, that the tree committee would mainly be involved in supporting efforts around the public trees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3212.82s">[Bears]</a>: Um, and I think a lot of this has to do with the, um, enforcement authority and the ability, like the city's ability to regulate these questions coming from different parts of Massachusetts general law, um, with the public, basically general law, chapter 87, regulating public trees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3231.933s">[Bears]</a>: And then the zoning state zoning law, chapter 40, a being what's relevant to the private, uh, property trees on private property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3240.038s">[Bears]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3241.209s">[Bears]</a>: I'm trying to look here just in the duties of the tree committee advisory matters concerning Medford's trees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3250.975s">[Bears]</a>: So this edit would bring some, I guess, some element of the private in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3259.48s">[Bears]</a>: I think we just have to figure out what legal authority there is for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3264.043s">[Bears]</a>: But I would think that the tree committee would generally be working<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3267.563s">[Bears]</a>: mainly with the forestry department and the DPW.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3271.405s">[Bears]</a>: I'm not sure if any folks want to correct me, that's my reading of the intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3285.953s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, the mayor would make appointments and the city council would confirm those appointments and then the committee would be staffed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3295.373s">[Bears]</a>: the mayor would determine who would be staffing and supporting the committee's work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3341.718s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Lois.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3410.01s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Commissioner McIvern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3417.415s">[Bears]</a>: All right, is there any further discussion on the motion from Councilor Callahan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3427.844s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3446.379s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, for the affirmative three absent, the motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3450.28s">[Bears]</a>: Maybe we can move into the private tree item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3467.504s">[Bears]</a>: One second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3469.437s">[Bears]</a>: There you go, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3819.382s">[Bears]</a>: I will, I will appreciate the credit, but I was able to use technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3824.207s">[Bears]</a>: It took me like 15 minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3825.528s">[Bears]</a>: So yeah, 10.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3827.39s">[Bears]</a>: I did it right here before we started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3829.612s">[Bears]</a>: So, but I appreciate that you think I did more work than I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3835.178s">[Bears]</a>: I think just if I could comment really quickly, you know, I don't know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3842.369s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know exactly where all of these came from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3846.453s">[Bears]</a>: I'm guessing it's from the ordinances that you cited in the letter, some different pieces of different pieces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3851.578s">[Bears]</a>: I do want to go to Scott and then maybe to Tim.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3855.802s">[Bears]</a>: But my general understanding is the tree warden generally isn't involved in the private sector regulatory realm and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3863.396s">[Bears]</a>: zoning enforcement is subject of the building department and code enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3867.139s">[Bears]</a>: So my suggestion is it might be worth sitting down outside of a public meeting with the building department, maybe making a decision not to include tree warden and DPW, and maybe that's a step forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3879.368s">[Bears]</a>: You can come up with something there, but I do want to give Scott a chance to talk before we move forward on anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3887.034s">[Bears]</a>: If you have anything to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3963.077s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3963.997s">[Bears]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3965.378s">[Bears]</a>: I'm sorry for not recognizing you as commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3967.378s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to just open it up to discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3973.8s">[Bears]</a>: Members of the council about path forward here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3983.502s">[Bears]</a>: Any thoughts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3989.784s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4070.841s">[Bears]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4071.462s">[Bears]</a>: I'm gonna go to Councilor Sanz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4238.692s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4273.11s">[Bears]</a>: I think it would make sense to involve the planning office and the NS Associates team<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4281.637s">[Bears]</a>: who is working on the zoning update in a meeting between, I guess, you or you and Councilor Collins, Commissioner Vandewalle, and some folks from PDS and NS to kind of work through this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4294.121s">[Bears]</a>: I know Attorney Silverstein could provide some guidance around the law without necessarily having to come up with a draft, send it to KP, get KP comments back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4307.23s">[Bears]</a>: but I think, yeah, I would suggest that that happened as kind of just a city meeting, a mini meeting of city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4313.914s">[Bears]</a>: And then when you guys have been able to iron something out that can come back to us and maybe it's part of the zoning process, or maybe it's, you know, we keep, we probably want to keep considering these three papers together, but I'm not sure how it'll interface with the work that we're doing for the zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4332.425s">[Bears]</a>: There's a pretty ambitious timeline and calendar there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4335.647s">[Bears]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4338.049s">[Bears]</a>: That would be my suggestion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4346.595s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4347.435s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Kelly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4533.89s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1717.514s">[Bears]</a>: Do we need to vote on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1734.14s">[Bears]</a>: But the recommendation would be to not- To not vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1738.883s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1740.484s">[Bears]</a>: I'll go to-<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2083.416s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2085.357s">[Bears]</a>: Ted, just a couple of quick questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2088.819s">[Bears]</a>: On this new growth here on the chart, this is new construction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2116.38s">[Bears]</a>: That'd be accurate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2116.941s">[Bears]</a>: This year, how much of it was like a condo conversion or an exempt building coming on versus just new building or major renovations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2196.631s">[Bears]</a>: OK, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2199.194s">[Bears]</a>: And are we getting better at capturing that or what's changing to drive the new growth numbers higher?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2251.934s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks, just one more question on the residential exemption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2255.323s">[Bears]</a>: The break even seemed a lot higher this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2257.145s">[Bears]</a>: I think last time we talked it was in the high 700s, low 800s.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2261.268s">[Bears]</a>: Is that just a major change in valuations or what happened there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2329.352s">[Bears]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2329.712s">[Bears]</a>: And I know you gave us the average single family value was 804.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2333.074s">[Bears]</a>: Do you have the median?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2375.677s">[Bears]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2376.077s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2376.317s">[Bears]</a>: And I just say that because I think it would be valuable in the future if we could get<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2381.323s">[Bears]</a>: figures on the number of residential parcels that fall below the break-even point and then those that fall above.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2387.186s">[Bears]</a>: Because I think the council has expressed interest in the residential exemption and would want to have those discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2396.091s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2396.431s">[Bears]</a>: I'll go to Councilor Tseng then Councilor Callaghan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2633.324s">[Bears]</a>: Sorry, one second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2715.543s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2717.978s">[Bears]</a>: I think you'll go to Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3333.583s">[Bears]</a>: Ted, just I think to clarify the point,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3338.354s">[Bears]</a>: If we were planning for the residential exemption, the tax rate that you would have submitted tonight would have been different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3344.325s">[Bears]</a>: It would have been higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3345.607s">[Bears]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3346.809s">[Bears]</a>: And the issue being if we pass this tax rate,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3350.034s">[Bears]</a>: Essentially, let's say 10,000 people apply for 35% exemptions if that's what we pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3356.018s">[Bears]</a>: We would need to have tens of millions of dollars in the overlay account to pay back those exemptions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3362.002s">[Bears]</a>: But we wouldn't have raised that because the tax rate would be set based on not having that exemption, essentially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3434.875s">[Bears]</a>: They don't allow us to estimate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3439.332s">[Bears]</a>: So if you would open up applications in June, we receive 9,000, you could say we expect this, that would, and then, or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3489.948s">[Bears]</a>: And so just again, to clarify, there'd be a separate vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3493.988s">[Bears]</a>: This would not be the vote to establish the exemption?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3496.229s">[Bears]</a>: This would be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3540.746s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks, Councilor Calderon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3557.079s">[Bears]</a>: Go ahead, Jared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3606.291s">[Bears]</a>: The condo is 23.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3608.432s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just putting this in the calculator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3610.952s">[Bears]</a>: The two family 104s are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3618.201s">[Bears]</a>: 24%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3621.002s">[Bears]</a>: The three-family 105s are 3%, 2.9%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3623.343s">[Bears]</a>: In the denominator, you're using 16.025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3627.185s">[Bears]</a>: 16.025, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3627.385s">[Bears]</a>: That would be accurate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3638.169s">[Bears]</a>: number of parcels over that three families, so four and up is only 116, so it's only 0.01.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3644.79s">[Bears]</a>: It's 0.007, so what, 0.7?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3651.032s">[Bears]</a>: Right, it's parcels, not units, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3654.893s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I think units would be useful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3656.593s">[Bears]</a>: I think even also like valuation, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3659.674s">[Bears]</a>: It's 116 parcels, but it's probably 20, $30 million of valuation in that 116.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3672.243s">[Bears]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3672.604s">[Bears]</a>: So we have, let's do this as a B paper and we can combine this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3678.369s">[Bears]</a>: So we have a B paper from Councilor Callahan, 2.1 request legal procedure to adopt residential exemption from KP law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3697.236s">[Bears]</a>: And then your second part of it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3729.527s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3729.847s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I think that if we could add in the number of units above or number of parcels above and below the break even.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3743.971s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3744.351s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to go to Councilor Collins and then Councilor Scarpelli, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3904.467s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3904.727s">[Bears]</a>: I'm gonna go to Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4094.682s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4327.724s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4328.164s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion on either the B paper or the main paper?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4336.058s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, we'll go to public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4338.319s">[Bears]</a>: Is there anyone who would like to speak in person or on Zoom?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4341.559s">[Bears]</a>: Please come to the podium in person or raise your hand on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4352.862s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4356.303s">[Bears]</a>: So name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4358.984s">[Bears]</a>: And you can talk on any of the items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4429.296s">[Bears]</a>: So it's on the council portal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4497.614s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4500.615s">[Bears]</a>: So first, we'll take the B paper by Councilor Callahan to request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4506.338s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Andy when we take, we're going to have a bunch of motions here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4509.6s">[Bears]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4511.246s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, we're gonna have five votes so, and you can talk on like the third one, wherever we end up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4519.094s">[Bears]</a>: We have a B paper from Councilor Callahan to request the legal procedure to adopt residential exemption from KP law and also to request from the assessor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4529.063s">[Bears]</a>: The percentage of units and valuation across the residential classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4533.923s">[Bears]</a>: And also I think as amended, if you would just include the number of residential units or parcels above and below the breakeven point for the exemption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4544.25s">[Bears]</a>: So we have that motion from Councilor Callahan, seconded by seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4555.458s">[Bears]</a>: On the B paper, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4580.223s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4581.363s">[Bears]</a>: Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4582.904s">[Bears]</a>: The B paper is adopted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4585.185s">[Bears]</a>: We have four votes ahead of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4587.006s">[Bears]</a>: First, we had the motion from Councilor Collins to adopt the 175% shift, which I think would be a motion to adopt a minimum residential factor of 0.9072.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4595.931s">[Bears]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4607.196s">[Bears]</a>: Maximum or minimum?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4616.512s">[Bears]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5414.112s">[Bears]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5417.253s">[Bears]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5543.161s">[Bears]</a>: It looks like he's might be coming back right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5547.762s">[Bears]</a>: But if you want to go for it, Jared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5591.604s">[Bears]</a>: I think that would be helpful for future discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5595.752s">[Bears]</a>: And just to add on to the context of your point,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5598.76s">[Bears]</a>: The issue is also that you're making an assumption of like how many people are going to take it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5602.983s">[Bears]</a>: And the point is the break even point has to be set based on that assumption to keep the levy even.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5609.427s">[Bears]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5609.627s">[Bears]</a>: So you're setting a new tax rate to raise the same amount of money, but you're basing that on the assumption of how what percentage of residential classes will not change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5622.682s">[Bears]</a>: And under this system, you may, let's say you have a, and this is just, I wanna clarify this too, like say you're in a three-family unit, one of the units is owner-occupied, the other two are not, would that whole structure qualify for an owner occupancy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5638.531s">[Bears]</a>: So you basically would have people, even if they, let's say that three-family is worth 1.2 million, it's over the break-even point, they would have to apply for the owner-occupied exemption<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5651.069s">[Bears]</a>: their taxes are still gonna go up even though they'll qualify for the exemption essentially, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5654.871s">[Bears]</a>: But it'll just go up less than if they didn't get the exemption at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5659.453s">[Bears]</a>: And I'm not saying that to make, I mean, it's a specific case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5665.716s">[Bears]</a>: Adam has it, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5667.137s">[Bears]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5667.937s">[Bears]</a>: Does that answer your question, Gaston?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5679.025s">[Bears]</a>: And it's different across the different property classes too, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5682.268s">[Bears]</a>: Are you mostly just assuming single family and condo?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5711.421s">[Bears]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5713.522s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1493.116s">[Bears]</a>: which which one we can get people here for but I also just wanted to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1498.837s">[Bears]</a>: really appreciate what the program means year round for students and keeping them engaged in the community and involved, not just in football activities, but community activities, community service, and academic success.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1514.426s">[Bears]</a>: It really is something that not just the football program, the crew team, the band, every program that we have in our city,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1524.452s">[Bears]</a>: gives a young person an opportunity to be more involved in their community, or maybe helps make sure they stay involved in their community and stay on track and I think that that is really the great benefit of the vibrant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1537.532s">[Bears]</a>: activities that we have arts, sports, music, all of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1541.494s">[Bears]</a>: And also, I do want to ask Coach Curley, how he's going to replace the GBL MVP and I think now all time Mustang football scoring leader and Justin Marino, it's pretty impressive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1551.757s">[Bears]</a>: So, you know, we can have a little sports fun too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1556.459s">[Bears]</a>: It's got a brother in the fifth grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1558.82s">[Bears]</a>: It's a lot of pressure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1562.287s">[Bears]</a>: But yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1566.309s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1567.509s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion on this motion as amended by Councilor Scarpelli to invite representatives from the team or the full team if they can all make it to a future meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1578.854s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none on the motion of Councilor Collins to approve as amended seconded by Councilor Tseng, all those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1583.956s">[Bears]</a>: Opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1584.456s">[Bears]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1586.32s">[Bears]</a>: second resolution under suspension, be it resolved that we celebrate and congratulate our Medford Mustang marching band on their NESBA championship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1594.663s">[Bears]</a>: And we'll say that that's from Councilor Lazzaro Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1599.025s">[Bears]</a>: And just wanted to introduce that our marching band also has seen, I was in the marching band and I sat through I think four consecutive<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1608.052s">[Bears]</a>: four or five, I think it might've been there even longer than that, consecutive Thanksgiving losses, but it was still awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1615.178s">[Bears]</a>: The program was still doing community work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1618.62s">[Bears]</a>: Cheer Squad was doing great and we were doing well, but it was at a time, Councilor Scarpelli knows we've talked about it, of cuts where we lost our marching director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1628.528s">[Bears]</a>: We had one person doing the band.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1630.81s">[Bears]</a>: And we've seen this really vibrant resurgence over the last 10 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1636.267s">[Bears]</a>: For better, I mean, thankfully from, but from the parents and from private fundraising to support the band as someone who thinks that it would be great to have the public funds back in those programs that that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1648.331s">[Bears]</a>: All that extra work doesn't go unnoticed, even though I don't think that needs to happen and I think it can be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1655.216s">[Bears]</a>: I'd love to see more support but our band has really seen that resurgence to in recent years winning multiple NSBA championships.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1663.502s">[Bears]</a>: And, you know, my senior year we didn't have we didn't march.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1668.188s">[Bears]</a>: You know that that's how bad it had gotten we had a field show but we stood in place and we performed it or we performed it from the stands and now you have a color guard, and you have percussion and you have electronically amplified instruments and all these things and new uniforms, all of these things that we didn't have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1687.307s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, and they're doing the tree and wreath sale to support the Medford Mustang Marching Band as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1692.529s">[Bears]</a>: So thanks to everyone for letting me go on first on this one, but it is a real passion of mine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1698.71s">[Bears]</a>: I want to celebrate them too and hope that someone will amend to invite them as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1704.412s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to go to Councilor Tseng and then Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1854.884s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1857.584s">[Bears]</a>: I'm gonna go to Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1920.89s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1969.022s">[Bears]</a>: And I do just want to note part of question eight was about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1975.207s">[Bears]</a>: trying to expand access to these programs, especially for kids who are taking the vocational programs, supporting coaches and trying to get their salaries up as part of negotiations and investing in not just the core academics, but the access to programs like our football team and our marching band and our crew team and others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1995.239s">[Bears]</a>: And that is a priority, you know, I think we've all talked about just what Councilor Lazzaro said reminded me, it's important to invest in all of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2005.194s">[Bears]</a>: That's something that we're going to be, well, the school committee is going to be doing over the next several months as they work on their budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2012.796s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion on this item?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2016.757s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none on the motion to approve by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Callahan on the paper as amended by Councilor Tseng to invite our marching band to a future meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2029.021s">[Bears]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2124.517s">[Bears]</a>: There are three parts of that ordinance, a tree committee ordinance, a public tree ordinance, and a private tree ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2132.539s">[Bears]</a>: Tree committee and public tree ordinance are going to, there's going to be a meeting with city staff and advocates and some members of the council to discuss further that ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2144.823s">[Bears]</a>: Private tree ordinance is being reviewed by the zoning team since it's a zoning ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2149.684s">[Bears]</a>: So that's probably going to either<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2152.011s">[Bears]</a>: get incorporated into our zoning updates project or at least be aligned with that project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2332.239s">[Bears]</a>: We have not received the recommendations of the Community Development Board yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2337.08s">[Bears]</a>: So general practice is that we would continue this public hearing to a date certain our next regular meeting of December 17th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2689.792s">[Bears]</a>: Maybe a dead exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2738.969s">[Bears]</a>: I can ask you to unmute if there's anything you'd like to add, and then I'll go to Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2750.309s">[Bears]</a>: Hello, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2751.591s">[Bears]</a>: How are you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2793.021s">[Bears]</a>: I will go to Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2842.328s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2843.129s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion to approve by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2846.533s">[Bears]</a>: Seconded by Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2847.554s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion by members of the Council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2850.979s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, is there any discussion by members of the public?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2855.681s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, I just want to say good luck, congratulations, and we are excited to have you filling the, you know, Chili Garden's been a big community anchor, so we look forward to having you in there and doing your business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2869.049s">[Bears]</a>: So congratulations on the motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2874.412s">[Bears]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2875.973s">[Bears]</a>: Opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2876.994s">[Bears]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2877.794s">[Bears]</a>: Congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2886.112s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2887.373s">[Bears]</a>: Motions, orders, and resolutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2890.515s">[Bears]</a>: 24-503 offered by Councilor Lazzaro, President Bears, and Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2894.057s">[Bears]</a>: Let me get the full language here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2900.782s">[Bears]</a>: Whereas speed is one of the most important factors in traffic safety and crashes that occur at lower speeds cause less injury.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2907.606s">[Bears]</a>: And whereas a pedestrian hit by a car traveling 40 miles per hour has a one in 10 chance of surviving a crash, while a pedestrian hit by a car traveling at 20 miles per hour has a nine in 10 chance of surviving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2919.213s">[Bears]</a>: And whereas Medford has set a citywide speed limit of 25 miles per hour on city controlled streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2924.915s">[Bears]</a>: and whereas Medford has a high proportion of state-controlled roads, including Mystic Valley and Alewife Brook Parkways, Route 16, Route 28, Route 38, and High Street, Route 60, which are Medford's busiest thoroughfares, connecting Medford, the surrounding towns, and I-93, and passing through residential and commercial areas, impacting the safety of people walking, cycling, taking transit, and driving to school, work, parks, grocery stores, natural spaces, and city squares.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2950.776s">[Bears]</a>: excuse me, and whereas Massachusetts general law chapter 90 section 18 allows city councils to petition state agencies to modify the speed limit on a state highway within their geographic boundaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2961.44s">[Bears]</a>: Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Medford city council that we respect the request and recommend that the Massachusetts department of conservation and recreation, DCR and Massachusetts department of transportation, MassDOT set the speed limit on route 16, route 28, route 38 and route 60 in Medford at 25 miles per hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2976.325s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3191.425s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3192.946s">[Bears]</a>: I will go to Councilor Callahan and then Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3195.789s">[Bears]</a>: But just before I do that, it might be worth the amendment being, saying Route 16, Route 28, Route 38, Route 60, and any other streets or highways controlled by state agencies, something like that as an amendment, just to be a catch-all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3229.063s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, because I off the top of my head I'm thinking of South Border Road, Elm Street, Highland Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3234.264s">[Bears]</a>: And there's a couple of other state, there's a Valley Parkway that's not part of Route 16 by the lakes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3241.026s">[Bears]</a>: I mean,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3242.606s">[Bears]</a>: Someone said that I think Medford has the second highest proportion of state-controlled roads after Boston, which is pretty wild, but we do have a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3250.572s">[Bears]</a>: And 38 is partially city, partially state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3253.034s">[Bears]</a>: I think 60 is the only one that's all under city control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3255.797s">[Bears]</a>: So I think a catch-all amendment might be worth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3272.051s">[Bears]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3272.872s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3273.834s">[Bears]</a>: I'll go to Councilor Callahan and then Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3310.651s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Kelly, and I'll go to Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3400.236s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3401.357s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, as someone who grew up on a state road, Fells Bay West, but has spent many years<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3410.751s">[Bears]</a>: looking out my driver's side mirror or looking left and right across the street, worried that someone's going to come whipping down Fells Bay West in the one-way section at 45 miles an hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3420.001s">[Bears]</a>: And they have taken out two of our cars and a tree in that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3425.087s">[Bears]</a>: And luckily, no people, but that's probably only because there's no crosswalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3429.291s">[Bears]</a>: And the only thing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3431.173s">[Bears]</a>: To our West is 93.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3432.935s">[Bears]</a>: There's other parts that are even much more dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3437.018s">[Bears]</a>: I'm a huge supporter of this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3438.579s">[Bears]</a>: I'm also directly experienced what it's like to lose someone in another community, not in Medford to traffic violence so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3448.807s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, it's just important to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3450.689s">[Bears]</a>: And I have here a suggested amendment in the last sentence, set the speed limit on any street, highway, or portion of a street or highway controlled by a state agency, including but not limited to Route 16, Route 28, Route 38, Route 60, South Border Road, Elm Street, and Highland Ave in Medford at 25 miles per hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3474.508s">[Bears]</a>: Sound good?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3476.75s">[Bears]</a>: You'll make that amendment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3480.402s">[Bears]</a>: I wrote it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3483.844s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion of Councilor Lazzaro to approve the resolution as amended, seconded by Councilor Callahan, is there any further discussion by members of the Council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3494.77s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, any discussion by members of the public?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3497.512s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3498.432s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please, and you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3676.473s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Ellery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3677.093s">[Bears]</a>: And I'd start with less drag racing myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3681.615s">[Bears]</a>: If we have anyone else who'd like to speak in person, you can come to the podium or on Zoom, raise your hand on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3688.697s">[Bears]</a>: I do see Mr. Castagnetti on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3691.218s">[Bears]</a>: I will unmute you, Mr. Castagnetti, name and address for the record, and then we'll go back to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3702.099s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Castagnetti, do you want to speak on this item?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3709.647s">[Bears]</a>: It may have been an error in hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3711.109s">[Bears]</a>: Oh, we got him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3712.21s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3713.111s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Castagnetti, name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3714.492s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3806.792s">[Bears]</a>: I believe state police enforces speed on the state-controlled roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3843.39s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3847.633s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Martha at the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3849.114s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3850.895s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3936.965s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3937.546s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3938.966s">[Bears]</a>: Emily Stein from the Safe Roads Alliance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3942.507s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4041.55s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Emily, and please reach out and let us know, Ellery, to anyone in the city, how we can support further efforts for regional and state coordination on road safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4053.133s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion by members of the Council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4055.973s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, I will go to the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4060.495s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4061.675s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4151.866s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4152.387s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, and I did want to just note enforcement is something<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4157.714s">[Bears]</a>: that we need more of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4158.875s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, it's not a state-controlled road, but I was on Winthrop Street coming down the hill from Tufts six weeks ago, and I'm doing 20, maybe 25, but 20 going down to 15 to go over the raised crosswalk in front of the church.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4170.42s">[Bears]</a>: Guy whips around me 45 miles an hour, left lane, opposite lane, oncoming traffic, and he's not all the way back into the right lane until Goldilocks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4179.685s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, and you had people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4182.082s">[Bears]</a>: trying to cross at West Street, trying to cross up a little further at Summer Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4185.425s">[Bears]</a>: It was just awful to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4187.527s">[Bears]</a>: And I, of course, immediately pulled over on South Street and called the chief because I had the license plate number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4193.432s">[Bears]</a>: And he says, we can't do anything but pull the plate, call them, and say, hey, you can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4198.055s">[Bears]</a>: But I can't enforce the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4201.178s">[Bears]</a>: So we need more enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4205.161s">[Bears]</a>: that, you know, I used to have some more concerns about the safe traffic cameras that I do now, given how people have been driving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4212.267s">[Bears]</a>: So with that, any further discussion on this item or public participation will go to Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4296.957s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4297.297s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4297.397s">[Bears]</a>: And I think, you know, there's several processes to be on the lookout for as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4301.361s">[Bears]</a>: Wellington Circle redesign, the Mystic Avenue, Main Street, Medford Square corridor design process, which is ongoing, and High Street and Mystic Valley Parkway at the Arlington border as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4312.572s">[Bears]</a>: I know there's designs for shrinking those rotaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4316.828s">[Bears]</a>: the lane width at those rotaries as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4318.509s">[Bears]</a>: And those are some really major projects that we should all be paying attention to, um, in terms of design and making sure that they're gonna keep us safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4326.452s">[Bears]</a>: So seeing no further discussion on the motion of Councilors are seconded by Council Vice President Collins as amended by Councilors are all those in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4338.236s">[Bears]</a>: Opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4338.736s">[Bears]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4340.697s">[Bears]</a>: Last thing we have on the agenda, public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4343.138s">[Bears]</a>: If you have public participation on any item that was not otherwise on the agenda, you can come to the podium or raise your hand on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4350.139s">[Bears]</a>: And I will go to Mr. Fiore, name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4353.26s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4440.239s">[Bears]</a>: That's a complicated question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4441.4s">[Bears]</a>: Actually, there are state routes like Route 60 that are city controlled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4446.847s">[Bears]</a>: Most of High Street and Salem Street is city controlled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4449.971s">[Bears]</a>: So I believe Medford does repairs on those the state controlled portions of state road state routes or non state routes, the agency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4460.083s">[Bears]</a>: that controls them is responsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4461.584s">[Bears]</a>: So, for example, I lived on Fells Way West.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4465.125s">[Bears]</a>: Our snow shoveling and snow removal, that's DCR region, I can't remember the region number, but it's the region that's up at Spot Pond, the headquarters there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4474.249s">[Bears]</a>: So Medford snow shoveling and street sweeping rules don't apply to that section of Fells Way West, nor does maintenance or redesign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4481.892s">[Bears]</a>: It's actually also one of the reasons that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4484.053s">[Bears]</a>: Main Street and Mystic Ave and Medford Square, that intersection design is so complicated, a portion of the streets are city controlled, a portion of the streets are DCR, and a portion of the streets are MassDOT.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4495.345s">[Bears]</a>: So you had to get all three of those groups together to approve design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4500.77s">[Bears]</a>: And probably when it's done, you'll have different agencies maintaining different parts of that intersection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4507.116s">[Bears]</a>: That's my general understanding of how it works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4509.537s">[Bears]</a>: It's probably even more specific stuff but for example, if you're going up fells way west towards stone them, or you can turn right onto Elm Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4519.682s">[Bears]</a>: They put a paint bump out to change the angle of the curve because it was really steep and people were just whipping right up Elm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4527.244s">[Bears]</a>: but it was just paint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4528.585s">[Bears]</a>: I remember talking with director Blake about putting bollards out to further try to make people actually follow the new curve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4537.553s">[Bears]</a>: And DCR said that they wouldn't do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4540.976s">[Bears]</a>: They didn't have the staff to maintain the bollards and Todd and DPW offered to do it ourselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4546.481s">[Bears]</a>: And they said, we won't let you do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4548.202s">[Bears]</a>: So there's jurisdictional questions that create some<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4552.614s">[Bears]</a>: really frustrating issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4622.024s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, cyclists on that street too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4623.985s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, I would have a really, I mean, it seems like a great place to go on a bike ride and then you're there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4651.647s">[Bears]</a>: There's a couple larger conversations DCR at the state level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4657.423s">[Bears]</a>: It used to be even more ridiculous how many agencies controlled different parkways and roadways, and they were regionalized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4663.725s">[Bears]</a>: And you had the old MDC and different regional district commissions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4667.126s">[Bears]</a>: And I won't go into it, but that all got merged into DCR.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4670.427s">[Bears]</a>: But it still doesn't make a ton of sense to have DCR maintaining all of these roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4674.188s">[Bears]</a>: MassDOT should probably be doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4675.349s">[Bears]</a>: It should be centralized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4676.569s">[Bears]</a>: DCR is deeply underfunded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4679.41s">[Bears]</a>: I think, yeah, I could go into that forever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4681.831s">[Bears]</a>: But that's another piece of the problem with the enforcement on,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4686.112s">[Bears]</a>: You know, fells by going up towards stone or south border road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4690.374s">[Bears]</a>: Snow shoveling, I mean it was ridiculous you know they won't even put up bollards to because they're like what if someone we don't have the staff capacity to put them back up if they get knocked down, so that was their justification so that that funding issue with DC ours and there's a problem to that needs to get solved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4704.941s">[Bears]</a>: But I appreciate the comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4706.042s">[Bears]</a>: And the one other thing is that the Chapter 90 money that we get, which is basically the only money most cities use for street maintenance, is based on just the proportion of the public ways that are in the city control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4717.469s">[Bears]</a>: So the state-controlled roads are out of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4719.49s">[Bears]</a>: The private ways are out of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4723.616s">[Bears]</a>: And that formula is also deeply underfunded, but we get an even shorter end of the stick because we have such a smaller proportion of the mileage in the city is actually controlled by the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4733.7s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4734.381s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4735.001s">[Bears]</a>: You got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4735.541s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4736.742s">[Bears]</a>: Any further public participation, either in person or on Zoom?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4742.244s">[Bears]</a>: We have Steve Schnapp.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4743.465s">[Bears]</a>: Steve, name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4745.786s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4816.388s">[Bears]</a>: I'll have to check my email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4817.849s">[Bears]</a>: We did receive a report for quarter one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4822.483s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I think it was within the last two weeks or maybe early November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4827.306s">[Bears]</a>: It would be incumbent on a councillor to move that item from unfinished business to take it up from the table for us to discuss it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4835.651s">[Bears]</a>: So if councillors want to do that, they're free to do so at any time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4840.554s">[Bears]</a>: And we do have a report that we got from the administration on fiscal 25 quarter one finances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4848.739s">[Bears]</a>: And I will work on the acronym thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4850.08s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks, Steve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4853.871s">[Bears]</a>: All right, any further discussion by members of the council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4858.4s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion to adjourn by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Tseng, all those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4863.391s">[Bears]</a>: Opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4863.852s">[Bears]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2128.944s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2133.806s">[Bears]</a>: Just wanted to say that I think this is a really great start to this proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2138.668s">[Bears]</a>: I appreciate its responsiveness to the city's comprehensive plan and the thousands of residents who participated in that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2148.689s">[Bears]</a>: And I also just appreciate the thoughtful presentation from Innis Associates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2151.811s">[Bears]</a>: I think what we're looking at is an enhancement to the area to make it what we want it to be, which is more walkable, bring commercial in, and just make it a place for the neighborhood instead of just the cut through that many people experience it as now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2171.023s">[Bears]</a>: I just really want to note<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2173.655s">[Bears]</a>: the comment about the sprinkling of gas stations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2176.757s">[Bears]</a>: You know, not only is that from like a design perspective and an experience perspective, not great, but we've had a lot of problems with those stations over the years as a community being not great neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2190.505s">[Bears]</a>: So that's something to note.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2193.107s">[Bears]</a>: And we're also going to see this become high frequency transit corridor with the T96 coming soon every 15 minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2200.791s">[Bears]</a>: And this is going to, I think,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2202.632s">[Bears]</a>: really respond to that and make this a really improve some of the outstanding issues with the existing zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2210.959s">[Bears]</a>: I want to thank Innis Associates for noting the residential blocks remaining residential, keeping historic buildings, as well as noting like the serious loopholes in the existing zoning that would allow like a 12-story hotel right now, which I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2228.729s">[Bears]</a>: None of us, nobody wants that here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2230.51s">[Bears]</a>: So correcting this to match more of the community character and identity while also enhancing it in exactly the ways that we want it to was the goal of the comprehensive plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2240.553s">[Bears]</a>: And that seems to be the content of this draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2242.854s">[Bears]</a>: So I look forward to discussing this next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2246.315s">[Bears]</a>: Also just want to thank the chair for working with the administration on the outreach plan, both for this meeting and for the meetings in the upcoming six month period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2255.118s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2969.841s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2973.329s">[Bears]</a>: Just wanted to note also that when we redid the zoning with Mark Hrabowski, probably most of these discussions were two terms ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2982.29s">[Bears]</a>: Supreme Court decisions don't allow like there were like family restrictions on renting units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2988.877s">[Bears]</a>: Those are illegal and were removed like for three years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2993.182s">[Bears]</a>: So those aren't in the zoning anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2994.904s">[Bears]</a>: And I just also wanted to know, in terms of next steps on this proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3001.041s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, we'll be coming back next week and having the meeting here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3004.642s">[Bears]</a>: Then this will be referred to a council meeting to then be referred to a community development board meeting to then be referred back to a final council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3011.903s">[Bears]</a>: So there will be three public hearings after the public meeting next week, in addition to the meeting next week, although next week is a great opportunity for discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3022.245s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=965.6s">[Bears]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1000.728s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Chair Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1003.049s">[Bears]</a>: Just wanted to thank the Collins Center representatives for being there in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1006.191s">[Bears]</a>: Apologies that I can't join you there tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1009.033s">[Bears]</a>: I'm really excited to hear from the Collins Center what the next steps are for the council to take action on the proposals and the framework of the Charter Study Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1019.179s">[Bears]</a>: I know that we haven't received that yet, so we won't be discussing their proposals and specifics, but more of what the timeline will look like in the new year for us to consider that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1030.41s">[Bears]</a>: And, you know, I have a few questions after we hear from them, but in general, I'm excited to work with my colleagues on this committee to consider, you know, any amendments to the proposals from the study committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1044.975s">[Bears]</a>: And then my personal preference, I think, would be to hopefully report something out by the end of the spring to put on the ballot in November that would go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1054.679s">[Bears]</a>: And then if the voters were to approve it, it would go into effect<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1058.752s">[Bears]</a>: after the 2027 or for the 2027 election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1063.355s">[Bears]</a>: So still a ways away from this going into effect, but really excited and hopeful and looking forward to working with my colleagues over the next few months on finalizing a proposal and getting that before the voters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1078.603s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1467.12s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1467.62s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, you answered one of my questions around the referendum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1472.721s">[Bears]</a>: My second question is, what is the mechanism that we use for the referendum?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1475.901s">[Bears]</a>: Is it technically that the council is placing a non-binding ballot question on the ballot, or is there another mechanism of mass general law that we're using in this case to place a referendum on the ballot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1508.86s">[Bears]</a>: And is that a bind?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1509.962s">[Bears]</a>: And so then essentially the language of that bind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1514.827s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1812.674s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I just want to take advantage of your experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1816.437s">[Bears]</a>: on any tips and tricks around the legislative process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1818.859s">[Bears]</a>: I know sometimes things can get hung up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1821.462s">[Bears]</a>: Are there any other strategies and approaches that you can suggest?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1825.245s">[Bears]</a>: I was thinking, would it be helpful to invite our delegation to a council meeting where they can see us report it out or come to a committee meeting and ask questions in advance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1835.614s">[Bears]</a>: Just any tips and tricks to move this through the legislature would be much appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1921.422s">[Bears]</a>: If I could follow up, Chair Singh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1925.225s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1927.407s">[Bears]</a>: Along those lines, would it be possible for us as a committee, as we move through different pieces of the proposed charter and different portions of that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1939.449s">[Bears]</a>: to consult with you on how far those proposals may be straying from a standard or something the legislature is more familiar with?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1957.225s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1957.565s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=2426.957s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=2427.397s">[Bears]</a>: I just wanted to say that's the second compliment this council has received from the Collins Center in as many years on our diligence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=2435.322s">[Bears]</a>: So we appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=2437.904s">[Bears]</a>: But I just wanted to also ask, is there any<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=2450.154s">[Bears]</a>: know, maybe I'll leave this for a more specific session, but I just wanted to thank you guys again for being here, for answering our questions, moving through the process, and I really look forward to working with you as we review the proposal of the Charter Study Committee and get to an agreement with the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=2467.838s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=2558.731s">[Bears]</a>: Just wanted to move to keep the paper in committee and adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=2593.992s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3148.011s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3149.271s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I think just to the goal of the outline as presented today was to identify when certain areas of the city<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3160.345s">[Bears]</a>: we'll see map changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3162.326s">[Bears]</a>: And then additionally, within those months, we'll also be looking at some of those other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3166.449s">[Bears]</a>: So I think TDM, basically I'm repeating what everyone else said, but there are topics that are going to be brought up over those five months that aren't included in that outline right now, because we felt like the priority was to try to let people know when the committee would be looking at map changes in different parts of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3812.765s">[Bears]</a>: Just wanted to go through, discuss the process from here on out, just to confirm with everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3821.594s">[Bears]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3823.556s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, well, right now, it's allowed in C2 and industrial, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3835.157s">[Bears]</a>: I think it's special permanency to industrial, I think is the current, plus there's basically, you can't be within a certain number of feet from certain institutions, educational, religious, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3850.746s">[Bears]</a>: Right, that shouldn't be carried through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3852.147s">[Bears]</a>: So yeah, I would say no, it's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3854.909s">[Bears]</a>: It won't be in the Salem Street District.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3860.307s">[Bears]</a>: But yeah, it shouldn't be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3872.772s">[Bears]</a>: That was C1, so it was just probably carried over because... Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3882.185s">[Bears]</a>: I think to the larger point, I just wanted to go through the process from this point forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3886.908s">[Bears]</a>: So assuming that the committee votes to refer out a proposal tonight, that would appear on the regular agenda for our next regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3894.893s">[Bears]</a>: And I just want you guys to correct me if I'm wrong at any point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3898.835s">[Bears]</a>: That would be referred to the Community Development Board, and the Community Development Board would hold a public hearing where further public comment could be taken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3907.836s">[Bears]</a>: And then that would come back to the city council for a public hearing after a recommendations are made by the community development board, at which point it would require a further vote of the council to amend the zoning ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3919.822s">[Bears]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3923.464s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3924.925s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3929.349s">[Bears]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3929.729s">[Bears]</a>: So there's two more public hearings after tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3932.611s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6783.595s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks, Madam Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6785.356s">[Bears]</a>: And I just wanted to build off a couple of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6786.837s">[Bears]</a>: I think too, there was the granular analysis that was done, but also, you know, we're not going, when you look at the apartment one in the commercial districts, the parcel boundaries actually aren't that out of bounds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6799.384s">[Bears]</a>: It's just like the dimensional and the use requirements are kind of nuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6802.165s">[Bears]</a>: So it seems to me that by and large, that existing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6808.317s">[Bears]</a>: delineation was also used partly to outline some of the how far back things go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6813.9s">[Bears]</a>: Of course, with some differences when you have that large apartment building on Paris Street, I think that, you know, was not in that zone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6820.724s">[Bears]</a>: But in any case, I think the bigger question and the thought actually brings us all the way back to the beginning of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6829.809s">[Bears]</a>: When we talk about walkability and accessibility and placemaking and streetscape.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6836.874s">[Bears]</a>: this is one piece of the implementation of the comprehensive plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6840.677s">[Bears]</a>: We're implementing land use and zoning policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6844.22s">[Bears]</a>: Emily and others have spoken to how incentive zoning and other elements here, and I'm also going to hopefully say in the future that site plan review processes and other things when things actually, you know, when this zoning actually turns into proposals and turns into construction of new buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6866.03s">[Bears]</a>: That is where the rubber will meet the road to a large extent of actually improving the streetscape, getting a large new, say someone does want to put a few parcels together and build something big, not saying that that's what we want all over the place here, but they may need to give more back to the community to improve a stretch of the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6885.971s">[Bears]</a>: And so in addition to the traffic commission and all the other things that we want to do, a piece of this through the incentive zoning and through site plan review and through just the general transformation and goal that we want to see here over a long period of time, that is what will help us to make this a safer, more accessible, more walkable street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6906.076s">[Bears]</a>: So when we see the implementation of the comprehensive plan recommendations,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6914.574s">[Bears]</a>: happening piecemeal because it has to happen piecemeal because we're just focused on the zoning piece right now it doesn't mean it's not that it's not factoring in these other questions around what it means to improve the street and actually<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6928.504s">[Bears]</a>: this being an emanation or an iteration or an implementation of the comprehensive plan is an important thing to remind ourselves of because we can go back to the comprehensive plan and say, okay, one piece of creating these walkable vibrant neighborhoods is zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6943.791s">[Bears]</a>: Another piece is something we may need to be talking about in our traffic commission or be talking about in another sense here in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6951.154s">[Bears]</a>: So I just think that's important to note too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6954.485s">[Bears]</a>: There's a great implementation table at the back of that comprehensive plan that is kind of its own.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6960.447s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, I can't even think of the word to describe it, but it's intense and this is a piece of that implementation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6967.27s">[Bears]</a>: So I hope we can keep having the discussions and especially have the discussions when we have specific projects that want to be built coming after the establishing of the new zoning ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6981.579s">[Bears]</a>: I think there is that comprehensive holistic approach, and it just doesn't always get implemented all at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6988.206s">[Bears]</a>: And we're implementing different pieces of the comprehensive plan through different processes, and this is just one of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6994.211s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cCFTFy23gjY&t=34.468s">[Bears]</a>: Test one, two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=336.517s">[Bears]</a>: All right, well, last meeting of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=372.284s">[Bears]</a>: present, five present, two absent, the meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=375.727s">[Bears]</a>: There'll be a meeting of the Medford City Council Committee of the Whole at 6 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=379.07s">[Bears]</a>: on December 18th, 2024 via Zoom only.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=382.372s">[Bears]</a>: The action and discussion item for this meeting is paper 24-006, which is a review of the 2024-2025 Council Governing Agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=393.702s">[Bears]</a>: So we'll take that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=396.444s">[Bears]</a>: At our first regular meeting, January 9th, 2024,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=400.616s">[Bears]</a>: We resolved that Councilors would submit items to create a governing agenda document based on a draft template.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=407.363s">[Bears]</a>: We then met on January 24th, 2024 to review the governing agenda and refer it out to each of the committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=417.732s">[Bears]</a>: And we also made a motion to have reviews in June and December and to review the governing agenda regularly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=425.988s">[Bears]</a>: And pursuant to those motions, we held the committee of the whole, I believe in June, and now we're having one in December to review progress to date, to suggest updates to the document, and to send a link to resident services and public engagement committee to be included in the January newsletter, the updated document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=446.906s">[Bears]</a>: I wanna thank Vice President Collins for working on the updated document with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=452.15s">[Bears]</a>: Folks can find it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=454.045s">[Bears]</a>: at a link that I'll post in the chat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=455.886s">[Bears]</a>: It's also available on the city website, but it is also on the council portal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=464.092s">[Bears]</a>: And this is as of Monday when the agenda went out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=468.254s">[Bears]</a>: So again, thank you, Vice President Collins for your work on this with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=473.418s">[Bears]</a>: And I think we can either start with any comments or questions from councillors, and then we can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=480.796s">[Bears]</a>: quickly go through and review highlights from each committee so far this year and what's coming up for the next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=488.524s">[Bears]</a>: With that, I'm happy to go to Vice President Collins if there's anything you'd like to add.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=678.186s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=679.788s">[Bears]</a>: I'll recognize Councilor Callahan in just a moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=682.751s">[Bears]</a>: And just wanted to note, you know, throughout this project, this meeting, if folks have amendments that they'd like to make or edits, or if they want to submit edits subsequent to the meeting, we can update the document a little further before it goes out with the newsletter in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=697.629s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=733.371s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=739.855s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=740.336s">[Bears]</a>: I wasn't going to take credit, and I really do feel like it's a team effort, but, you know, working with my colleagues over the past few years and seeing what I thought and then working with everyone in this council to implement some changes around<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=755.905s">[Bears]</a>: this document, creating a committee structure that really focused on being functional and effective and aligning with how the city works was a major priority at the beginning of the term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=767.889s">[Bears]</a>: And I think it's gone well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=769.009s">[Bears]</a>: I am going to note some unexpected things that we've learned so far and just ways to think about this going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=778.833s">[Bears]</a>: But overall, I'm really just proud of this council and the work that we've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=784.176s">[Bears]</a>: putting it out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=784.876s">[Bears]</a>: I totally agree with you, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=787.597s">[Bears]</a>: Having this document and being able to point to a single document, yeah, it's a little long and sometimes a little wordy and maybe a little wonky, but to say here's what we're doing and it's actually comprehensive is groundbreaking in my opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=807.389s">[Bears]</a>: All right, well, we can start I just want to, I'll do a quick screen share and if folks, you know, want me to do that when they're talking about their committees or any other point I'm happy to do it but just wanted to let people see kind of the form of this document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=821.299s">[Bears]</a>: So, this is the front cover page with all our lovely names on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=827.56s">[Bears]</a>: City Seal, but there's this great table of contents and luckily our new portal even makes it linkable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=832.945s">[Bears]</a>: You can click into each different section, starting with a helpful document section, and then it's broken down by each of our committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=840.933s">[Bears]</a>: Our Committee of the Whole, Administration and Finance Committee, our Education and Culture Committee,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=847.506s">[Bears]</a>: the Governance Committee, Planning and Permitting Committee, which has been particularly prolific, and as well as our Public Health and Community Safety Committee, Public Works and Facilities Committee, and the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=861.578s">[Bears]</a>: And within each of those sections, there is a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=865.438s">[Bears]</a>: kind of broken down in three ways, some major projects that the committee is working on, some ordinances that the committee is working on, and then some of the oversight and engagement work that committees do as part of their task.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=880.491s">[Bears]</a>: So I'll start with our helpful documents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=883.554s">[Bears]</a>: This is just a great place to find just a few quick links to some of the major plans and things that we reference regularly in our meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=893.837s">[Bears]</a>: are not just our committees and their members, but the city's ordinance, the code, as well as the major plan governing a lot of what we're doing around the city comprehensive plan, talking about zoning and built environment and what the vision for the community is over the next 30 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=911.04s">[Bears]</a>: Housing production plan, how we're trying to produce more housing so that people who live here can stay here and people who want to live here can move here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=919.082s">[Bears]</a>: A climate action and adaptation plan to address the climate crisis,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=924.574s">[Bears]</a>: and our open space and recreation plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=927.416s">[Bears]</a>: And I'm hoping we can get some more documents linked in here in the future as well as they are developed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=937.381s">[Bears]</a>: Our committee of the whole, which I chair, but as a committee of all seven councilors has had a lot of meetings, but mostly those are meetings to review papers from the mayor or to review things that have been reported out of another committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=952.835s">[Bears]</a>: order review kind of ad hoc resolutions that are coming up during the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=957.338s">[Bears]</a>: But we did have two projects in committee of the whole term started the tree preservation protection and replacement ordinances and our food truck ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=967.963s">[Bears]</a>: We have held meetings on those this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=969.704s">[Bears]</a>: Food truck ordinance we are hoping to incorporate some significant legal feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=975.707s">[Bears]</a>: We definitely learned a lot about the laws around food trucks and our meeting on that this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=980.707s">[Bears]</a>: And the tree ordinance we met on in November and the tree ordinances, the public tree ordinance and the tree committee ordinance are awaiting some review by city staff as well as some Councilors before coming back to the council committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=997.258s">[Bears]</a>: And then the private tree ordinance is going to be reviewed by city staff and incorporated also into our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1006.516s">[Bears]</a>: or at least reviewed by our zoning consultant because that is mainly a zoning ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1010.317s">[Bears]</a>: So that is being, we're taking advantage of the resources that we have around zoning to review the private tree ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1016.338s">[Bears]</a>: And the goal is really to get this done early in 2025 so that we can get these ordinances on the books and update our public tree ordinance and get a workable private tree ordinance in place so that we can stop losing trees and hopefully start growing our tree canopy again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1037.503s">[Bears]</a>: So that's Committee of the Whole, happy to, it's an easy one, happy to pause there and if anyone has any comments or anything they want to add on the Committee of the Whole before moving to the next committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1056.815s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, I will also take on the next committee, which is our Administration and Finance Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1061.938s">[Bears]</a>: This hasn't met as much as<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1064.99s">[Bears]</a>: I had initially thought and it's kind of one of those lessons learned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1068.252s">[Bears]</a>: I think a lot of what this committee nominally is responsible for is our things that we've been doing in committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1076.255s">[Bears]</a>: There have certainly been a few meetings on more on the ordinance level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1080.017s">[Bears]</a>: But, you know, we have our annual budget process every year that happens mostly in committee of the whole meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1088.982s">[Bears]</a>: And we are now going to be in our second year of an annual budget process guided by our first ever budget ordinance, which is really exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1097.15s">[Bears]</a>: As folks noted, there were some dates in the meeting schedules for the upcoming six months around the budget, including getting some of our budget recommendations in early March per the budget ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1113.0s">[Bears]</a>: And we did work on a major project around the Proposition 2.5 overrides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1119.146s">[Bears]</a>: We had our first ever override process this year, and since Proposition 2.5 went into effect nearly 50 years ago, and the passage of Questions 7 and 8 is really significant for our public schools and our DPW.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1132.938s">[Bears]</a>: So that's going to be a part of our budget process for the first time this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1137.939s">[Bears]</a>: working, you know, we have we did appropriate the funds for the DPW sidewalk and street repair crew to bring that back in house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1145.521s">[Bears]</a>: Certainly won't fix every street and sidewalk, but it's good to have a team in the DPW dedicated to this and the staffing restored for this function, which is really a basic essential function.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1159.064s">[Bears]</a>: And we have the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1161.619s">[Bears]</a>: certainly that we will hear from our Medford public schools, the school committee will be working on implementing their supplemental budget this year and then working on their budget process for fiscal 26.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1172.962s">[Bears]</a>: And, you know, our role in that is just to approve the allocation and they approve the expenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1179.443s">[Bears]</a>: But I know that it's going to be a really impactful year in our public schools because of the funds that are going to be available for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1188.223s">[Bears]</a>: So that's exciting around the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1190.144s">[Bears]</a>: I talked again a lot about the revenue generation project and proposition two and a half.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1196.007s">[Bears]</a>: We were able to complete, you know, at least a piece of that project this year around the overrides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1203.951s">[Bears]</a>: And, you know, I think revenue generation outside of proposition two and a half is always a focus of the council, especially when it comes to economic development, as well as just updating our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1216.721s">[Bears]</a>: city's ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1218.181s">[Bears]</a>: I really want to thank Councilor Leming for leading on linkage fees, hopeful that we'll be able to meet on updating the fee schedule for the city early this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1228.364s">[Bears]</a>: That was a big call as well from the council earlier this year, just so that we're not 30 years out of date on inflation, which we have been on way too many things in the city for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1244.448s">[Bears]</a>: I'll just move quickly through the rest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1245.749s">[Bears]</a>: Another project that we talked about was the classification and compensation study implementation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1252.171s">[Bears]</a>: We were hoping to get started on this many months ago, but we have not received any sort of document or really even any sort of update from the city administration on when we can expect to be updating the city's personnel ordinance and looking at this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1267.418s">[Bears]</a>: So I'm going to be checking back in with the administration in the new year on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1272.66s">[Bears]</a>: And I will go to Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1288.545s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, our role is really to we have to update the personal ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1294.126s">[Bears]</a>: That's how the so that element of it around compensation and changes to the different classifications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1303.214s">[Bears]</a>: in that ordinance, that would all have to come to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1306.655s">[Bears]</a>: So I think the next step is we need to see what those recommendations were and then discuss those changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1314.378s">[Bears]</a>: And I think it's a big project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1317.559s">[Bears]</a>: I think we should take due diligence and time with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1319.899s">[Bears]</a>: But really, the next step is that we need to have the administration<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1325.976s">[Bears]</a>: let us know if that study is completed, if there's a document, some sort of implementation recommendation from the Collins Center, and then look at that from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1336.322s">[Bears]</a>: So, we'll see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1344.888s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, absolutely, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1346.989s">[Bears]</a>: I'll get in touch with them and let them know it's something we want to work on this year, this upcoming year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1353.897s">[Bears]</a>: mentioned the linkage fee project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1355.578s">[Bears]</a>: We have a home rule petition in at the State House to update the linkage fee ordinance and allow for regular updates to our linkage fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1368.903s">[Bears]</a>: And I believe also then we would look at an updated linkage fee ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1372.564s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know if Councilor Leming, you want to talk any more about that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1375.265s">[Bears]</a>: You were really leading that project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1473.707s">[Bears]</a>: Great, thank you, Councilor Leming for that update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1477.008s">[Bears]</a>: And the Home Rule petition did end up getting submitted<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1481.318s">[Bears]</a>: Uh, this session so and I actually did have a little correspondence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1484.761s">[Bears]</a>: I'm slightly hopeful it might end up in an end of year omnibus bill or a local, uh, home rule petitions package.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1490.967s">[Bears]</a>: Um, so Maybe we'll we'll have some good news on that before January 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1497.912s">[Bears]</a>: We'll see Great Um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1503.595s">[Bears]</a>: We also worked on maximizing tax exemptions that are allowed by the state to maximize those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1510.278s">[Bears]</a>: I really want to thank Councilor Leming on both the MGL Chapter 59, Section 5, Clause 22G, as well as adopting provisions of the HERO Act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1522.343s">[Bears]</a>: That is something we are always looking for to make sure that our residents have the most opportunities under state law for exemptions from the property tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1535.694s">[Bears]</a>: We have also completed an establishment of a General Stabilization Fund and a Capital Stabilization Fund and Water Sewer Stabilization Fund, which has already been making a difference this year, having access to reserve funds for emergencies and capital needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1555.738s">[Bears]</a>: Ordinances-wise, we passed our budget ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1558.299s">[Bears]</a>: So excited about that and excited to see it used again this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1564.178s">[Bears]</a>: We did discuss the commercial vacancy tax, and that is still in committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1569.119s">[Bears]</a>: Maybe it can come up again in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1570.839s">[Bears]</a>: I will go over to Councilor Levingston, since that was his proposal, if he wants to talk about it more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1644.067s">[Bears]</a>: So this has really evolved and maybe we should update this, uh, going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1650.929s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1651.977s">[Bears]</a>: I'll keep that as a note.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1654.181s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Clerk, if you could keep as a note, we want to update this section around the commercial vacancy tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1695.816s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing a nod, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1698.738s">[Bears]</a>: Next item is the good landlord tax credit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1701.14s">[Bears]</a>: We actually have reviewed this and found that the way that the state law was structured makes this a really actually unappealing credit to implement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1710.245s">[Bears]</a>: So it's probably not something we're going to move forward with, at least the discussions that we have with the assessor, or that this would be of great benefit to essentially only the very, very large commercial property, well,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1724.255s">[Bears]</a>: residential property owners, but the companies that own large multi-unit buildings and would not really be of benefit for our two-family, three-family landlords.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1737.188s">[Bears]</a>: That was really frustrating to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1741.472s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan, did you want to talk on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1782.439s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I think that we could reach out to the assessor's office and maybe try to get a written update for sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1787.523s">[Bears]</a>: Matt and I had a couple meetings, or Matt had some conversations, I had some conversations, and sure, we could pull together some information from those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1797.128s">[Bears]</a>: share that with the rest of the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1802.11s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1803.451s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just going to zoom through the rest of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1805.311s">[Bears]</a>: Oh, go ahead, Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1850.405s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1851.445s">[Bears]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1852.226s">[Bears]</a>: No action is being taken at this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1854.811s">[Bears]</a>: Um, this is just, uh, updating the document and kind of reviewing our progress on these different items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1860.274s">[Bears]</a>: And, um, I think it would be good for all of our committees at some point this spring to maybe have a little bit of a. A clean up session at 1 of their meetings as well and, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1869.978s">[Bears]</a>: Either receiving place on file any papers that won't be moving forward or.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1874.96s">[Bears]</a>: Otherwise, refer things to new committees if it seems like they should be going there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1880.157s">[Bears]</a>: For the rest of this, I'll just go quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1881.959s">[Bears]</a>: We also, in the future, would like to look at a Community Benefits Agreement ordinance around having a Community Benefits Committee that negotiates with very large real estate projects and nonprofits around what the needs assessment for our neighborhoods is and figuring out how that would work in alignment with our zoning process and also with the Community Development Board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1907.395s">[Bears]</a>: We have a look at a percent for art ordinance that was proposed many years ago, which would create a requirement that 1% of costs would be earmarked for public art projects for large developments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1924.27s">[Bears]</a>: So that's something we could look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1925.371s">[Bears]</a>: We could also look at that probably in the context of our zoning project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1930.714s">[Bears]</a>: President Morell and I proposed looking at paid family medical leave for our city employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1936.217s">[Bears]</a>: I think that's something I really want to talk about in our budget cycle this year to see if that's a possibility, as well as extended illness leave bank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1945.283s">[Bears]</a>: And then beyond that, the committee has advocated for pilot legislation requiring large nonprofits like Tufts University to pay a fair share in property taxes, as well as our general<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1958.368s">[Bears]</a>: review of the city's finances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1959.569s">[Bears]</a>: We do receive monthly warrant articles and regular financial updates and, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1966.494s">[Bears]</a>: Reviewing the city ordinances as named here as needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1970.517s">[Bears]</a>: I'll go to Councilors are and then Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1990.611s">[Bears]</a>: So the enabling, the city council is the authority to vote to implement the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1999.676s">[Bears]</a>: City council by majority vote can enter into the state's paid family medical leave program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2004.898s">[Bears]</a>: It would initially, it would require the city to budget for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2008.08s">[Bears]</a>: So there'd be a budget impact, which a couple of years ago, Director Dickinson estimated within the $500,000 to $1 million per year range.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2016.929s">[Bears]</a>: may also have collective bargaining impacts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2018.95s">[Bears]</a>: So those are some of the questions we'd wanna discuss with the administration if we were gonna move forward with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2026.673s">[Bears]</a>: But we can vote to enter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2033.717s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2061.218s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I think we'll see that in committee of the whole sometime in the first couple months of the year around the stabilization fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2067.481s">[Bears]</a>: And I think we may also expect an update to the capital improvement plan, which will be an even longer outlook as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2075.865s">[Bears]</a>: You got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2076.745s">[Bears]</a>: All right, I'm going to turn it over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2078.286s">[Bears]</a>: Well, the next committee was education and culture committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2080.667s">[Bears]</a>: That's Councilor Scarpelli as the chair who's not present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2086.049s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think this committee met this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2088.35s">[Bears]</a>: It had a couple<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2090.732s">[Bears]</a>: One item looking to identify public internship opportunities for students that Councilor Tseng has been proposed and wanted to work on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2102.496s">[Bears]</a>: And I will on this 1, I will recognize guest on for public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2108.378s">[Bears]</a>: 3 minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2146.113s">[Bears]</a>: So that, uh, there was a vote to revert that to, um, uh, essentially it was reverted back to the city for use for ARPA related purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2157.336s">[Bears]</a>: Um, uh, the mayor, we would have to talk to the mayor about, uh, exactly specifically how it's going to be spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2163.598s">[Bears]</a>: All ARPA funds need to be encumbered by December 31st of this year per the federal law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2169.234s">[Bears]</a>: The mayor did notify us that about 850,000 of that maybe a little bit more was utilized to purchase a new fire truck that was essentially the city of Lynn had purchased a fire truck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2185.712s">[Bears]</a>: that was not able to fit in their fire stations but does fit in our fire stations and we were able to purchase that truck and that was a really big windfall because not necessarily from a money perspective but from a time perspective because right now it takes between 36 and 60 months to get a fire truck to the city and we're going to get a new vehicle engine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2210.898s">[Bears]</a>: right away because it's already been delivered to Lynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2213.079s">[Bears]</a>: So I do know that is one item we received specifically that this funding was going towards, and the mayor said in a communication to us when we did the supplemental appropriation vote that those funds would go essentially towards capital priorities and other items in the capital plan so that they'd be expended before December 31st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2234.503s">[Bears]</a>: But the mayor, I believe, is going to release a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2238.539s">[Bears]</a>: detailed final reporting on ARPA funding after the after December 31st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2294.318s">[Bears]</a>: told us in public meetings and committed to, at least in conversation with me, they're gonna try to spend every last dollar that's available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2301.283s">[Bears]</a>: And that's definitely the goal that I want to hold them to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2306.207s">[Bears]</a>: Okay, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2307.028s">[Bears]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2308.449s">[Bears]</a>: You got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2309.169s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2355.056s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2388.824s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, and there was a communication or discussion, I believe, around the paper itself that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2396.764s">[Bears]</a>: there were projects in the pipeline that may have been asked for funds from the capital stabilization fund or another source that instead this ARPA money will be able to go towards, such as that fire engine, which it wasn't, you know, there are several fire apparatuses in the capital improvement plan along with, I think the mayor may have mentioned police cruisers and a couple of other items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2421.136s">[Bears]</a>: There was a written document somewhere in a packet that we received.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2429.005s">[Bears]</a>: go to the governance committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2430.126s">[Bears]</a>: This is alphabetically convenient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2432.467s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Tseng is also not present, so I can handle that quickly, and then we can go to our last four committees here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2439.612s">[Bears]</a>: But this committee focuses on basically rules, charter, elections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2444.335s">[Bears]</a>: The two projects that really have been worked on or are being planned to be worked on are updates to our city charter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2451.34s">[Bears]</a>: We did have some preliminary meetings beginning earlier this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2456.542s">[Bears]</a>: some prior to September and then starting in October and November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2460.523s">[Bears]</a>: And we just received the draft proposal from the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2465.565s">[Bears]</a>: So we have that and we will be considering in the new year in January and February and maybe into March some amendments to that proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2479.589s">[Bears]</a>: And then getting that to the mayor and getting the mayor to get that to the legislature so that the legislature can pass it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2485.245s">[Bears]</a>: in time for it to be on the ballot in November of 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2487.767s">[Bears]</a>: And if the voters were to approve it at that point, it would go into effect for the following election in 2027.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2495.093s">[Bears]</a>: So that's another huge, exciting project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2498.976s">[Bears]</a>: I do want to thank the Starter Study Committee and the mayor and the Collins Center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2503.88s">[Bears]</a>: I know there will be some changes, maybe significant changes that we choose to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2509.164s">[Bears]</a>: You know, we are the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2511.923s">[Bears]</a>: the first elected officials taking a look at this after the mayor and, you know, we, it requires a super majority vote of this body to approve and we are the legislative body of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2521.61s">[Bears]</a>: So our voice is very important in this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2525.653s">[Bears]</a>: And I believe we will also, speaking with Councilor Hsuang, who's the chair of this committee, and I believe I'm his vice chair, we will be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2537.492s">[Bears]</a>: probably soliciting some feedback from our multi-member boards and commissions, as well as the school committee, maybe some other folks as well, just so that if they want to have a voice as part of this process, as the sitting school committee and boards and commissions, we'll be able to incorporate some of their recommendations and changes as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2564.251s">[Bears]</a>: All right, I'll turn it over to VP Collins, planning and permitting committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2590.111s">[Bears]</a>: 16, so only 16?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2591.251s">[Bears]</a>: Wow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3228.153s">[Bears]</a>: I'll go to Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3270.973s">[Bears]</a>: I think it'd probably fall under the administration and finance committee, but also probably would end up mostly ending up being implemented in committee of the whole, would be my guess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3282.881s">[Bears]</a>: My best thinking at the time, and maybe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3285.802s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Clerk, if you could put in the report a note that we want to add the residential exemption in to this document, I think that's a really great flag, Anna.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3293.592s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks, Mr. Clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3295.074s">[Bears]</a>: And I'll go to Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3369.809s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, that's a great flag.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3372.918s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Collins, you have a thought on that or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3412.426s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, and I think we could, you know, definitely for those resolutions where it just goes to a regular meeting and gets done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3419.09s">[Bears]</a>: If folks want to see that included in here, either as an accomplishment, something that's been completed or something that's initiated a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3426.84s">[Bears]</a>: project that didn't go to committee, we could just, you know, get one-on-one email the two of us and we can figure out either if it should go into a committee and if that means we should refer it to committee or we can put it under committee of the whole or we could even create another section for regular meeting items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3445.061s">[Bears]</a>: Council is all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3507.045s">[Bears]</a>: Got it, great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3508.385s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3526.192s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, it sounds like in a lot of cases, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3529.913s">[Bears]</a>: I just wanted to note on these planning and permitting items,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3533.899s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan, I'd love to work with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3536.64s">[Bears]</a>: I've had some meetings with Quentin Zondervan and some other folks around benchmarking and disclosure and some other items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3544.804s">[Bears]</a>: And I'd love to loop in with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3546.885s">[Bears]</a>: I know we're gonna have a conversation in the next couple of weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3552.648s">[Bears]</a>: So that's something we could talk about, but I think some exciting things there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3557.11s">[Bears]</a>: So just wanted to note that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3559.752s">[Bears]</a>: And I actually, awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3563.277s">[Bears]</a>: I apologize to my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3565.621s">[Bears]</a>: I need to step out of this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3567.484s">[Bears]</a>: I really apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3569.848s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Collins, if you could take over from here, if that's all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3574.356s">[Bears]</a>: I just wanted to thank<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3576.625s">[Bears]</a>: of my colleagues for a great year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3579.828s">[Bears]</a>: I will watch the rest of this meeting for the last committees for the work they're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3584.271s">[Bears]</a>: I know so much is getting done in all of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3587.373s">[Bears]</a>: And there's a lot more that folks are excited to do in the new year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3590.195s">[Bears]</a>: So thank you, Councilors Lazzaro, Callahan and Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3593.438s">[Bears]</a>: I apologize that I won't be here to hear the rest of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3597.133s">[Bears]</a>: just putting a link in the chat for you, Vice President Collins, and you can take a stone, but you're in charge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3605.806s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3606.487s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=619.665s">[Bears]</a>: 24th regular meeting Medford City Council December 17 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=623.726s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=638.311s">[Bears]</a>: The meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=639.192s">[Bears]</a>: Please rise to salute the flag.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=654.229s">[Bears]</a>: Before we start, this is our last meeting of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=657.13s">[Bears]</a>: And I do ask my colleagues for limited indulgence and welcome the crowd for being here as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=665.111s">[Bears]</a>: I just wanna thank my colleagues for an incredible 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=668.452s">[Bears]</a>: It's been a busy year of nearly a hundred meetings of this body and committee and in regular session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=677.194s">[Bears]</a>: And I don't think anyone can say that this council has not been outspoken and spoken its mind on a variety of topics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=683.888s">[Bears]</a>: In January, I spoke about three leadership principles, collaboration, planning, and trust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=689.973s">[Bears]</a>: This council has worked together collaboratively within our committees with the city administration, city staff, community organizations, businesses, educational institutions, and thousands of residents to implement and discuss a clear and transparent governing agenda created and published in February.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=710.117s">[Bears]</a>: Tomorrow night we're going to conduct our one year review of that plan and suggest updates for the year ahead and I encourage everyone in our city to join us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=719.16s">[Bears]</a>: I firmly believe that this open and direct approach to governance is foundational to good governance and to trust, and I'm going to continue to lead with these principles in 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=730.365s">[Bears]</a>: There's always disagreement, and we've had some tough meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=734.761s">[Bears]</a>: I'm always open to meet with anyone, whether that's Councilors, residents, employees of the city and others to hear from them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=741.665s">[Bears]</a>: And of course, this council will always hear from anyone who speaks at this podium under our rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=747.509s">[Bears]</a>: I'm excited for 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=750.65s">[Bears]</a>: Earlier this week, released our January to June schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=753.872s">[Bears]</a>: There are 60 meetings scheduled on topics including the budget, a new city charter, zoning and much more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=762.284s">[Bears]</a>: And I really just want to implore and invite the community to join us in the process of building a better Medford together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=768.776s">[Bears]</a>: So thank you for your indulgence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=770.479s">[Bears]</a>: And with that, we'll move to the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=774.44s">[Bears]</a>: Announcements, accolades, remembrances, reports, and records.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=778.303s">[Bears]</a>: 24-512 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=781.946s">[Bears]</a>: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council commend and congratulate Barbara Kerr for her 40 years of tireless and selfless service at the Medford Public Library.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1036.397s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Collins, and I just want to note certainly to thank Barbara, and I think Barbara would also want us to thank her staff, the trustees, the Library Foundation, which has been so instrumental in the construction of and outfitting of the new library, the friends of the Medford Public Library, and all of the folks who walk through those doors or use the online resources or take out a book<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1063.329s">[Bears]</a>: or other material at the library has really become so much more than just a place to go and get a book, but it really provides essential community services to so many people in our community, especially our kids and our teens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1075.975s">[Bears]</a>: So just thank you to Barbara and the whole library team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1527.917s">[Bears]</a>: Dear President Bears and members of the city council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the below loan order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1534.52s">[Bears]</a>: By way of some background, the Andrews and McGlynn Middle Schools are in need of extensive HVAC work, as well as at least repairs to the McGlynn School roof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1541.102s">[Bears]</a>: The city has hired an owner's project manager and designer with the goal of conducting the majority of the construction work during the summer months to further the project and keep the timetable for construction<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1550.342s">[Bears]</a>: In January, the city needs to pre-order equipment, continue to design with the designer and OPM and the pre-construction services of the construction manager to accomplish this, a fundering authorization of about $5 million is needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1561.671s">[Bears]</a>: In the future, after further designing cost estimates have been finalized, we will likely return for the rest of the cost to complete construction, which is expected to be about an additional $20 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1571.42s">[Bears]</a>: City of Medford loan order, school HVAC infrastructure and roof bonds, be it ordered that $5 million is appropriated for the purpose of replacing boilers and cooling systems with new condensing boilers and heat pumps, including associated automatic controls, structural and architectural work, electrical work and weatherization at the McGlynn School and Andrew School, and the acquisition and installation of solar panels for a new roof and a new roof or roof repairs at the McGlynn School, including the cost of planning, design, architectural and engineering services and all other costs incidental and related thereto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1601.76s">[Bears]</a>: And that this appropriation to meet this appropriation the treasurer, with the approval of the mayor is authorized to borrow the set amount pursuant to chapter 44 section seven subsection one of the Massachusetts general laws or pursuant to any other enabling authority, and to issue the bonds or notes of the city therefore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1617.398s">[Bears]</a>: and further ordered that the treasurer is authorized to file an application with the appropriate officials of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the Commonwealth to qualify under chapter 44A of the general laws, any and all bonds of the city authorized to be borrowed pursuant to this loan order and to provide such information and execute such documents as officials of the Commonwealth may require in connection therewith.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1639.163s">[Bears]</a>: We have Director Hunt and Assistant Superintendent Cushing with us tonight to further discuss the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1760.851s">[Bears]</a>: And just to confirm the school committee did discuss this last night and there was a vote of the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1779.383s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1779.843s">[Bears]</a>: With that, I will go to the council for questions and further discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1902.745s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1903.105s">[Bears]</a>: Before I recognize Councilor Collins and Councilor Callahan, I do just want to note on the ARPA funding that has to be encumbered by December 31st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1912.251s">[Bears]</a>: And we did receive a communication from the mayor at a large chunk of that 800,000 plus dollars that we were able to buy a fire engine from the city of Lynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1921.796s">[Bears]</a>: So there's a new fire engine coming through that money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1925.018s">[Bears]</a>: So a large chunk of that money has been appropriated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1927.9s">[Bears]</a>: It does have to be encumbered by the end of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1929.601s">[Bears]</a>: I'll go to Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2443.287s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Cushing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2444.127s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think anyone's excited for the 30 percent cost increases we're all about to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2448.071s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2529.688s">[Bears]</a>: Is there a second on that motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2530.728s">[Bears]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2532.929s">[Bears]</a>: Several.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2936.817s">[Bears]</a>: Should they submit them to you Director Hunt and Assistant Superintendent Cushing directly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2940.678s">[Bears]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2943.039s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins, do you have anything further?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2947.403s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3011.383s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, and I know you guys wanted to maybe respond or answer any further questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3015.026s">[Bears]</a>: I just wanted to note that this project has been on the radar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3018.008s">[Bears]</a>: It was in a previous capital improvement plan, and it was one of the reasons for the question six vote, because it was a large project that came up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3028.675s">[Bears]</a>: The proposed question six did not succeed, but it was why it was on the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3112.81s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3158.697s">[Bears]</a>: I believe the materials are available in the school committee packet from last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3162.941s">[Bears]</a>: I'll defer to Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3167.304s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3167.664s">[Bears]</a>: Director Hunt, do you have an answer to that question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3169.766s">[Bears]</a>: Or Mr. Ellis?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3175.31s">[Bears]</a>: You need to speak into the microphone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3177.552s">[Bears]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3190.612s">[Bears]</a>: But it's on the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3191.552s">[Bears]</a>: It was considered by the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3192.913s">[Bears]</a>: It's on the school website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3208.24s">[Bears]</a>: But it will be posted on the Medford Public Schools website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3267.311s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3269.855s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3270.416s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3272.018s">[Bears]</a>: Is your email pcushing at medford.k12.ma.us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3274.963s">[Bears]</a>: It is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3275.184s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3278.815s">[Bears]</a>: Any further public comments, name and address for the record please you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3336.847s">[Bears]</a>: My understanding is a feasibility study was conducted, and I'll leave the specifics to Dr. Cushing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3627.089s">[Bears]</a>: It sounds like it's fair to say that maximizing the lifespan, minimizing the cost, and maximizing the efficiency of this project has been the touchstone of the feasibility study and the design process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3639.013s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3686.456s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3687.957s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing no hands on Zoom, we'll go to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3689.699s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3690.74s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3741.06s">[Bears]</a>: My understanding, and I'm sure Dr. Cushing and Director Hunt can add to it, is that federal money has been used up until this point to fund the process up until this point, the federal ARPA money that came to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3752.889s">[Bears]</a>: and there's not really private grants out there for this kind of project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3757.193s">[Bears]</a>: And also I believe it was presented to the school committee that the MSBA was approached and they said that this project wouldn't apply under the MSBA, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3894.52s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4836.052s">[Bears]</a>: First, I was on the bond rating we received a message from the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4839.935s">[Bears]</a>: Hello President Bears and city council members after a great deal of preparation and bond rating call last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4845.098s">[Bears]</a>: I'm pleased to report that our a three bond rating was reaffirmed by Moody's financial services company upon receiving updated documentation related to our fiscal year 23 audit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4854.805s">[Bears]</a>: As you're likely aware the AA3 rating is regarded as a quote high grade rating and per Moody's analysis the city is in line for an elevated credit rating in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4863.788s">[Bears]</a>: You can read about Moody's outlook on the city's financial health and borrowing strength in a press release on the city website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4869.469s">[Bears]</a>: While this is welcome news it comes with opportunities for us to shore up our financial reporting operations and strive to increase our rating in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4876.011s">[Bears]</a>: If you have any questions please feel free to contact my office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4880.196s">[Bears]</a>: We then also received a message regarding Council Resolution 24518, which is what we're currently considering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4887.358s">[Bears]</a>: The mayor said, hello, President Bears, I wanted to provide some insight on Council Resolution 24518.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4891.139s">[Bears]</a>: Quote, my responsibility as mayor is to the residents and taxpayers of the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4896.6s">[Bears]</a>: When I receive allegations from multiple parties alleging various employee matters, including potential misconduct, fraud, et cetera, I believe our community expects that I investigate these allegations to the fullest extent possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4907.603s">[Bears]</a>: Additionally, depending on the specific nature of the allegations at issue, our human resources department does not have the bandwidth to undertake investigations that are broad in scope or are too cumbersome that such efforts would impede daily office duties and responsibilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4920.705s">[Bears]</a>: Also, as it relates to school items, please refer all school matters to the school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4925.066s">[Bears]</a>: With respect to the portion of the proposed resolution pertaining to drug testing, this is a confidential personnel matter and due to individual privacy considerations, we cannot comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4933.487s">[Bears]</a>: If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4937.318s">[Bears]</a>: Brianna Lugo, current mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4947.123s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4973.659s">[Bears]</a>: It says, as it relates to school items, please refer school matters to the school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4977.819s">[Bears]</a>: That's what the email says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4979.06s">[Bears]</a>: So we can send requests to the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6294.99s">[Bears]</a>: We've heard a case has been made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6297.654s">[Bears]</a>: Folks have had an experience and said they had an experience that they felt very uncomfortable and felt was unjust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6303.584s">[Bears]</a>: We've heard that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6304.645s">[Bears]</a>: We have a short response from the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6307.429s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to guess that most of the people behind this rail would like to learn more about what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6312.252s">[Bears]</a>: And also just to be honest and direct, our role in this process is we do not, I am not the boss of any employee in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6319.617s">[Bears]</a>: No one behind this rail is the manager of any employee in the city, except for this person right next to us is the only person in the city who works for the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6327.562s">[Bears]</a>: Everybody else who works for the city of Medford works for the mayor of Medford or the superintendent of schools of the Medford public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6334.927s">[Bears]</a>: So that's the role that we play here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6338.01s">[Bears]</a>: I'm sure many of us would feel dismayed and feel that the experience that was described by the representative was not something that they would want to go through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6345.578s">[Bears]</a>: I think everyone in the crowd would probably say the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6349.022s">[Bears]</a>: Now the rest of the facts that come out of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6351.724s">[Bears]</a>: We don't know all the answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6352.985s">[Bears]</a>: We just have what has been presented so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6355.908s">[Bears]</a>: And our action simply would be to say, we do not like that you did that mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6360.452s">[Bears]</a>: When we talk about accountability for the mayor, that happens at the ballot box every two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6365.376s">[Bears]</a>: And that is how she's held accountable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6368.959s">[Bears]</a>: Beyond that, there is nothing in the city charter, the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, federal law that empowers this council to order the mayor to not do what she did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6378.992s">[Bears]</a>: The union has filed a suit, as is their right, on behalf of their members, disputing what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6386.218s">[Bears]</a>: Individuals filed the suit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6387.339s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6387.679s">[Bears]</a>: Then the individuals filed the suit themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6389.501s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6389.841s">[Bears]</a>: And the representative presented it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6391.822s">[Bears]</a>: I assumed that Teamsters Local 25 represented, but the members have filed suit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6396.026s">[Bears]</a>: That's their right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6397.146s">[Bears]</a>: Beyond that, their recourse is we can hear facts here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6399.889s">[Bears]</a>: We can hear statements made here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6401.63s">[Bears]</a>: People can speak at the podium and the Councilors can look for additional information, but that's why we're having the discussion that we're having.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6410.277s">[Bears]</a>: And no one behind the rail is obligated at this point to say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6413.672s">[Bears]</a>: their opinion, whether they feel like they have enough information to make an informed discussion, all I can say is that the experience that was described is not something I would want to experience, and I'm sure we all would like to find out more information about why it happened and to make sure that whatever recourse is available to the people who experienced it is there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6433.726s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6434.226s">[Bears]</a>: And one of the reasons that we have rules is so that we maintain decorum and that I can explain the process and what this council has the power to do and not do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6443.249s">[Bears]</a>: So I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6445.969s">[Bears]</a>: I'll go to Zoom and then we'll come back to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6449.07s">[Bears]</a>: On Zoom, we have Nadeen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6450.411s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6451.831s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6468.574s">[Bears]</a>: Nadeen, we can hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6469.455s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6556.527s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6557.048s">[Bears]</a>: Um, we'll go to the podium, name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6559.65s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Castagnetti, you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6595.567s">[Bears]</a>: I believe the representative from Local 25 said that a needle was found, an unused needle was found in the bathroom at the DPW facility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6616.151s">[Bears]</a>: I do not have information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6618.032s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, I don't have that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6619.273s">[Bears]</a>: Um, all I have is the statement that we received from the mayor, their resolution by the Councilor and what we've heard at the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6627.078s">[Bears]</a>: I was, I've heard from the representative that it was at, uh, the DPW bathroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6634.543s">[Bears]</a>: At James street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6636.144s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6641.431s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6642.372s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6759.393s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6759.854s">[Bears]</a>: Any further comment by members of the public?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6765.877s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6766.818s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes, Nate, and I'll wait till you get to the phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6802.719s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Martin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6803.38s">[Bears]</a>: In terms of the specifics, I mean, it sounds like this is going to be litigated and evidence will be presented on that litigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6811.746s">[Bears]</a>: Any further public comments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6815.489s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, I will go to Councilor Callahan and then Councilor Scarpelli and then Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6821.153s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6825.176s">[Bears]</a>: Oops, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6862.089s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just going to take the discussion that's on the table and then we can take any motions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6872.113s">[Bears]</a>: Go to Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7279.005s">[Bears]</a>: I would just note that we have received<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7283.001s">[Bears]</a>: dozens of warrant articles, multiple reports about the legal costs paid out by the city, from the city administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7289.225s">[Bears]</a>: It's public documents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7291.506s">[Bears]</a>: We can provide them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7292.447s">[Bears]</a>: They're sent to us by email on a monthly basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7294.588s">[Bears]</a>: The administration can provide them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7297.13s">[Bears]</a>: And the city has never spent more than the budgeted amount for the law department, budgeted in our fiscal year budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7306.616s">[Bears]</a>: there has been no additional spending or major financial impact on the city beyond the legal budget that is budgeted every year through the fiscal year budget process and that is proven out by the financial documents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7322.701s">[Bears]</a>: I'm speaking right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7323.581s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7328.86s">[Bears]</a>: Any further comments from members of council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7330.221s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to go to Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7333.082s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to go to Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7334.723s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7335.484s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7394.708s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Leming has invoked rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7396.73s">[Bears]</a>: I think we have a number of financial items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7405.097s">[Bears]</a>: We talked about, we talked about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7408.786s">[Bears]</a>: Hold on a minute, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7409.547s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7410.147s">[Bears]</a>: Cost associated with terminating the school and superintendent's contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7414.21s">[Bears]</a>: Finance director appeared articulate dropping bond rating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7418.993s">[Bears]</a>: Utilization of a complete financial report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7420.874s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, there's multiple financial items in this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7427.495s">[Bears]</a>: I'll read the rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7451.444s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just, I'm... Any councillor...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7455.615s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to read the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7457.176s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to read the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7457.997s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7461.46s">[Bears]</a>: We'll take a look and I can ask for an interpretation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7463.882s">[Bears]</a>: Oh, that's our parliamentarian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7469.727s">[Bears]</a>: The clerk needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7471.028s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7483.834s">[Bears]</a>: does any finance paper related?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7520.55s">[Bears]</a>: Please hold on a minute, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7522.271s">[Bears]</a>: Please just take a breath.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7526.073s">[Bears]</a>: If we would be willing to discuss the financial elements or sever out the financial elements of the paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7532.424s">[Bears]</a>: Um, the rule is really broad and it's been used incredibly broadly in this council for a very long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7537.807s">[Bears]</a>: So, um, yeah, it has been several times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7543.81s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7545.951s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7550.653s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7559.411s">[Bears]</a>: What are you talking about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7562.752s">[Bears]</a>: You have done rule 21 multiple times as well, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7567.292s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7569.453s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to rule that we're not going to invoke rule 21 if we sever out financial elements from non-financial elements of the paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7575.474s">[Bears]</a>: Is there a motion to sever the paper into at least elements regarding finances and non-finances?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7582.855s">[Bears]</a>: Or does the Councilor want to pull back rule 21?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7595.929s">[Bears]</a>: On a motion to question the ruling of the chair by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by, seconded by Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7604.536s">[Bears]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7604.716s">[Bears]</a>: Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7613.603s">[Bears]</a>: I'm not sure what the motion is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7614.724s">[Bears]</a>: It's just a...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7622.473s">[Bears]</a>: I have said that I believe that there are financial elements to this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7634.46s">[Bears]</a>: My ruling that there are finance elements to the paper that rule 21 would apply here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7639.383s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7668.345s">[Bears]</a>: Sounds like there's two options in front of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7670.885s">[Bears]</a>: One is I have ruled that there are financial elements to this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7675.086s">[Bears]</a>: Um, we could move forward with questioning that, that any of this counts as a finance paper, um, or we could consider the motion to sever prior to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7685.388s">[Bears]</a>: Uh, that's up to, um, councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7690.769s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan did indicate their decision wanting a motion to sever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7696.95s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7698.821s">[Bears]</a>: um then uh there's but it was after the second there was already a motion to question the ruling of the chair the motion to sever was was that we would do it after discussion you didn't make a motion to sever you said it was a recommended course of action there was no second there's a second emotion to overrule the ruling of the chair that there are financial elements in this paper that qualify under rule 21<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7728.962s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7730.022s">[Bears]</a>: If they want to reach out to me now, I would be happy to hear their interpretation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7741.25s">[Bears]</a>: Is there further discussion on the motion of question really in the chair?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7797.918s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7798.458s">[Bears]</a>: And I would just note that I am actually operating under<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7802.332s">[Bears]</a>: legal opinions that I received that rule 21 stems from the charter right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7806.173s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli invoked the charter right in June, and I had to go to legal counsel to discuss that charter right, and legal counsel informed me that the charter right under this rule applies to any motion, order, or resolution under consideration by the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7821.277s">[Bears]</a>: So it's kind of a catch-22 situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7823.798s">[Bears]</a>: I don't like it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7824.578s">[Bears]</a>: It's one of the reasons I think we need to have a charter change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7828.504s">[Bears]</a>: And I believe I misinterpreted it last time by being too restrictive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7831.705s">[Bears]</a>: And that's why I'm not being restrictive now, based on advice of counsel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7837.647s">[Bears]</a>: So, we are where we are because this has been invoked multiple times by multiple Councilors, and given the council opinion that I received in July.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7847.512s">[Bears]</a>: I believe that under mass general law is the charter that's been adopted by the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7851.394s">[Bears]</a>: The interpretation that I received from the city's legal counsel was that literally any paper could be postponed by any Councilor until the next meeting for any reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7858.019s">[Bears]</a>: So, um, huh?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7864.002s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, it wasn't from the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7864.963s">[Bears]</a>: It was from the council at KP law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7868.825s">[Bears]</a>: So, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7871.786s">[Bears]</a>: We could take a motion on the ruling of the chair, but again, that's the council advice that advice I received from council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7876.75s">[Bears]</a>: I've been on both sides of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7877.851s">[Bears]</a>: I was too restrictive last time when I ruled something one way, and now I'm trying to go the other way because of the advice I received.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7895.184s">[Bears]</a>: He said that he wanted more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7896.685s">[Bears]</a>: He wanted more time to receive more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7898.286s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know if he can speak to it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7901.545s">[Bears]</a>: If we want to go on the motion overall, the ruling of the chair by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Callahan, that's the motion that's on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7908.13s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli has not withdrawn, so I will take the vote on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7916.917s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7926.724s">[Bears]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7932.775s">[Bears]</a>: I can't vote to overrule my own ruling, can I?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7940.121s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to vote yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7945.705s">[Bears]</a>: Actually, that's a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7947.206s">[Bears]</a>: I will vote present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7948.107s">[Bears]</a>: 3-3, the motion fails.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7949.988s">[Bears]</a>: So we'll go to the next motion, which is the motion to sever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7960.339s">[Bears]</a>: Is there a motion, there's a motion to sever, Councilor Callahan, do you want to go further into that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7974.321s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7997.722s">[Bears]</a>: So they're divided by topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7999.584s">[Bears]</a>: The motions would be the first vote would be on requesting those from the school department, the following information, the cost associated with terminating the school superintendent's contract, course communications, correspondence, meeting minutes, records, and reports regarding the separation and the anticipated costs of the search committee and interim appointment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8018.103s">[Bears]</a>: All right, the second is the finance director appear before the council to articulate a plan to restore the bond rating that was amended, I believe by Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8028.253s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8029.093s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8040.355s">[Bears]</a>: The third one is regarding private investigators and resolve that the administration report back to the council that identified line in the budget where we are paying private investigators and a complete financial report from the start of this practice to the present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8053.881s">[Bears]</a>: And then the fourth is the administrative reporting to the council on the cost of questionable drug testing and a report outlining the reasons for these tests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8062.724s">[Bears]</a>: I'm being further resolve the council move to executive session if the issues are confidential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8068.507s">[Bears]</a>: Does that sound right, Councilor Collins?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8070.389s">[Bears]</a>: Is there a second on the motion to sever?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8071.691s">[Bears]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8073.573s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion to sever by Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8076.556s">[Bears]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8076.617s">[Bears]</a>: Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8080.421s">[Bears]</a>: Before we call the roll, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8111.436s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli has struck that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8113.458s">[Bears]</a>: So on the motion to sever as amended, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8139.009s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8140.57s">[Bears]</a>: Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8141.811s">[Bears]</a>: Motion severed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8142.412s">[Bears]</a>: Or is that 5-2?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8143.192s">[Bears]</a>: 6-1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8143.412s">[Bears]</a>: 6-1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8145.193s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8146.554s">[Bears]</a>: So we'll take the first one, which is regarding the cost associated in terminating the superintendent's contract and the anticipated cost of the superintendent search committee and interim appointment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8159.103s">[Bears]</a>: Any discussion on that item?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8162.825s">[Bears]</a>: I think we can label these 518A, B, C, and D.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8212.737s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8213.358s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion on that item?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8215.239s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Jones, do you want to talk about the superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8223.371s">[Bears]</a>: Is it regarding the bond rating, the private investigators, or the... Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8239.699s">[Bears]</a>: Let me just recognize you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8241.24s">[Bears]</a>: Public participation, three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8259.035s">[Bears]</a>: No, I said that what has been presented to the council and the legal fees paid to outside lawyers hasn't been paid out of the law budget and has not exceeded the law budget in any prior fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8270.746s">[Bears]</a>: based on the reports given to us by the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8280.313s">[Bears]</a>: It also includes ordinary expenses for settlements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8283.816s">[Bears]</a>: How much is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8285.056s">[Bears]</a>: I think it's $100,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8286.598s">[Bears]</a>: Very small, $100,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8288.099s">[Bears]</a>: It's a quarter to a fifth of the law department budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8340.295s">[Bears]</a>: From the discussions we've had and several of them in public session, there are claims paid by insurance that are paid by the city's insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8354.078s">[Bears]</a>: Which type of insurance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8356.739s">[Bears]</a>: I would have to look into the specific insurance policies that they're paid out under.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8367.728s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8372.871s">[Bears]</a>: We have been presented the warrant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8378.473s">[Bears]</a>: You can absolutely see the warrant articles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8379.734s">[Bears]</a>: What I'm telling you is that inside the warrant articles, there have not been settlements paid in those amounts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8383.916s">[Bears]</a>: So, they're not coming from the city's general fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8385.397s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8385.497s">[Bears]</a>: So, where are they coming from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8386.357s">[Bears]</a>: We have been advised by the administration that there have been settlements paid by the city's insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8391.58s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8392.16s">[Bears]</a>: So we have a policy with an insurance company that's paying these out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8394.923s">[Bears]</a>: There are several policies that the city has with insurance companies on a number of issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8398.826s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8402.69s">[Bears]</a>: The premiums for the insurance are paid and there's an insurance section in the city budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8501.837s">[Bears]</a>: It's not meant to be a back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8509.761s">[Bears]</a>: We do literally audited in the city ward articles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8512.863s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8513.623s">[Bears]</a>: We do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8514.223s">[Bears]</a>: It's not accurate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8522.427s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8522.728s">[Bears]</a>: Is there any further discussion on the item regarding the school superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8573.676s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Senna.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8577.198s">[Bears]</a>: And I just did pull up the Mass General Law, Chapter 43, Section 22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8582.703s">[Bears]</a>: which was invoked by Councilor Scarpelli in June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8587.889s">[Bears]</a>: I did seek legal counsel advice after my interpretation of that rule, and I would just say again, legal counsel essentially informed me that any member can postpone any resolution, motion, or order for any reason if they want to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8603.167s">[Bears]</a>: It's chapter 43, section 22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8605.828s">[Bears]</a>: He said rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8609.629s">[Bears]</a>: He didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8610.109s">[Bears]</a>: He didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8610.65s">[Bears]</a>: He didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8611.21s">[Bears]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8622.094s">[Bears]</a>: I sought further opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8627.247s">[Bears]</a>: I will say some other lawyers disagree with the interpretation of council, but I will go with the interpretation of the city's legal council, even if I don't agree with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8644.361s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion on the motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8647.264s">[Bears]</a>: Is there a motion to approve?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8649.426s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion of Councilor Collins to approve<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8716.149s">[Bears]</a>: This is regarding the bond rating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8720.46s">[Bears]</a>: Do we want to amend that to something else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8722.202s">[Bears]</a>: You had said earlier, Councilor Scarpel, you wanted to amend that to request a meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8733.611s">[Bears]</a>: So this is amended to be resolved that the City Council requests a report on why the bond rating was temporarily rescinded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8747.17s">[Bears]</a>: On that motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9343.588s">[Bears]</a>: So it sounds like the amended resolution is being resolved that the council requests the administration report on the city's drug policy and the cost of drug testing of employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9353.992s">[Bears]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9355.152s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9357.053s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Clerk, when you have that, let me know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9369.198s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Kelly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9378.934s">[Bears]</a>: I'll be honest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9379.855s">[Bears]</a>: I do not believe that we will ever receive that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9383.34s">[Bears]</a>: And I personally do not feel comfortable asking for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9416.679s">[Bears]</a>: What are Councilors saying?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9475.205s">[Bears]</a>: I would just note that regardless of any of that, this is very clearly the subject of litigation and the city will reply that because it's the subject of litigation, they're not going to be providing any information that could be detrimental to their case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9488.191s">[Bears]</a>: So if we could stick to things<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9491.758s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9492.958s">[Bears]</a>: So we're going to stick to the drug policy and the cost associated with drug testing employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9501.742s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9668.236s">[Bears]</a>: I'm not sure what the executive session exemption would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9670.577s">[Bears]</a>: I think we're going to have to consult council on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9679.66s">[Bears]</a>: I believe we move forward with this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9682.664s">[Bears]</a>: Did we make a motion to request a meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9819.672s">[Bears]</a>: And the amended resolution is to, uh, request a committee of the whole meeting and to determine on advice of legal counsel, uh, whether or not, uh, the city council can enter executive session to discuss elements of that report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10365.625s">[Bears]</a>: This is for final approval because there's not three readings on zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10369.546s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10370.99s">[Bears]</a>: Well, technically there's like five readings on zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10374.031s">[Bears]</a>: And this is the end of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10374.932s">[Bears]</a>: There's a lot of public hearings on zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10939.577s">[Bears]</a>: people who are unrelated are allowed to live in an apartment regardless of whether co-living as a specific use is allowed or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10944.041s">[Bears]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10967.928s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11185.978s">[Bears]</a>: And I would just point to the city's comprehensive plan talks about shared vision and values for the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11192.163s">[Bears]</a>: That's the document where a lot of the zoning comes from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11197.568s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please name, you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11254.426s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11257.128s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11258.209s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11289.197s">[Bears]</a>: Jamie, if you could get a little closer to the microphone and we're going to turn you up a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11374.066s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11376.387s">[Bears]</a>: Any further comments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11377.668s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11378.709s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11435.046s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I'm happy to answer that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11436.107s">[Bears]</a>: We're going to be considering the community solar program as the discussion and the zoning project continues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11442.833s">[Bears]</a>: We need to look into some specifics on it, but the plan is to include it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11448.058s">[Bears]</a>: Right now, I'm actually taking some information provided to me from some community activists, providing it to the zoning team that's working on this, and then it's likely that that, excuse me, will be included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11459.051s">[Bears]</a>: as an incentive piece across all of the districts where there's incentive zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11462.472s">[Bears]</a>: We just want to get it right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11465.053s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11469.994s">[Bears]</a>: Any further comment on this public hearing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11475.816s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11477.396s">[Bears]</a>: And you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11545.209s">[Bears]</a>: Uh thank you, Paulette.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11545.909s">[Bears]</a>: I just want to note both of those projects were private projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11548.87s">[Bears]</a>: So, the private property owner decided who they wanted to work with and then they were the ones who submitted the plans to the city and and the city doesn't have any choice as to who we would get to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11560.751s">[Bears]</a>: representing private property owners and they are allowed to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11563.803s">[Bears]</a>: petition the city within the zoning ordinance and the Massachusetts general laws for whatever they need to do on their private property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11570.267s">[Bears]</a>: So, so we don't have any.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11580.332s">[Bears]</a>: Only the private property landowner has the right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11582.553s">[Bears]</a>: They have their unlimited right to choose who they want to represent them when making petitions to the city regarding permits, licenses, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11590.417s">[Bears]</a>: We don't have any control over that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11607.601s">[Bears]</a>: That's, that's, um, pretty, pretty foundational, um, under the current way that the state and federal laws work for private property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11640.983s">[Bears]</a>: No, so that would be if the city owned land and was then trying to build a project in these areas, then we would have to go through this process, the bidding process procurement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11651.21s">[Bears]</a>: Zoning affects private property owners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11653.111s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, it affects public property nominally, but most of the property in the city is owned by private entities, individuals, corporations, groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11661.578s">[Bears]</a>: So when we change the zoning, that changes the laws about what we allow private property owners to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11668.042s">[Bears]</a>: um private property owners can pick any construction company any lawyer or any designer any architect that they want to make a proposal make a design um and the city just has the process of outlined here like a site plan review process or special permitting process<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11684.721s">[Bears]</a>: where the city has some limited, in some cases limited, in some cases significant discretionary choice as to what to allow, but we do not control who owns private property and we do not control who private property owners choose to hire to design projects, to construct projects, to make proposals to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11704.911s">[Bears]</a>: So, and I don't think there's any law that would allow us to change that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11717.696s">[Bears]</a>: I know that between the performance standards and the other things that are set in the zoning ordinance, the different boards, community development board especially, and other site plan review and special permit granting authorities will use the power allowed to us by the state zoning law to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11738.8s">[Bears]</a>: from these processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11743.964s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11745.025s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11766.462s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11767.143s">[Bears]</a>: Any further comment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11769.204s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11793.185s">[Bears]</a>: It's all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11793.926s">[Bears]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11797.068s">[Bears]</a>: It's chicken, man.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11797.828s">[Bears]</a>: There's not so much you can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11805.633s">[Bears]</a>: It is Councilor Lazzaro's birthday, so let's give a little.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11810.036s">[Bears]</a>: And we have a big crowd, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11813.558s">[Bears]</a>: I think she just doesn't want any more comments on the sauce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11881.232s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11883.473s">[Bears]</a>: Any further public comment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11884.673s">[Bears]</a>: I see one hand on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11885.773s">[Bears]</a>: I will go to, oh, that hand has gone down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11889.314s">[Bears]</a>: So I will, if there's no further public comment in this public hearing, I will declare the public hearing closed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11900.672s">[Bears]</a>: Any comments on the motion by Councilor Collins as amended by Councilor Callahan and seconded by Councilor Tseng to adopt the recommendations of the Community Development Board and to typos and strike line A8 of the use table Councilor Callahan<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12027.052s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12027.512s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12119.511s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12120.232s">[Bears]</a>: And I think, you know, appreciate that correction that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12124.09s">[Bears]</a>: There is one of the districts within this corridor, a sub-district that does allow special permit for the drive-thru, that's the commercial district, that is south of Mystic Valley Parkway-Harvard Street intersection and bordering the highway, which tends to be the area with the least possibility of becoming a more walkable area in this district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12143.849s">[Bears]</a>: The rest of the district is really primed for becoming a much safer and much less of a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12149.754s">[Bears]</a>: um strode as people call them which is a very very wide street that people drive down very very fast and is very very dangerous for anyone who's not in a car and quite frankly is dangerous for people who are in cars um so that is uh some of the values that we put in here um i just want to uh note that this is a long meeting um appreciate folks who've stuck around sometimes these kind of major changes get lost<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12172.893s">[Bears]</a>: in the sauce of meetings like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12174.454s">[Bears]</a>: That's happened really a lot this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12176.755s">[Bears]</a>: We've made a ton of progress this year, and this is a really important ordinance that I think, for me, advances values of safe, well-maintained, and climate-resilient streets and open spaces, housing affordability and stability, and a number of other values that I hold and that I know were part of the reason that I ran for office and continue to run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12203.812s">[Bears]</a>: It's a big moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12205.113s">[Bears]</a>: We have a motion to adopt this proposed amendment to the Medford Zoning Ordinance as amended by adopting the recommendations for amendment by the Community Development Board and the further amendments by Vice President Collins and Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12220.645s">[Bears]</a>: And that is as seconded by Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12222.666s">[Bears]</a>: So on this resolution, the first of many to come in this zoning updates project, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12244.346s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, it's the affirmative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12245.266s">[Bears]</a>: One of the negative, the motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12247.367s">[Bears]</a>: At this point, I would like to, quite frankly, given the late hour, I'd like to run a quick unofficial poll on the remaining items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12256.373s">[Bears]</a>: How many people are here for the special permit for signs at the Meadow Glen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12263.649s">[Bears]</a>: He's gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12264.37s">[Bears]</a>: So, all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12266.071s">[Bears]</a>: Is there a motion to table that to the next regular meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12271.054s">[Bears]</a>: It's a continuance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12281.806s">[Bears]</a>: All right, we'll do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12283.427s">[Bears]</a>: We'll do that and then I'll take my poll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12285.769s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion to continue the amendment to the special permit for signs, paper 24514 to the next regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12291.332s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12295.415s">[Bears]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12306.482s">[Bears]</a>: You want my job?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12307.963s">[Bears]</a>: You might both need to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12328.953s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12329.273s">[Bears]</a>: I've been affirming the negative motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12330.873s">[Bears]</a>: Let's continue to the next regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12332.214s">[Bears]</a>: 24, 516, Barry's back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12335.414s">[Bears]</a>: I think everything's in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12336.894s">[Bears]</a>: This is common victors license for Mrs. Murphy's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12339.535s">[Bears]</a>: Barry, if you want to talk about the business for a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12359.315s">[Bears]</a>: And this is a pub in Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12361.816s">[Bears]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12362.796s">[Bears]</a>: A pub in Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12364.817s">[Bears]</a>: They said it could never happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12368.619s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12369.78s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12429.888s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, we're working on that to wait a few months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12434.915s">[Bears]</a>: And I do want to recognize the clerk who rarely speaks but would like to speak tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12469.426s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12469.847s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, and I just want to echo that there are a lot of people in this building who have difficult jobs dealing with folks who want things to happen faster and when you hear from the clerk and representing his clerks about someone who<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12482.438s">[Bears]</a>: was calm and patient with the government process over many months, including tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12489.823s">[Bears]</a>: It doesn't go unnoticed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12515.998s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12544.098s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins, you're recognized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12547.721s">[Bears]</a>: Oh, you're recognized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12557.289s">[Bears]</a>: I'm guessing on the poll of the three items left, how many people are here for the Safe Communities Ordinance and the Community Control Republic Surveillance Ordinance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12563.694s">[Bears]</a>: If you could raise your hands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12565.475s">[Bears]</a>: How many folks are here on Tufts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12567.657s">[Bears]</a>: And how many folks are here on Salem Street Corridor referral?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12570.919s">[Bears]</a>: All right, got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12572.36s">[Bears]</a>: So, and that, if you could just move to take the, let's just get the folks out of here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12622.317s">[Bears]</a>: This is the welcoming city ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12627.76s">[Bears]</a>: Is there a motion to waive the reading in favor of a brief summary from the proponent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12632.583s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12635.605s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Clerk, once again, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12660.791s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, I have the affirmative and the negative, the motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12664.493s">[Bears]</a>: All right, so Councilor Tseng, if you want to give a summary and then we can move into Councilor discussion and then public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12671.357s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12842.042s">[Bears]</a>: It is visible on the screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13045.542s">[Bears]</a>: If I could just is it fair to say that these amendments reflect the view of legal counsel to ensure that this policy aligns with federal law while maintaining the intent and integrity of the Of the ordinance proposed and the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13061.38s">[Bears]</a>: policy that has been in place through the Medford Police Department for the last eight years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13134.515s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Lemmie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13135.256s">[Bears]</a>: If you could, um, save a copy of this with no track changes and submit a clean version to the clerk for inclusion in the council records, that would be much appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13146.499s">[Bears]</a>: And also we need it for the advertisement for second reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13151.921s">[Bears]</a>: With that, I will go to Councilor Lazzaro, then Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13222.414s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13222.774s">[Bears]</a>: I'll go to Councilor Scarpelli, then Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13224.756s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13578.786s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion of Councilor Collins to approve for first reading, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Sanz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13789.042s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13789.482s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13791.204s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13828.759s">[Bears]</a>: So, so, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13830.92s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13831.221s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13831.661s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13870.029s">[Bears]</a>: I believe he's been invited, but he can continue to be invited again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13872.61s">[Bears]</a>: I understand that, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13889.74s">[Bears]</a>: Because this is moving for a first reading, there can't be a committee meeting on it, but we could discuss it when it's up for third reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13898.305s">[Bears]</a>: We can't hold a committee meeting on a paper that's not in queue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13906.631s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, that whether you do or don't, it's not happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13912.736s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13914.597s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just saying it doesn't, there's no extra vote that's needed on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13917.66s">[Bears]</a>: So it doesn't save 10 seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13920.442s">[Bears]</a>: Um, any further discussion by members of the council, like councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14065.451s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14065.711s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion by members of the Council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14068.352s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just going to say very quickly that on this and the next ordinance, a very dangerous federal administration with a very particular and specific agenda is going to be coming into place in about a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14084.803s">[Bears]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14088.402s">[Bears]</a>: As a council, I think it is responsible and essential of us to act by passing a law that lets the people in this community know that the police of this city are not going to enact an agenda that weaponizes people's identities, people's documentation status, people's very livelihoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14112.175s">[Bears]</a>: And that is essential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14114.954s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, there might be consequences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14117.215s">[Bears]</a>: We may not get the FBI grant for, I don't know, whatever, more, we might not get the weapons that come for a discounted rate or something, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14128.18s">[Bears]</a>: These certain things that the Department of Justice and other agencies send to municipalities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14134.322s">[Bears]</a>: To me, that is a very small cost to standing up for what's right, standing up for our values and letting, again, the people of this community know that they will be safe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14144.13s">[Bears]</a>: If they want to report an incident to a Medford police officer, that they don't have to be afraid for their livelihoods and their ability to stay in this country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14154.756s">[Bears]</a>: If they want to be a witness in another case, if they just want to be a good citizen, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14160.659s">[Bears]</a>: And there's a lot of other reasons too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14163.661s">[Bears]</a>: Folks who are pulled over, folks who are questioned or whatever those might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14167.332s">[Bears]</a>: They shouldn't also have to have that added fear that they may well not be going home to their kids, because what we've heard over and over again in the last administration, and quite frankly, this administration seems dangerously more competent to implement this horrific agenda, is that kids went home after school and their parents were gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14184.096s">[Bears]</a>: And that's not something that we should have in this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14188.438s">[Bears]</a>: With that, I will go to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14190.078s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14191.278s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14296.684s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14297.764s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to switch to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14299.205s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Munir Germanis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14559.007s">[Bears]</a>: I will go to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14561.248s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14563.45s">[Bears]</a>: Jamie Tallarita, you have three minutes on this item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14578.784s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14581.866s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go back to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14974.541s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you so much, and good luck tomorrow morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14976.162s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to go to Zoom to the Reverend Wendy Villarola-Padre.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14981.928s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14983.169s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes, Reverend Wendy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14989.896s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15241.854s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15333.559s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15334.0s">[Bears]</a>: Go to the podium, name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15337.341s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15396.613s">[Bears]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15397.393s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Jean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15400.267s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Leming, do you want to, I really don't think, I would really prefer that you stop sharing the screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15406.012s">[Bears]</a>: At this point, I personally cannot handle looking at the lines of legal text.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15410.956s">[Bears]</a>: If you could explain changes or explain who you've communicated with about those changes beyond KP law, or that we could have a further discussion between now and the third reading, I think that would be my preference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15422.485s">[Bears]</a>: I just appreciate folks dealing with the fact that I just can't look at green line changes at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15459.474s">[Bears]</a>: or nodding yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15607.381s">[Bears]</a>: I think Matt, if you could read that sentence and then Jean, if you could read that existing sentence from the existing policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15723.442s">[Bears]</a>: Was the language that Councilor Leming read prior to the amendment received late today by KP Law in line with the policy in your opinion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15734.086s">[Bears]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15734.206s">[Bears]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15739.569s">[Bears]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15740.209s">[Bears]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15743.233s">[Bears]</a>: I'll go to Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15775.229s">[Bears]</a>: I think at this point, we've talked through the one I agree with you going forward on the rest of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15780.492s">[Bears]</a>: It does sound like maybe if someone wanted to make the motion to adopt all of the amendments from KPLL except for that amendment, and then we can do the rest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15789.436s">[Bears]</a>: I think it's working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15795.904s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15798.084s">[Bears]</a>: So, Councilor Collins, are you making a motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15816.571s">[Bears]</a>: Give Councilor Collins a floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15817.871s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15846.344s">[Bears]</a>: Jean, could you just say the section number for me again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15852.899s">[Bears]</a>: 50-103 subsection C. Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15860.225s">[Bears]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15860.585s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15860.805s">[Bears]</a>: We're going to go back to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15863.207s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15864.388s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15876.572s">[Bears]</a>: This is a welcoming city ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15882.575s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Merritt, I'm just going to give you your time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15974.811s">[Bears]</a>: We did pass that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16000.012s">[Bears]</a>: The city can employ people who are not residents of the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16006.098s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16014.81s">[Bears]</a>: I apologize for interrupting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16044.724s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16045.144s">[Bears]</a>: I will just note there are a lot of things that have been legal that have not been moral.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16050.576s">[Bears]</a>: in the history of this country and many other countries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16052.537s">[Bears]</a>: And I will also note that I have multiple people very important to me who are naturalized citizens of this country who are very afraid of being deported because the president has said he's going to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16062.101s">[Bears]</a>: Or the president-elect, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16063.441s">[Bears]</a>: Thank God for another four weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16064.882s">[Bears]</a>: So yeah, I'm grateful that your experiences, that the people in your life who have that identity are not afraid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16071.204s">[Bears]</a>: There are people very close to me who are citizens of this country, who were not born citizens of this country, who are deeply afraid that they will not be allowed to remain here because of the words and actions, promised actions of the person who's going to be taking the office of the president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16085.995s">[Bears]</a>: So, yeah, I like that Medford's not going to do his bidding because I want people I love to stay here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16093.601s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16094.662s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16095.302s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16096.003s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16096.883s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16275.371s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16277.731s">[Bears]</a>: I'm sure they'd love to use real documents if they could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16282.192s">[Bears]</a>: I'm sure that they would love to be using real documents if they were legally allowed to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16285.733s">[Bears]</a>: I'll go to Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16287.593s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16322.558s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16327.18s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks, and we will, but I'm going to say something first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16330.081s">[Bears]</a>: Um, something I've been sitting with up here for a couple hours that I've just want to voice<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16338.63s">[Bears]</a>: When we talk about dehumanizing rhetoric, when we talk about a dehumanizing politics that is infecting civil discourse at all levels, we experience that here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16348.995s">[Bears]</a>: I really don't mean to personalize this, but this ordinance is one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16353.457s">[Bears]</a>: We're talking about a surveillance ordinance in a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16355.698s">[Bears]</a>: I just want to say that a member of the community tonight wrote about me in a public forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16359.6s">[Bears]</a>: If Zach turned up dead, I would not mind it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16362.952s">[Bears]</a>: So that was written about me tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16365.596s">[Bears]</a>: And I'm just raising that point, it's not really exactly relevant to the core principles of this ordinance, but it is relevant to the idea of a welcoming city and about just horrifically dehumanizing rhetoric that is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16379.244s">[Bears]</a>: pervading civil discourse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16380.665s">[Bears]</a>: So when we talk about maybe not disrupting a public meeting and following the rules and listening to the rules of the chair and making sure that people feel safe to talk to their government officials, whether that's police or city councilors or anybody else, it is a local issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16398.836s">[Bears]</a>: And so I've stood here for two hours after having had to read that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16402.438s">[Bears]</a>: And I just felt like, quite frankly, people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16405.967s">[Bears]</a>: deserve to know that this isn't just about a police policy and putting it into law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16411.969s">[Bears]</a>: It's about some really harmful things that are happening in this community, some really harmful approaches and words and actions that are being brought to the forefront of a politics that I don't think any of us benefit from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16421.311s">[Bears]</a>: So when we talk about division, that's what's dividing us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16423.692s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16424.832s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion of Councilor Collins to adopt this ordinance for first reading as amended, seconded by Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16432.334s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16446.903s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, six in affirmative, one in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16448.344s">[Bears]</a>: The motion passes and the ordinance is moved for first reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16460.308s">[Bears]</a>: Offered by Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16461.909s">[Bears]</a>: Amendments to the Community Control of Republic Surveillance Ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16465.779s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16785.468s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16787.21s">[Bears]</a>: Would it be fair to say that to summarize these two amendments, the amendment to Section 5079 requires that any records kept by surveillance technologies that are not exempt, that are not required to be kept by the state or local law would not be kept?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16811.53s">[Bears]</a>: And then 5080, that this is amending essentially that it was unlawful for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16818.98s">[Bears]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16921.068s">[Bears]</a>: Is that in the first sentence?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16931.246s">[Bears]</a>: So could you send an amended version to the clerk, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16935.43s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16939.713s">[Bears]</a>: I think they're the same change in both sentences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16967.906s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16968.186s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion of Councilor Collins to approve for first reading, seconded by Councilor Tseng, we'll go to Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16974.291s">[Bears]</a>: As amended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17109.187s">[Bears]</a>: Sure, and I would just note that the CCOPS ordinance exempts CCTV cameras on public buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17115.189s">[Bears]</a>: It exempts the ability of our police department to receive data from private cameras, which is what most of the data was in the case that you mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17123.831s">[Bears]</a>: So it actually doesn't do any of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17125.911s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17128.292s">[Bears]</a>: You can't help it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17132.493s">[Bears]</a>: Truth matters, George.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17133.573s">[Bears]</a>: I'm sorry, George.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17134.953s">[Bears]</a>: But don't do what you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17136.074s">[Bears]</a>: It's just the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17138.43s">[Bears]</a>: George, please stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17139.793s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Collins has the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17140.896s">[Bears]</a>: It's embarrassing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17200.572s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you on the motion of Councilor Collins to adopt for first reading, seconded by Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17205.634s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion by members of the Council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17208.196s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, we'll go to public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17209.897s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17211.237s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17349.479s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17354.581s">[Bears]</a>: Go to the podium, name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17356.202s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17356.943s">[Bears]</a>: And if you'd like to speak in your own Zoom, please raise your hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17462.563s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I know, but you're not the only one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17526.391s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17527.212s">[Bears]</a>: Paulette, I hope I can allay some of your concerns just to say this does not ban surveillance cameras, does not ban the police from asking private businesses that have surveillance cameras to provide that information to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17538.719s">[Bears]</a>: It does not ban the city from having surveillance cameras for a number of purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17543.142s">[Bears]</a>: And this ordinance is an amendment to an ordinance that already exists and has existed for over a year and has not impacted criminal enforcement and cases in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17551.308s">[Bears]</a>: So I hope that allays some of the fears that you just raised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17554.79s">[Bears]</a>: for, you know, when information goes out there, sometimes it can be interpreted in different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17559.353s">[Bears]</a>: I just want to tell you all of these two paragraphs are amending is about the city being able to go and buy everybody's data from Amazon and then use that for some purpose other than, you know, I don't even know what purpose, but essentially going to a company and buying everything that the Internet knows about you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17576.406s">[Bears]</a>: and then using that to try to control your life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17579.148s">[Bears]</a>: That's what this is about tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17580.688s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17581.689s">[Bears]</a>: It's not about surveillance cameras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17583.17s">[Bears]</a>: If you read the existing surveillance ordinance that's in place, it exempts CCTV cameras that protect public property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17590.294s">[Bears]</a>: It doesn't mean that private businesses can't have their surveillance cameras like the hostile in the case recently that the mask down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17599.479s">[Bears]</a>: It doesn't do anything like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17600.659s">[Bears]</a>: So that's not what this does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17601.74s">[Bears]</a>: I don't want you to be afraid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17604.541s">[Bears]</a>: This ordinance is about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17605.822s">[Bears]</a>: the government and its access to information about its residents and not abusing residents by buying information in bulk to try to use that for some purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17617.112s">[Bears]</a>: Who knows what purpose they might use it for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17620.354s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17622.556s">[Bears]</a>: Stay at the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17623.657s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17624.778s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17674.118s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17675.493s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17676.533s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17720.719s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17721.36s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion by members of the public?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17724.382s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, is there any further discussion by members of the Council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17728.382s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion of Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Tseng to approve these amendments to the CCOPS ordinance for first reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17735.447s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17736.127s">[Bears]</a>: As amended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17736.548s">[Bears]</a>: As amended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17737.688s">[Bears]</a>: Please call the roll, Mr. Clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17755.865s">[Bears]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17757.026s">[Bears]</a>: Six in the affirmative, one in the negative, the motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17766.554s">[Bears]</a>: So that brings us, I believe, a reversion to the regular order of business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17770.037s">[Bears]</a>: There's two items left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17773.12s">[Bears]</a>: We have whatever is left of the regular order of business, I guess I could say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17778.785s">[Bears]</a>: We have mine, which I can't find right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17783.78s">[Bears]</a>: And I'm going to turn this over to Councilor Collins to read and control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17790.775s">[Bears]</a>: If you could leave your copy down there, you can use my copy up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17914.042s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Vice President Collins, for your presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17919.389s">[Bears]</a>: I think it really speaks to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17922.256s">[Bears]</a>: all of the issues, or at least some of the issues around 401 Boston Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17925.097s">[Bears]</a>: I do know we have a number of residents still on Zoom who wanted to speak to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17929.22s">[Bears]</a>: I just want to note that tomorrow night is the Community Development Board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17931.901s">[Bears]</a>: The Community Development Board is the authority that is reviewing this application.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17940.025s">[Bears]</a>: And I just wanted to also note a couple of things here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17942.006s">[Bears]</a>: To me,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17945.262s">[Bears]</a>: I am grateful that Tufts is taking on this responsibility to add housing on its campus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17950.785s">[Bears]</a>: That is something that this community has wanted Tufts to do for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17955.408s">[Bears]</a>: But every project that Tufts does falls under a greater scope of the balance of power between municipalities and large educational nonprofits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17964.653s">[Bears]</a>: That is way out of whack when it comes to our state laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17967.855s">[Bears]</a>: When it comes to our state laws around<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17971.697s">[Bears]</a>: site plan, Dover amendment, and what these institutions have to do to collaborate with municipalities and their neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17979.58s">[Bears]</a>: When it comes to the pilot legislation, payments in lieu of taxes and the, you know, five years ago we analyzed the Tufts on its non-taxable property would be paying $8 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17992.145s">[Bears]</a>: and it is paying $500,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17995.828s">[Bears]</a>: It's a huge loss for us when it comes to the city services that we need to provide, and the city services that institutions like that consume, both on campus and off campus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18005.676s">[Bears]</a>: So this really does fit into this larger question, which is why a big piece of this resolution is about the state legislation that this body has supported.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18014.663s">[Bears]</a>: both the home rule petitions around institutional master plans that we have submitted along with our neighbors in Somerville to ask Tufts and require Tufts to provide a master plan for their growth and development so that we can be aware of that and inform our community about that, as well as the pilot legislation to require a 25% pilot versus the completely voluntary system we have now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18037.105s">[Bears]</a>: One reason I bring up the institutional master plan is that around this Tufts proposal, you know, couple of years ago we had Tufts initially doing the storm proposal at around seven stories and 400 beds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18048.754s">[Bears]</a>: It's now 10 stories and 700 beds and I am actually a fan of more beds I think Tufts taking on more responsibility for on campus housing is a good thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18056.9s">[Bears]</a>: But I can understand how residents feel that the maybe the scope of the site plan and the height of the building and the shadows are a major issue, or even residents who just feel that the process itself, where it was seven stories now it's 10 stories, how do we get there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18073.635s">[Bears]</a>: And what what's the city's role in trying to mitigate and mediate and collaborate and negotiate in that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18081.331s">[Bears]</a>: City doesn't really seem to have much leverage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18083.854s">[Bears]</a>: So I really just respect the residents in the area who have advocated for changes to this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18091.042s">[Bears]</a>: I want to put ourselves on record as supporting those efforts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18095.827s">[Bears]</a>: I also did speak to the mayor earlier today about this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18100.672s">[Bears]</a>: She<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18101.813s">[Bears]</a>: and noted that she had sent a letter and that she supports our efforts and advocacy around this issue, but also that she has had some good conversations with Tufts and is hopeful for an outcome that has more mitigation, more community benefits than the initial Tufts proposal of three or four months ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18124.154s">[Bears]</a>: That process is ongoing in the Community Development Board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18126.155s">[Bears]</a>: I also spoke with Rocco DiRico from Tufts, and I do have want to just read an email that he sent over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18137.475s">[Bears]</a>: This is to the Honorable President, Zach Bears, Medford City Council regarding Resolution 24-513 to request changes to the proposed Tufts Dormitory project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18146.746s">[Bears]</a>: Dear President Bears, I ask that the following statement be read at tonight's City Council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18150.61s">[Bears]</a>: Tufts University is proposing a new residence hall to be operated by Capstone Management on Boston Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18155.896s">[Bears]</a>: The proposed project is part of an ongoing effort that meets many of the city's and the university's shared goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18160.882s">[Bears]</a>: More on campus housing, mixed use development, density near public transit, and an energy efficient building design that meets the city's specialized stretch energy code.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18168.79s">[Bears]</a>: The university has spent the last four months meeting with neighbors, government officials, the Community Development Board,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18173.255s">[Bears]</a>: and other stakeholders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18174.716s">[Bears]</a>: As a result of those meetings, we have added several community benefits to the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18178.057s">[Bears]</a>: Those improvements include new sidewalks on both sides of Boston Avenue, new crosswalks, new trees, new retail options, and a blue bike station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18185.319s">[Bears]</a>: All these improvements will make Boston Avenue greener, more walkable, and more accessible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18189.101s">[Bears]</a>: Tufts University has hosted three community meetings on this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18192.042s">[Bears]</a>: At these meetings, we listened to our neighbors, acknowledged their concerns, and acted upon feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18196.123s">[Bears]</a>: The university has also agreed to a $500,000 one-time payment to create a neighborhood improvement fund<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18201.025s">[Bears]</a>: for the neighborhood impacted by the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18203.207s">[Bears]</a>: We look forward to working with the neighbors and the city to determine the best way to utilize these funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18207.349s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you for the city's partnership with Tufts University on this project and many other initiatives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18211.372s">[Bears]</a>: The university remains committed to building more housing, revitalizing Boston Avenue, and improving accessibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18216.895s">[Bears]</a>: This project will have a positive impact on the city and the university.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18220.137s">[Bears]</a>: Sincerely, Rocco DiRico, Executive Director of Government and Community Relations, Tufts University.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18225.131s">[Bears]</a>: So I wanted to read that to note.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18227.552s">[Bears]</a>: That is the position of Tufts University.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18231.035s">[Bears]</a>: And Rocco and I have disagreed on many issues over the years, and we are able to have amicable discussions based on the positions that we both hold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18242.361s">[Bears]</a>: And I just say that because, again, commenting on civil discourse, I think, and what that means and how the truth plays a part in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18252.387s">[Bears]</a>: And I also just want to say I have some honest disagreements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18255.134s">[Bears]</a>: with Rocco, especially when it comes to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18260.45s">[Bears]</a>: what is the responsibility of these large educational nonprofit institutions to the municipalities, the cities, and the towns that they call home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18267.313s">[Bears]</a>: And I don't think state law reflects what the best arrangement of that should look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18270.814s">[Bears]</a>: And I think until we have changes there and until Tufts and cities like Benford are able to work together as partners to rebalance that relationship, it's going to poison processes, community processes around construction, around pilot, around expansion, around<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18286.64s">[Bears]</a>: what these institutions mean to the communities that they call home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18291.684s">[Bears]</a>: And I think that's what's happened here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18294.306s">[Bears]</a>: I think there's a lot of good that can come out of this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18298.289s">[Bears]</a>: I think there's some things that could change, and I would hope would change, and there's some things that maybe just can't change, and that's going to be really difficult to deal with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18309.421s">[Bears]</a>: I know that a lot of folks don't feel heard in the process, even, even with everything that Rocco said, people don't feel heard and people feel like Tufts just has so much power that it feels like a bully institution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18321.507s">[Bears]</a>: And that's really difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18322.928s">[Bears]</a>: And I don't think Tufts wants to be seen as that I don't think they want to act like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18326.73s">[Bears]</a>: And I think because, sadly, everyone in our society seems married to the idea that we just have to do whatever the law requires and nothing more, because the law is so imbalanced in Tufts' favor, they may not even realize how they're appearing and presenting to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18343.524s">[Bears]</a>: So I really hope we can see some systemic change here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18346.786s">[Bears]</a>: I think this project is sitting in that larger context.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18353.071s">[Bears]</a>: But I do hope that our Community Development Board can work<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18356.454s">[Bears]</a>: to get to a project approval that also reflects as much mitigation as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18363.202s">[Bears]</a>: And that in some ways, this resolution enhances the negotiating position of the city to secure additional community benefits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18370.089s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20255.188s">[Bears]</a>: You know, it's funny, the name bears derives from Pierce, and this picks it up as Pierce, which is so interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20262.173s">[Bears]</a>: We should talk about that for 15 minutes, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20267.297s">[Bears]</a>: All right, last item on the agenda, legally required referral.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20271.701s">[Bears]</a>: This is our proposed amendments to the Benford Zoning Ordinance, Salem Street Corridor District for referral to the Community Development Board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20288.584s">[Bears]</a>: Is there a motion to first we need a motion to waive the reading for a brief summary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20297.688s">[Bears]</a>: So moved on that motion by Councilor Collins seconded by Councilor let me Mr. Clerk please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20335.846s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20336.226s">[Bears]</a>: I have a negative motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20338.447s">[Bears]</a>: So this is the proposed Salem Street Corridor Zoning District.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20343.17s">[Bears]</a>: This is the product of several meetings of the Planning and Permitting Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20346.731s">[Bears]</a>: The memorandum contains the draft text for the following proposed zoning changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20350.785s">[Bears]</a>: to amend 94 dash 2.1 division into districts to amend 94 dash 3.2 table of use regulations and dimensional standards to end table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20361.101s">[Bears]</a>: of dimensional requirements to amend the definitions and to insert the section 94-9X Salem Street Corridor District.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20368.924s">[Bears]</a>: And so that is the summary of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20372.785s">[Bears]</a>: There's obviously much more detail here in this document of proposed zoning changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20378.347s">[Bears]</a>: But what I'm going to do for now is I'm just going to outline the process here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20382.288s">[Bears]</a>: So, um, two years ago, uh, the city released a comprehensive plan that comprehensive plan includes a number of recommendations around updates to the city zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20391.591s">[Bears]</a>: Uh, last year, the city council received funding and issued an RFP for proposals for zoning consultant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20399.753s">[Bears]</a>: We were able to choose the proposal of Innis associates, which is a group that has a lot of done a lot of great work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20406.455s">[Bears]</a>: They are, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20407.918s">[Bears]</a>: the proponent primary writers of the regulations for the MBTA Communities Act and also we're our consultant on the comprehensive plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20415.764s">[Bears]</a>: So they have intimate knowledge of the city's comprehensive plan and its zoning requirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20420.307s">[Bears]</a>: Since then, the planning and permitting committee has held 16 or 17 meetings this year with Innis Associates regarding a zoning updates project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20428.893s">[Bears]</a>: It's reported out a number of items including this, the Salem Street Corridor District.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20434.346s">[Bears]</a>: At this point, this is a vote to refer to the Community Development Board this initial proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20439.008s">[Bears]</a>: From this point forward, there will be two public hearings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20442.549s">[Bears]</a>: Community Development Board will open a public hearing, followed by the City Council opening a public hearing, which people can be heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20448.672s">[Bears]</a>: Community Development Board will review this and make recommendations to the City Council, and the City Council will then consider this, consider those recommendations, consider any other amendments, and then take a final vote on whether to amend the city's zoning ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20464.099s">[Bears]</a>: Similarly, earlier tonight if folks are paying attention or were attending this meeting earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20469.786s">[Bears]</a>: We approved the Mystic Avenue corridor district, which followed the same process, and this amendment and other amendments will also have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20478.129s">[Bears]</a>: several public meetings, generally at least two of the council before the public hearings, followed by at least two public hearings, and sometimes those public hearings occur over multiple meetings as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20489.239s">[Bears]</a>: So this proposal will go to the Community Development Board for a public hearing in the new year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20496.986s">[Bears]</a>: Recognizing Councilor Collins and then Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20538.298s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion of Councilor Collins to refer to the Community Development Board, seconded by Councilor Tseng, I will recognize Councilor Skarpuk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20610.151s">[Bears]</a>: Is that a B paper?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20612.372s">[Bears]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20612.632s">[Bears]</a>: That's a B paper from Councilor Scarpelli to hold a regular meeting or sorry, what meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20652.025s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, sorry, what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20655.012s">[Bears]</a>: i guess the public hearing of the council after the community development board that'd be great i will have to check to see if that's possible with the tv station and hybrid meetings any further comment on the resolution or the b paper i'll go to councillor callahan<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20687.734s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, this is just for referral to Community Development Board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20690.476s">[Bears]</a>: If we want to include as an amendment that there's a recommendation to strike A8.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20696.141s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20700.825s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20732.315s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, and I would just note that we're 2,500 feet from the Roberts School right now in this chamber.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20740.259s">[Bears]</a>: And I would just also note that the proposal that we accepted didn't include the number of meetings that we're talking about here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20749.743s">[Bears]</a>: So I'll see what we can do around the logistics of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20758.167s">[Bears]</a>: But Councilor Lazzaro?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20771.04s">[Bears]</a>: All right, guys, like, let's just close it up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20773.262s">[Bears]</a>: Literally the proposal that we accepted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20777.065s">[Bears]</a>: If I could, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20783.531s">[Bears]</a>: The proposal that we accepted regarding the zoning consultant<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20787.355s">[Bears]</a>: did not include the meetings that have been discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20790.017s">[Bears]</a>: Even though they were in the request for proposal, the proposal that this council, not even this council, the previous council voted to accept, it's just in the proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20799.885s">[Bears]</a>: You can't disagree with the document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20802.007s">[Bears]</a>: It's not possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20809.913s">[Bears]</a>: I went back and read the document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20813.056s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20814.257s">[Bears]</a>: What do you mean I didn't?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20816.587s">[Bears]</a>: What are you talking about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20819.489s">[Bears]</a>: Good Lord.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20821.55s">[Bears]</a>: Go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20824.492s">[Bears]</a>: It's just like, if there's no commitment to the truth, I have a duty as the chair to ensure that the members of this body have accurate factual information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20838.661s">[Bears]</a>: It's a fundamental duty of this role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20841.403s">[Bears]</a>: And I will not abrogate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20843.484s">[Bears]</a>: Public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20845.362s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20846.462s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20851.243s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20981.899s">[Bears]</a>: Please be an adult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=21067.674s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=21068.134s">[Bears]</a>: That's three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=21071.016s">[Bears]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=21088.491s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=21089.451s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=21090.372s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=21259.04s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=21259.501s">[Bears]</a>: Any further public comment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=21267.085s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, is there any further discussion on this referral to the Community Development Board?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=21271.088s">[Bears]</a>: We do have one more public comment on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=21273.07s">[Bears]</a>: I will go to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=21276.052s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Castagnetti, you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=21282.338s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=21298.868s">[Bears]</a>: Trying to unmute you, but we're only, there you go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=21301.37s">[Bears]</a>: All right, thank you, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=21304.773s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, we can hear you, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=21326.349s">[Bears]</a>: The donation was accepted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=21328.07s">[Bears]</a>: We did accept it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=21329.111s">[Bears]</a>: I'm not sure what the next steps are from the administration in terms of lights.<br><br>
