    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=0.009s">[Bears]</a>: Good news about the money too, so we'll get there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=3.03s">[Bears]</a>: Before I start, I want to shout out our Council Vice President, Kit Collins, who is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=7.19s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=12.011s">[Bears]</a>: Now, I know everyone's just here to see the giraffes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=15.532s">[Bears]</a>: We're going to do three things before then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=19.393s">[Bears]</a>: First, you're going to listen to me for a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=21.553s">[Bears]</a>: Hopefully you'll donate if you haven't already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=24.414s">[Bears]</a>: And then we're going to take a photo right around here so that we can show everyone how many people are psyched for this campaign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=32.287s">[Bears]</a>: correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=34.068s">[Bears]</a>: It's a beautiful evening to be here with all of you, my neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=37.83s">[Bears]</a>: I want to thank the McGordys for hosting us, and I want to thank everyone for everything that they've done so far to build the foundation of this grassroots campaign to invest in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=51.458s">[Bears]</a>: I want to talk a little bit about why we're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=54.52s">[Bears]</a>: We're here because we see the impact of chronic underfunding around all of us, all around us every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=60.868s">[Bears]</a>: Kids without the resources they need to thrive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=63.969s">[Bears]</a>: Schools in desperate need of maintenance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=66.429s">[Bears]</a>: Teachers and paras who aren't paid enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=69.11s">[Bears]</a>: Not enough teachers and paras and staff in the first place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=73.57s">[Bears]</a>: Streets and sidewalks in such bad shape that people are getting hurt and everyone's cars constantly need repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=80.352s">[Bears]</a>: A 60-year-old fire headquarters without the proper living quarters and gear storage to keep our firefighters safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=87.901s">[Bears]</a>: Not only do we see it, the numbers lay it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=91.162s">[Bears]</a>: We're the fifth lowest in per capita spending of the 97 cities and towns with more than 20,000 people in Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=99.285s">[Bears]</a>: 92nd out of 97.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=101.646s">[Bears]</a>: Fourth lowest residential property tax rate of that same group, 93rd out of 97.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=106.848s">[Bears]</a>: And we're one of only 20 cities out of all 351 cities and towns in Massachusetts that has never even tried to put an override or a debt exclusion on the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=117.092s">[Bears]</a>: Even the people who passed Proposition 2.5 in 1980 thought that these votes would be happening regularly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=123.498s">[Bears]</a>: It wasn't that we should starve government, it was just that people should know what their money's going towards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=128.904s">[Bears]</a>: And we have those items on the ballot today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=132.687s">[Bears]</a>: We're here because it's time to turn the ship around and invest in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=137.185s">[Bears]</a>: Medford residents have been clamoring for the chance to vote to invest in our city, and elected officials have finally delivered by putting questions six, seven, and eight on the ballot on Tuesday, November 5th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=149.51s">[Bears]</a>: We need to spend the next two months pounding the pavement, raising money, and talking to our neighbors about why we need to vote yes to invest in our schools, our streets, and our fire department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=160.214s">[Bears]</a>: Now, this campaign is not going to be easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=162.815s">[Bears]</a>: Some people may have seen the latest attack line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=165.697s">[Bears]</a>: Stop the scam.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=168.066s">[Bears]</a>: Well, let me tell you now, I think calling the hard work of people coming together to invest in our community a scam is just plain weird.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=177.708s">[Bears]</a>: Our kids are not a scam.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=180.009s">[Bears]</a>: Our teachers and our firefighters are not a scam.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=183.089s">[Bears]</a>: Walking or rolling or driving down the street safely is not a scam.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=187.17s">[Bears]</a>: Doing the right thing for our city is not a scam.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=189.891s">[Bears]</a>: So we're going to push back and we're going to push back hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=192.311s">[Bears]</a>: We'll be correcting the record and busting these myths every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=197.116s">[Bears]</a>: And we'll have resources to help you do it at investinmedford.com.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=200.397s">[Bears]</a>: There's stuff up there now, go check it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=202.338s">[Bears]</a>: There's gonna be even more rolling out over the next few weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=205.739s">[Bears]</a>: I need each and every one of you to be ambassadors for the truth here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=210.4s">[Bears]</a>: So sign up, most everyone did at the front, get trained on the facts and make sure you can step in and correct the record when the lies start coming out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=219.543s">[Bears]</a>: But pushing back just isn't enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=221.224s">[Bears]</a>: We need to fight back in order to win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=223.43s">[Bears]</a>: That means we need to get the facts out to as many people as possible, especially with so many people voting by sending mailers and spending enough money to do this campaign right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=232.097s">[Bears]</a>: Our fundraiser goal was $50,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=235.38s">[Bears]</a>: I want to thank everyone who's already given and raised over $6,000 just in the first two weeks of this campaign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=241.105s">[Bears]</a>: I especially want to thank Dave McKenna and Nicole Morrell, who gave $1,000 each.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=245.288s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=248.175s">[Bears]</a>: I wrote a check tonight for $1,000 from my campaign funds because winning this campaign and investing in our future is way more important than me getting reelected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=256.719s">[Bears]</a>: So I want to thank everyone who's already donated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=259.22s">[Bears]</a>: Please donate if you haven't and get the word out to your neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=262.662s">[Bears]</a>: I'm hoping we can raise another $6,000 tonight on our path to victory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=268.485s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you so much for letting me share my thoughts with you tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=271.786s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just so excited to talk to everybody, talk to our neighbors, and especially celebrate with some homegrown entertainment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=279.169s">[Bears]</a>: I love this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=279.989s">[Bears]</a>: We have a truly transformative opportunity to build a better future for Medford and I'm glad to be here with you over the next two months to make it happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=287.555s">[Bears]</a>: Last week I was reminded of some great words from a great campaign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=292.519s">[Bears]</a>: I'm fired up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=293.439s">[Bears]</a>: Are you fired up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=295.661s">[Bears]</a>: I'm ready to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=296.782s">[Bears]</a>: Are you ready to go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=297.662s">[Bears]</a>: Fired up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=300.765s">[Bears]</a>: Ready to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=302.526s">[Bears]</a>: Fired up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=304.287s">[Bears]</a>: Ready to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=305.928s">[Bears]</a>: Let's win this thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/18j4n2ij1pI&t=309.292s">[Bears]</a>: Alright, now we need to take that photo so folks could gather here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=22.537s">[Bears]</a>: Welcome, welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=23.539s">[Bears]</a>: We had over 60 people signed up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=25.643s">[Bears]</a>: There's about 30 of us here now, so really appreciate all the turnout.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=51.314s">[Bears]</a>: All right, it's 6.35.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=52.675s">[Bears]</a>: We want to be respectful of people's time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=55.837s">[Bears]</a>: Welcome to our Invest in Medford Zoom Community Forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=60.039s">[Bears]</a>: We will be here tonight until about eight o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=64.742s">[Bears]</a>: And I will be here with School Committee Vice Chair Jenny Graham and School Committee Secretary Paul Rousseau to talk about the Invest in Medford campaign and questions six, seven, and eight on the ballot here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=81.246s">[Bears]</a>: to invest in our schools, our streets, and a new fire headquarters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=85.968s">[Bears]</a>: The format we're gonna be using today is we are going to be starting off with about 10 to 15 minutes of introduction, short presentation from myself and Jenny and Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=98.053s">[Bears]</a>: Then we'll be taking questions for about an hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=102.595s">[Bears]</a>: There is an app up called Slido.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=104.896s">[Bears]</a>: If folks have a difficulty accessing it, let me know, but it should allow you to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=109.736s">[Bears]</a>: ask a question right in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=111.897s">[Bears]</a>: You should also be able to upvote questions that you like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=114.958s">[Bears]</a>: I obviously ask that folks, you know, use the tool responsibly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=120.401s">[Bears]</a>: You know, we had open registration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=121.741s">[Bears]</a>: This is a public meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=123.582s">[Bears]</a>: Looks like most everyone here is using their name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=126.404s">[Bears]</a>: But, you know, just want to do that digital security ask of everyone here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=131.706s">[Bears]</a>: And after that, we'll take about 10 to 15 minutes to wrap up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=135.688s">[Bears]</a>: If you feel<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=136.84s">[Bears]</a>: like a question didn't get asked, or if you wanna follow up with us after, you can send us an email at investinmedford.gmail.com and we will do our best to answer further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=150.29s">[Bears]</a>: And I'm sure all of, many of us are around to talk and answer questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=155.533s">[Bears]</a>: So with that, I will turn things over to Jenny to introduce herself and then Paul, and then we'll go from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=279.495s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Paul and Jenny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=282.645s">[Bears]</a>: So just, we've had a few more people come in, and as I noted before, we're gonna be taking questions right after our presentations and our introductions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=293.731s">[Bears]</a>: There's an app called Slido.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=295.592s">[Bears]</a>: I think I just sent an invitation to everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=298.174s">[Bears]</a>: You can ask questions using this app and upvote questions, and we will take them as they go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=305.798s">[Bears]</a>: If we see the same question multiple times, we're probably only gonna answer it once, but really encourage folks to start<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=312.708s">[Bears]</a>: putting forward their questions using the tool so that we can start to answer them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=319.652s">[Bears]</a>: So feel free to start doing that now, and hopefully we'll have a good lineup of questions to be answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=327.976s">[Bears]</a>: But before that, I just wanna talk a little bit more about how we got here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=332.758s">[Bears]</a>: So as Jenny noted, many of us in the city and many of us who run for office<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=342.486s">[Bears]</a>: have seen the impact of underfunding and austerity budgets and cost growing up faster than revenues going up and the impact that's had on our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=352.335s">[Bears]</a>: We see that our streets are not in the condition we want them to be in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=355.738s">[Bears]</a>: We know we have firefighters at the headquarters that is still appetited and far past the end of its useful life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=361.723s">[Bears]</a>: And of course, as Jenny and Paul have noted, we have a school system that really has faced a lot of challenges when it comes to budgets, hiring staff,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=370.29s">[Bears]</a>: maintaining programs, maintaining buildings, things that we see every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=376.371s">[Bears]</a>: And two years ago in 2022, we had the fiscal 23 budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=384.592s">[Bears]</a>: I'm sure if folks were paying attention at the time, they noted that it was a very contentious budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=392.194s">[Bears]</a>: And one of the things that came out of that was really a clear picture for the first time in a long time of the structural deficit in the city budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=399.91s">[Bears]</a>: the use of one-time funds to pay for ongoing expenses, the soon-to-be-expiring federal funds that even two years ago were on our radar as expiring that we were using to pay to keep our schools and our city moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=414.818s">[Bears]</a>: And where we are after that budget season, the city council, Councilor Collins and I tried to work with the mayor to see if we could get towards looking at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=428.191s">[Bears]</a>: an override to address that structural deficit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=430.933s">[Bears]</a>: We weren't able to reach an agreement, but the following budget season, after a lot of negotiation, we were able to work with the mayor to form, to reach an agreement, to pass a budget ordinance and to form a financial task force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=446.366s">[Bears]</a>: The school committee through its budget process and the council through this budget ordinance have really moved to a more transparent process that's more engaging of the public when we talk about creating the budget and understanding the challenges that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=458.935s">[Bears]</a>: And the piece I want to focus on just for a minute is the financial task force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=463.357s">[Bears]</a>: So the task force was announced in June of 2023, and consisting of the mayor, who is also the chair of the school committee, the council president, the council vice president, the school committee vice chair, and the chief of staff, also being supported by the staff in both our city departments<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=485.149s">[Bears]</a>: finance, et cetera, assessing, and our school finance and operations team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=490.834s">[Bears]</a>: So that task force was announced in June 2023.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=493.936s">[Bears]</a>: We started to meet, we put out an initial press release and public statement in September of 2023, talking about how we were going to continue to meet with the goal of coming back to folks before the end of the fiscal year with a proposal that addressed the major financial challenges facing the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=514.062s">[Bears]</a>: In March of 2023, sorry, 2024, we kind of put out, we announced a framework for that approach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=523.207s">[Bears]</a>: And then in June, we released the detail of that plan, which are the three ballot questions that are now on the ballot for November 5th for the consideration of the voters of the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=535.473s">[Bears]</a>: Those ballot questions are question six, what should be a debt exclusion to fund the construction of a new fire headquarters?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=542.596s">[Bears]</a>: Question seven,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=544.457s">[Bears]</a>: which addresses the school system structural deficit and also the fact that right now we don't have anyone in our DPW who is dedicated to fixing our streets and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=556.866s">[Bears]</a>: We would bring back a dedicated street and sidewalk repair crew for the first time in many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=561.749s">[Bears]</a>: And question eight is about the future of our schools and then really investing and expanding our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=566.152s">[Bears]</a>: So the $4 million override to invest<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=571.906s">[Bears]</a>: significantly into our schools, into our educators, into programming, into making our schools what we want to be, and addressing what Jenny and Paul noted, all of the things that people want to see our schools do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=584.271s">[Bears]</a>: Now, will we be able to do every single one of them with $4 million?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=587.072s">[Bears]</a>: No, but it's the first time we're going to be able to have a serious conversation about what transformational investment would look like in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=595.056s">[Bears]</a>: So the total of those items, the debt exclusion pays for a $30 million bond,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=601.394s">[Bears]</a>: The estimated cost of that is about $2 million per year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=604.915s">[Bears]</a>: That's question six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=606.155s">[Bears]</a>: Question seven is $3.5 million per year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=610.257s">[Bears]</a>: And question eight is $4 million per year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=613.538s">[Bears]</a>: Those amounts would be part of the property tax levy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=617.499s">[Bears]</a>: They would be paid by residents and businesses, and it would essentially affect the tax rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=623.981s">[Bears]</a>: The tax rate would be about 60 cents per, 60 cents higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=629.042s">[Bears]</a>: So it would go up from about 8.5<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=631.929s">[Bears]</a>: dollars per $1,000 in assessed value to about $9.1 per $1,000 in assessed value.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=639.212s">[Bears]</a>: And the average impact on the average single family home is about $37 per month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=644.635s">[Bears]</a>: So that is the summary of what we're talking about and how we got here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=650.697s">[Bears]</a>: And, you know, the financial task force really does believe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=655.276s">[Bears]</a>: that and has stated very clearly that this is a path forward that really does bring us to some financial stability and also the ability to make significant investments in our public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=667.98s">[Bears]</a>: So with that, I will end my comments and we can move into the question and answer period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=675.963s">[Bears]</a>: I see we do have a few questions here and I really do hope folks will submit some questions in the Q and A so that we can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=684.6s">[Bears]</a>: answer any concerns and provide information to the community about the questions they see around the override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=698.484s">[Bears]</a>: And I'm just putting out an invite once again for folks to submit their questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=703.225s">[Bears]</a>: The first question is, can you speak to cuts that will likely be made in our schools should the overrides not pass?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=708.747s">[Bears]</a>: That's from Melanie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=710.343s">[Bears]</a>: H and we have five likes on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=713.207s">[Bears]</a>: I will go to Paul or Jenny to talk about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1389.767s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I think just to follow up on that, the specifics of the cuts are part of the budget process, but the answer is 35 to 45 full-time equivalent positions, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1399.71s">[Bears]</a>: And that's...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1433.66s">[Bears]</a>: then I will clarify to at least 35 to 45 full-time equivalent positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1437.781s">[Bears]</a>: But what that looks like, I mean, that's, it's a huge cut, you know, that's, it's incredibly large.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1446.364s">[Bears]</a>: It's certainly would affect every building, every classroom, every program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1453.146s">[Bears]</a>: Jenny and Paul, I just wanted to follow up on, I just wanted to follow up on one thing, Jenny, first before we go to, there are some,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1461.84s">[Bears]</a>: Good questions here that we want to get to, but what was just there was 1 follow up to this question, which was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1467.342s">[Bears]</a>: What was actually cut this year and would anything be able to come back if the override did pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1650.342s">[Bears]</a>: I think that's a great transition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1651.763s">[Bears]</a>: And I think we might be able to meet both of your requests, Jenny, for a more hopeful question and talk about some of the things we could be able to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1660.411s">[Bears]</a>: The question was, could you provide some examples about funds from question eight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1664.974s">[Bears]</a>: So that is the investing more in our schools question, what those could be used to improve our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2169.997s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2170.957s">[Bears]</a>: I want to move to some of our other top questions here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2174.299s">[Bears]</a>: And folks, please feel free to submit some more questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2177.26s">[Bears]</a>: We have about 35, 40 minutes before we start to move into some wrapping up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2181.742s">[Bears]</a>: But the two top questions on deck right now, we'll start with one along these lines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2190.566s">[Bears]</a>: Is there a long-term plan to fill these budget gaps, or will we continue to need budget overrides?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2197.213s">[Bears]</a>: The answer is there is a long-term plan to increase revenue for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2201.874s">[Bears]</a>: The city council has been working on that in partnership with our planning department for several years now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2208.476s">[Bears]</a>: Two years ago, we passed the first recodification of the city zoning in 60 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2215.398s">[Bears]</a>: And what that does is if we allow new development and new growth, that is the only way outside of an override or a debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2223.7s">[Bears]</a>: that the property tax levy can increase above the 2.5%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2228.742s">[Bears]</a>: So the last two years have actually been the best two years for new growth values in the city of Medford in the last 25 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2236.804s">[Bears]</a>: No matter what other people may say about that, that's just the fact you can go to the State Department of Revenue Division of Local Services website to see that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2245.847s">[Bears]</a>: And that has helped in the past two years, it hasn't been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2251.807s">[Bears]</a>: astronomical Cambridge, Somerville, Boston level, or even Worcester level growth, but it has been an improvement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2260.288s">[Bears]</a>: It has staved off even more cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2263.649s">[Bears]</a>: It made possible this year some of what Jenny and Paul were talking about around not having to make the cuts that we had to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2272.751s">[Bears]</a>: And part of that is also the one-time revenue, the one-time funding from the federal government, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2279.432s">[Bears]</a>: But the city council,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2281.661s">[Bears]</a>: In partnership with the planning department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2283.742s">[Bears]</a>: We now have a city comprehensive plan for the first time ever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2287.684s">[Bears]</a>: We have a city housing production plan we also have our climate plan and our open space plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2293.627s">[Bears]</a>: And those are going, all of those are being looped into a zoning update project that the council has been working on with the planning department and our zoning consultant in associates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2307.559s">[Bears]</a>: 11 times on that year in city council in our planning and permitting committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2312.743s">[Bears]</a>: We have some really, we made some initial adjustments and we have some really, I think, transformative proposals coming up around our Mystic Avenue corridor, our Salem Street corridor, our Medford Square corridor, in terms of the transforming those neighborhoods and allowing significant new growth to see<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2335.123s">[Bears]</a>: modern walkable mixed use corridors with commercial space and residential space that once the zoning is completed and then once property owners and developers come in to start working on these projects would be transformative for our community in terms of raising revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2354.67s">[Bears]</a>: So that is the long-term vision for how we raise revenue beyond going down the other model.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2362.164s">[Bears]</a>: I think this is maybe going into the next question a little bit, but the other model is the Winchester, Weston, Arlington, and other place model, which if folks don't know, those are places that do overrides and debt exclusions all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2378.53s">[Bears]</a>: Something that may be a surprise to folks is that when Proposition 2 1⁄2 passed in 1980, the proponents of Proposition 2 1⁄2 actually said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2390.583s">[Bears]</a>: that they expected communities to do overrides and debt exclusions regularly, and that the reason for the law was just so that it would be transparent and decided on by the voters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2402.488s">[Bears]</a>: Now, many, 315, I think, of the 351 cities and towns in Massachusetts have since proposed an overrider or debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2412.612s">[Bears]</a>: Many of those communities have passed an overrider or debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2415.773s">[Bears]</a>: Medford is one of the few that has never even put one on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2420.501s">[Bears]</a>: So we think that with our location close to Boston, the value of our community, the transformative opportunities and corridors that have not seen the economic development focus that they've needed to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2433.652s">[Bears]</a>: And quite frankly, if we had seen 10, 20, 30 years ago, we might be having a different conversation today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2439.156s">[Bears]</a>: We might be having a conversation more like a Somerville or a Cambridge or even an Everett.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2444.501s">[Bears]</a>: That's a way for us to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2447.011s">[Bears]</a>: transform the community in a positive way, bring new amenities and benefits to the people who live here and increase the city's tax base significantly in the long run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2456.698s">[Bears]</a>: I think in the medium to short term, you know, the financial task force believes that these overrides and the debt exclusion for the fire station provide significant fiscal space in the next few years for the city to not be in a budget crunch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2473.03s">[Bears]</a>: and maybe even be a bridge entirely to that development and revenue from those new developments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2479.452s">[Bears]</a>: I can't say that with any certainty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2481.232s">[Bears]</a>: Certainly if there's another period, you know, if the tariff that have been proposed by a presidential candidate go into place and we see inflation at 10 or 20% again in the next couple of years, we're gonna be in really big trouble right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2494.876s">[Bears]</a>: If we see 2% inflation for the next 10 years, it's a different story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2499.397s">[Bears]</a>: But, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2502.645s">[Bears]</a>: That's really the thinking here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2504.506s">[Bears]</a>: The one project that I think would fall outside of that is, of course, the new Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2508.91s">[Bears]</a>: There is no way, and you haven't really seen any community, even Somerville with Assembly Row had to do a debt exclusion for its new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2517.276s">[Bears]</a>: That is the one project that I think there would be a further request of the voters to fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2522.901s">[Bears]</a>: But right now, that is the only thing on the horizon that the current leadership team between the mayor, council, and school committee foresees asking the voters to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2532.557s">[Bears]</a>: the conditions remain reasonable and we don't have 20% tariffs on everything we import.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2542.462s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know if Jenny or Paul you want to add on that long term court plan around the budget gaps at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2658.793s">[Bears]</a>: I think there's a follow-up on that, Jenny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2660.973s">[Bears]</a>: There's a question, why do we have to wait so long for the high school debt exclusion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2664.234s">[Bears]</a>: And I may have misspoke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2665.334s">[Bears]</a>: That would be sooner than 5 to 10 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2667.595s">[Bears]</a>: The MSBA process, the stage we're in now, we would probably find out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2671.336s">[Bears]</a>: Jenny, could you go into that a little bit more?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2752.161s">[Bears]</a>: For the new high school for the new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2753.922s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2754.863s">[Bears]</a>: All right, Paul, I cut you off and then I will go to Matt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2764.988s">[Bears]</a>: Another panel, Matt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2896.746s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just missing those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2897.686s">[Bears]</a>: That's really a really important point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2899.707s">[Bears]</a>: Sometimes I take for granted that people don't know that we don't have such basic things that I forget to mention that we're establishing things for the first time here in Medford that many communities have had for decades, if not longer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2914.238s">[Bears]</a>: Jack, could I speak to the admin is heavy question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2919.101s">[Bears]</a>: Sure, yeah, we'll jump back to that and then we can talk about a couple other questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3196.668s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3197.268s">[Bears]</a>: I want to go to the next question that we have a bunch of votes on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3201.829s">[Bears]</a>: which is, do we know what other towns have done to get overrides to pass given that Medford is a laggard compared to similar towns?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3209.574s">[Bears]</a>: I will defer to my colleagues in just a moment, but I wish there was a magic formula, because I'd be less stressed out about whether or not this question or these questions are going to pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3223.463s">[Bears]</a>: I think, to be honest, the first step is the city government needs to have the courage to ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3229.394s">[Bears]</a>: This is the first time the city government has had the courage to ask the voters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3233.876s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think anyone thinks, oh, let's raise our taxes is a popular thing for anyone to ask anyone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3241.64s">[Bears]</a>: And I understand like deeply and completely that it's a difficult decision for a lot of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3246.162s">[Bears]</a>: I think we all understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3248.583s">[Bears]</a>: I think we also know that there's a lot of difficult decisions that have been had to be made or continue to be making when it comes to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3257.961s">[Bears]</a>: layoffs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3258.682s">[Bears]</a>: And do we pay our staff enough?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3261.023s">[Bears]</a>: And do we have this department exist anymore?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3265.326s">[Bears]</a>: Things that are really fundamental to the functioning of city government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3269.049s">[Bears]</a>: And, you know, do we have our firefighters have a building where they feel like they're not going to get sick in that building, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3275.434s">[Bears]</a>: Like, these are really human deep questions, just as much as am I able to afford the tax increase is a really human deep question for a lot of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3283.98s">[Bears]</a>: And I think for a long time, city government<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3288.004s">[Bears]</a>: felt like we could keep asking the community to not invest in city government, to do more with less, and found creative or uncreative or short-term, not long-term ways to make that work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3304.816s">[Bears]</a>: And the last five years, especially with the pandemic and with the cost growth, we hit the wall, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3311.101s">[Bears]</a>: And so now we don't have another choice but to ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3314.443s">[Bears]</a>: And I think we've been clear that if we ask and we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3317.472s">[Bears]</a>: And the answer is no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3318.372s">[Bears]</a>: And there's a lot of very, very hard choices that come after that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3323.555s">[Bears]</a>: And so that's the first step I think to getting an override to pass is that an override is on the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3330.979s">[Bears]</a>: From what other towns have done what we need to do I think Matt really spoke to it and Paul spoke to it and Jenny spoke to it as well right like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3339.255s">[Bears]</a>: How do one of the big things that we're talking about the financial task force is how do we make sure that we address the scope of problems that is significant enough that people can see the investment that we're asking them to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3349.543s">[Bears]</a>: Because if we don't do a big enough thing and we ask people to do this and they don't actually see a change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3356.209s">[Bears]</a>: we're not engendering any more trust than we've been engendering with the lack of progress that the city has been making for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3363.4s">[Bears]</a>: Um, so I'm really encouraged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3365.64s">[Bears]</a>: I think we've done a lot of public education, quite frankly, over the last two to four years around the difficulties and issues that we see in our schools and on our streets and in our city departments, where a lot of people are saying, Hey, you know, maybe I don't want to pay more taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3383.283s">[Bears]</a>: Maybe it will be a challenge for me to figure out how to afford to pay more taxes, but also I care about this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3390.205s">[Bears]</a>: And I know that we need to do these things because.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3393.394s">[Bears]</a>: And we can just see it, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3395.576s">[Bears]</a>: Like it's literally the environment that we live in and the buildings that our kids are in and the teachers who are overworked and the city employees who are overworked, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3406.405s">[Bears]</a>: Like we see and feel the reality and I think people are ready to make this investment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3411.288s">[Bears]</a>: So I've been really encouraged talking to my neighbors, been really encouraged talking to lots of folks across the city that these things are going to pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3421.348s">[Bears]</a>: And I think the good thing that if we move forward on these is it sets a foundation for us to show progress, to show improvement, to maybe get the financial systems and softwares in place where we can point to a dashboard instead of a spreadsheet, point to, you know, pull data in a day instead of a week to answer questions more quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3445.364s">[Bears]</a>: And my hope is to see that virtuous cycle of investment beginning more investment and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3450.799s">[Bears]</a>: city government having the resources that it needs to do its job, meaning that the public trust the city can do its job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3457.743s">[Bears]</a>: So that is my real hope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3461.344s">[Bears]</a>: I feel good right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3463.285s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to be working very hard over the next 27 days, talking to people, getting people, raising money to send out the mailers, doing all the different things that we need to do to make sure that we get a yes vote on November 5th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3477.653s">[Bears]</a>: But that's my kind of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3480.609s">[Bears]</a>: pitch and spiel around what do we need to do to get an override to pass and why we went this direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3487.034s">[Bears]</a>: Paul, I see that you're next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3734.926s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know if anyone can tell that Paul is the secretary of the school committee, because one of the jobs that Paul has to do is sign every bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3741.79s">[Bears]</a>: So he's pretty familiar with that side of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3746.133s">[Bears]</a>: I think Jenny raised the same exact point, though, around our class sizes, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3754.298s">[Bears]</a>: When you ask teachers and paras to have more kids in the room, it gets harder to educate the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3763.203s">[Bears]</a>: And if you can have four less kids in a room, that may be the difference between someone staying or someone going somewhere else where the class sizes are smaller.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3773.309s">[Bears]</a>: To be honest, there's burnout and turnover in the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3776.29s">[Bears]</a>: Sure, I'm on the city council and I spend a lot more time on the city side of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3781.544s">[Bears]</a>: We have a lot of turnover and burnout on the city side too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3784.065s">[Bears]</a>: A lot of great folks come in, build some relationships.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3788.247s">[Bears]</a>: They're here for a year, they're here for two years, and then they get offered a job that isn't as many hours, is at a higher pay rate in another city or in the private sector, and they move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3798.872s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, I think the greatest example of this is our issue hiring a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3805.554s">[Bears]</a>: We've raised the pay like two or three times now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3809.454s">[Bears]</a>: hoping that this latest one, which was just a month ago, might actually, or two months ago, might actually lock us in and hopefully we can hire someone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3817.539s">[Bears]</a>: But yeah, people come in, they work hard, they realize that they don't have the, they're working more or doing more jobs that they would have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3827.566s">[Bears]</a>: And then, you know, doing two jobs here where they might be able to do one job in another community, they move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3833.09s">[Bears]</a>: And I think we see that across the board, city and schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3835.511s">[Bears]</a>: I wanna go to the next question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3839.824s">[Bears]</a>: We'll just want to add in quickly that there was a clarification on the heavy administrator talking about the curriculum and department heads, not more superintendents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3847.83s">[Bears]</a>: So just wanted to note that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3849.591s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks for putting that clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3853.935s">[Bears]</a>: On the questions here that are left and we're coming up, you know, we got to probably about 10 or so minutes left if folks want to throw another question into the chat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3864.431s">[Bears]</a>: The next one is, has there been discussions about an owner-occupied property tax exemption like Cambridge and Somerville have, and is that something the city council could pass?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3873.375s">[Bears]</a>: So every year we use, we set the tax rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3879.117s">[Bears]</a>: I won't go into the, take me more than 10 minutes to go into the complexities of exactly how Proposition 2 1⁄2 works, but we set the tax rate every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3887.561s">[Bears]</a>: And one of the options that is, you know, we technically vote to consider is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3893.052s">[Bears]</a>: could we do an owner-occupied property tax exemption?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3896.534s">[Bears]</a>: What that means is that the city would set a certain percentage of the average residential bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3905.058s">[Bears]</a>: And if you were an owner-occupied unit, you would get that, essentially, your tax bill would go down by that amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3913.301s">[Bears]</a>: Let's use some round numbers here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3914.702s">[Bears]</a>: Let's say it's $3,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3917.406s">[Bears]</a>: that would be like a 30% exemption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3919.928s">[Bears]</a>: Let's say it's $3,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3920.868s">[Bears]</a>: Now, I don't know off the top of my head, it's actually probably pretty close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3925.871s">[Bears]</a>: How that would work is everybody who pays a residential tax bill from, if your owner occupied, regardless of your value, you'd get $3,000 off your bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3940.5s">[Bears]</a>: So if your house, essentially it creates a breakeven point where,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3947.199s">[Bears]</a>: And it's a little more complicated than this, but basically everyone who's owner-occupied would get that cut off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3953.541s">[Bears]</a>: But that money doesn't just go away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3955.161s">[Bears]</a>: The city can't afford to actually have the taxes go down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3958.022s">[Bears]</a>: So that amount that owner-occupants get, that reduction, gets shifted onto people who don't get the owner-occupant exemption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3964.984s">[Bears]</a>: So essentially, you'd be shifting the city, the cost of the property tax on residential properties,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3972.589s">[Bears]</a>: off of owner-occupants onto non-owner-occupants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3975.83s">[Bears]</a>: But the other side of that is that that actually changes the tax rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3979.351s">[Bears]</a>: It essentially means instead of a flat residential tax rate on residential tax bills, you end up with a progressive rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3987.815s">[Bears]</a>: I don't actually think that's a bad thing, but one of the reasons that previous councils prior to 2022<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3997.83s">[Bears]</a>: didn't pass it is it actually would raise taxes on owner occupants in high value homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4003.775s">[Bears]</a>: So if your home is worth more than the breakeven point, even though you get the exemption, the tax rates going up more than the exemptions, you actually pay more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4012.583s">[Bears]</a>: The point being that it's a complicated conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4016.206s">[Bears]</a>: Essentially, if you are in a condo or a small single family and you're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4021.954s">[Bears]</a>: living in that, you're an owner occupant, your taxes will probably go down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4025.435s">[Bears]</a>: If you're in an expensive single family or a multifamily, your taxes are probably going up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4030.657s">[Bears]</a>: If you're a certainly large apartment buildings, those there'd be significant increase because the rate would go up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4036.599s">[Bears]</a>: So it's not just this, you know, everyone who gets an if we implemented it tomorrow, that everyone would get this benefit in the same way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4043.441s">[Bears]</a>: It's a complicated conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4046.164s">[Bears]</a>: One of the reasons we haven't implemented it is because both the previous city assessor and the current city assessor say it would take them about a year to do the calculations and get everything in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4056.556s">[Bears]</a>: And they'd probably need one to two more staff people in the assessing office just to process the applications for the owner occupancy exemption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4065.606s">[Bears]</a>: So it's a significant undertaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4068.5s">[Bears]</a>: A lot of places like Everett's and Somerville's and Cambridge's did this a long time ago when the conversation was a little bit different because of the property values that we see today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4080.931s">[Bears]</a>: But yeah, so we've talked about it a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4082.312s">[Bears]</a>: I think I actually know too much about it because I don't know that I explained it particularly well right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4087.417s">[Bears]</a>: But we've talked about it every year that we've set the tax rate since I've been on the council and I know on prior councils before that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4094.125s">[Bears]</a>: It would be a complicated undertaking, and it isn't the silver bullet that it's presented to be a lot of the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4101.047s">[Bears]</a>: But do I think it's a bad idea?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4102.627s">[Bears]</a>: No, and I'd be willing to move forward on it if folks felt we could make the time and effort and make it a priority personally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4112.87s">[Bears]</a>: Next question is on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4116.838s">[Bears]</a>: The when would we expect to see changes to the high school vocational schedule, if we were able to move forward and if the negotiations were able to be concluded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4353.626s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4354.827s">[Bears]</a>: And I think, yeah, I think everybody who's everyone I've talked to talks about it gets that it's a heavy lift, but also that getting prepared to make that lift everyone's on that page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4365.17s">[Bears]</a>: All right, we got two more questions left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4367.19s">[Bears]</a>: We're about on time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4369.875s">[Bears]</a>: Well, two and a half, there's a dueling questions for anyone who's seen it at the end and we'll take that one last, but just Rebecca's question is money from the override only required to go to the directed budget for the first year and after that could go anywhere else in the city budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4384.946s">[Bears]</a>: There's two answers to this question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4388.649s">[Bears]</a>: Proposition two and a half date law requires that in the first year, it goes towards the specific purposes outlined in the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4396.735s">[Bears]</a>: Those appropriations would be made<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4399.329s">[Bears]</a>: people would be hired, things would be purchased, contracts would be signed based on those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4407.856s">[Bears]</a>: In the second year, could the mayor and the school committee and the council then fire everybody that they just hired and go completely in another direction?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4416.482s">[Bears]</a>: And I mean, is it legally allowed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4421.866s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, is it something that would be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4424.577s">[Bears]</a>: in the realm of possibility?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4426.098s">[Bears]</a>: Absolutely not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4427.358s">[Bears]</a>: I think we've all been very, very clear that what the purpose of these overrides are for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4432.58s">[Bears]</a>: And I don't think anyone here, I think we've already been very clear that we don't like the fact that there are layoffs and position cuts and things happening now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4442.164s">[Bears]</a>: I certainly don't think that some massive bait and switch, I don't even know what we would put it into, to be honest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4450.227s">[Bears]</a>: These are the things that we want to do with the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4452.288s">[Bears]</a>: These are the things that we think are the priority of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4455.37s">[Bears]</a>: And yeah, there's a little bit of trust that comes from that, and I acknowledge that, but we've been very clear about what these priorities are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4466.259s">[Bears]</a>: And a lot of it, especially on the school side, is also subject to negotiation, collective bargaining agreements, other laws, and that's what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4478.93s">[Bears]</a>: We've been very clear that if these overrides are to pass,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4482.68s">[Bears]</a>: they would fund our schools, they would fund our educators, they would fund the people who work in our schools, they would hire a DPW street crew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4490.705s">[Bears]</a>: And what I can say is that if the debt exclusion passes question six, that just have to go to the fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4495.908s">[Bears]</a>: That's the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4497.088s">[Bears]</a>: They can only pay for the bond for the fire station, period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4500.73s">[Bears]</a>: So that's the answer to that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4504.132s">[Bears]</a>: And can I just add to that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4658.241s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks, Jenny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4660.083s">[Bears]</a>: I want to move to wrap up on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4664.764s">[Bears]</a>: The last couple of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4666.444s">[Bears]</a>: So we have dueling questions that I think probably none of us here on the panel are the people who should be answering these questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4671.746s">[Bears]</a>: So I would ask us not to answer them, but I will read them since they have been asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4675.747s">[Bears]</a>: They are, how could the CC and SC accept a pay raise when you say we're in dire need of money and then ask for an override?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4684.089s">[Bears]</a>: And that has been also countered with the question, how can we increase CC and SC pay to increase diversity on those bodies so they represent the city's diverse population?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4693.012s">[Bears]</a>: Those are both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4695.701s">[Bears]</a>: viewpoints that people hold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4698.783s">[Bears]</a>: We have a final question here, which is what is the impact of union student leadership, either having had posed or unsure yet on the overhead set exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4709.788s">[Bears]</a>: So that's that the fire union is not supportive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4712.87s">[Bears]</a>: And the teachers union has not yet made a decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4717.252s">[Bears]</a>: I don't I don't know what the impact of it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4721.114s">[Bears]</a>: Certainly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4722.409s">[Bears]</a>: I would hope that in the case of the fire union, that they could put aside some of their differences with the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4729.995s">[Bears]</a>: And I think the funding of this project and that we are prioritizing funding a new fire station should be considered independently of the disputes that the mayor and the fire union have had over fire station design and other matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4745.547s">[Bears]</a>: That's my personal opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4748.263s">[Bears]</a>: And I know I've spoken to a lot of our educators about these questions and some support, some oppose, and I'll leave it up to the Medford Teachers Association and other educator unions here in the city to make the decision that they need to make in the time that they need to make it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4766.757s">[Bears]</a>: With that, I wanted to wrap up quickly unless, Paul, Jenny, you have anything else you wanna add before I just put out a few pitches to the folks who are still here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4826.24s">[Bears]</a>: There are also, thanks, Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4828.582s">[Bears]</a>: To that point, there's also two more opportunities coming up for folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4832.284s">[Bears]</a>: If you thought of a question as we're wrapping up, or you think of one after you leave here tonight,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4837.55s">[Bears]</a>: Next Tuesday at 6pm we have a city council committee of the whole meeting in the city council chamber, where we will be talking kind of doing a similar q amp a style format, you'll hear from members of the council and basically answering the questions they feel like they can answer asked by the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4854.461s">[Bears]</a>: Then we also have an in-person version of this event, an Invest in Medford community forum, Monday, October 21st at 7pm, and that's going to be at the library.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4864.226s">[Bears]</a>: So those are two more opportunities that we have for very similar events.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4870.689s">[Bears]</a>: As Paul noted, you can reach out to us, investinmedford.gmail.com, or reach out to your elected officials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4878.093s">[Bears]</a>: Our contact information is online as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4881.375s">[Bears]</a>: Jenny, if you want to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4883.089s">[Bears]</a>: say anything, and then I'm just going to put a couple of resources in the chat really quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4966.4s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks so much, Jenny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4968.241s">[Bears]</a>: On that note, just want to share again, this was an Invest in Medford community forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5020.695s">[Bears]</a>: We still have a few left,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5021.897s">[Bears]</a>: Not many.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5023.978s">[Bears]</a>: And you can sign up to Canvas and talk to your neighbors about these important issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5029.541s">[Bears]</a>: There's also some endorsements up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5032.102s">[Bears]</a>: We do have endorsements from 11 of the 14 city elected officials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5036.384s">[Bears]</a>: We have endorsements from three of our four state elected officials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5040.325s">[Bears]</a>: We have a few organizations up here hoping to add some more soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5045.588s">[Bears]</a>: And this great FAQ page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5048.396s">[Bears]</a>: which really gets into some of the details on what would be the impact if the overrides don't pass?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5055.64s">[Bears]</a>: Why do we need the overrides?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5057.461s">[Bears]</a>: What are overrides and debt exclusions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5060.502s">[Bears]</a>: How will they impact your taxes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5063.064s">[Bears]</a>: And then just some of the information about how to measure taxes compared to other cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5069.627s">[Bears]</a>: You know, one thing that I think is just really important to note, our residential tax rate is the 93rd lowest out of the 97<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5077.486s">[Bears]</a>: MA cities and towns with population over 20,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5082.33s">[Bears]</a>: And there's just a lot more here on the website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5084.272s">[Bears]</a>: So if you are looking for more information, looking to share, looking to join our campaign, you can go to investinmedford.com.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5092.838s">[Bears]</a>: And we really hope that folks here will strongly consider and commit to vote yes on questions six, seven, and eight on Tuesday, November 5th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5102.166s">[Bears]</a>: Mail voting has already started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5104.007s">[Bears]</a>: Early voting starts Saturday, October 19th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5106.983s">[Bears]</a>: And election day, if you're voting at your polling location, if you haven't made your choice by Tuesday, November 5th, polling locations will be open 7 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5115.106s">[Bears]</a>: to 8 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5116.446s">[Bears]</a>: on November 5th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5117.566s">[Bears]</a>: So we really, really hope that everyone here will vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5121.307s">[Bears]</a>: And I think it's fair to say that this panel hopes that folks will vote yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5127.509s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks everybody for a wonderful evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5129.53s">[Bears]</a>: Really appreciate everyone being here and hope to see you over the next few weeks as we lead up to election day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=600.702s">[Bears]</a>: Uh, councilor present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=602.964s">[Bears]</a>: Do we know if the charter study committee's recommendations use these?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=607.909s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=608.31s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=608.57s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=776.874s">[Bears]</a>: when everyone else is ready to go to the next slide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=809.685s">[Bears]</a>: I'm good, I have some thoughts, but I can defer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=913.625s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I think just to get a little bit more explicit on that, we'll see what their proposals and ideas are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=920.67s">[Bears]</a>: I would think, it seems to me that there's three and maybe a fourth logical division of this for us, given that I think we're gonna make some changes to the ideas and proposals of the Charter Study Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=934.767s">[Bears]</a>: So I could kind of see it going and there could be an added step potentially, but my thinking is that the, and I don't even know if we need its own meeting for this necessarily, but the legislative and executive branch question would be one piece of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=955.6s">[Bears]</a>: The administrative organization, financial procedures organization would be another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=962.124s">[Bears]</a>: And then the citizen participation and elections piece could be the third.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=968.448s">[Bears]</a>: And I think then maybe the incorporation, general provisions, transitional provisions would be another bucket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=981.576s">[Bears]</a>: along with school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=983.218s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just wondering if we want to have our own meeting for school committee and invite the school committee members to input, have their input on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=990.665s">[Bears]</a>: And maybe that could be, maybe it's three meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=992.987s">[Bears]</a>: Maybe it's like legislative executive administration or four meetings, legislative executive administration, financial elections, and citizen participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1001.816s">[Bears]</a>: And maybe we could also do the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1004.713s">[Bears]</a>: incorporate the, you know, incorporation and the general provisions as part of that I think that might be, I'm just trying to think of like the scope of work, you know, those seem to be a little bit quicker to get through like I'm sure we'll just kind of take what the Charter Study Committee said for section one is like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1022.773s">[Bears]</a>: you know, we are the city of Medford and this is our mission statement, that kind of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1026.796s">[Bears]</a>: It's not as nitty gritty as the details of like, what are the districts maybe going to be for different bodies?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1034.202s">[Bears]</a>: Or do we want that to be uniform?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1037.724s">[Bears]</a>: You know, powers, of course, are a huge question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1040.987s">[Bears]</a>: Do we want to go down the road of certain things around elections?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1044.81s">[Bears]</a>: We already have elections every two years, stuff like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1048.273s">[Bears]</a>: So I think those are,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1051.428s">[Bears]</a>: kind of the bigger buckets of work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1054.514s">[Bears]</a>: So maybe there's five buckets of work, but maybe it's four meetings, maybe we could do a couple in one meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1061.894s">[Bears]</a>: And the one that just sticks out to me is what we might want to schedule separately as a school committee, just so that I just don't think we should lump that in with legislative executive branch I think it's a little bit different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1074.023s">[Bears]</a>: And then I think if we're having those four meetings of this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1077.666s">[Bears]</a>: My other question would be, do we want to have a meeting before those four meetings where we.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1084.551s">[Bears]</a>: receive the mayor's thoughts and the study committee's thoughts before we go into specifically those four meetings on the actual topics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1095.002s">[Bears]</a>: And that might give counselors, you know, time to review that report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1100.168s">[Bears]</a>: If we want to send any questions back to the mayor or to KP or Tina to legal counsel or to the study committee, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1107.867s">[Bears]</a>: we could do that and then we could go step by step and say like, here are the four meetings and counselors could bring their proposals to those four meetings on the different kind of areas of the charter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1118.413s">[Bears]</a>: And that would probably be maybe that first meeting where we just start reviewing and asking questions about the study committee proposals and recommendations and the mayor's report, you know, recommendations and proposals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1130.68s">[Bears]</a>: Maybe that's next month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1132.081s">[Bears]</a>: And then maybe we could do, try to do one or two meetings a month over the next<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1136.957s">[Bears]</a>: you know, December, January, February, and then hopefully we're getting something out by March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1142.998s">[Bears]</a>: Um, and maybe we could even be putting that on the ballot for November, 2025, um, to go into effect in 2027, something like that would just be my thinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1155.881s">[Bears]</a>: Um, instead of having, I think if we go longer than that, we're probably waiting until 2026 or 2027 and not having anything going to effect for another five years, which I think we all want to avoid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1274.377s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, and to Councilor Collins, Vice President Collins' point, maybe that's the approach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1277.88s">[Bears]</a>: Maybe that meeting in a month from now or so is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1282.426s">[Bears]</a>: if we took down the four or five buckets that I kind of outlined, have counselors bring their ideas, what they've seen, what they think works for Medford, bring that to the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1294.217s">[Bears]</a>: We could then also have Collins Center or study committee or an example from another community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1299.481s">[Bears]</a>: And that would be a way for us to have that discussion without it being inherently like, I think what we want to avoid here is, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1311.274s">[Bears]</a>: Pitting different groups that have been moving through this against one another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1315.876s">[Bears]</a>: And like the ideas, I think like there's just going to be different ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1318.258s">[Bears]</a>: And now that this process that we are starting our process, which is the formal process and, you know, it can't move forward without a vote of the council can't move forward without the mayor being able to say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1330.68s">[Bears]</a>: All right, councilors think this, council maybe has been able to reach some consensus here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1335.963s">[Bears]</a>: How does that compare to what the mayor's thinking is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1338.324s">[Bears]</a>: How does that compare to what the charter study committee's ideas are?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1341.126s">[Bears]</a>: How does that compare to what some other communities do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1343.547s">[Bears]</a>: That would be a good way for us to factor in those different perspectives in a way that is productive and based on like a discussion format rather than it being like competing proposals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1453.645s">[Bears]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1454.085s">[Bears]</a>: I would move to have the chair through the clerk, send that out to members of the committee for members of the committee to come back with their ideas and comments on each of the different articles and sections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1466.134s">[Bears]</a>: And maybe when you send that out chair, you could lump them into those different groupings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1472.378s">[Bears]</a>: Each of it's basically I think two or three articles, a group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1476.198s">[Bears]</a>: And then when we come back in a month, hopefully we'll have a good discussion on that substance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1481.72s">[Bears]</a>: And then, so I'd move to do that and move to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1484.522s">[Bears]</a>: All one motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1486.963s">[Bears]</a>: Oh, Councilor Lozano.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1527.013s">[Bears]</a>: What you said will give us a picture of their ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=112.711s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=125.715s">[Bears]</a>: President Beyers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=128.696s">[Bears]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=129.656s">[Bears]</a>: 24475 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=132.691s">[Bears]</a>: be it resolved that the Medford City Council hold a question and answer session to discuss the definitions and terminology regarding the proposed Proposition 2.5 overrides and the proposed debt exclusion measure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=143.871s">[Bears]</a>: To that resolution, the following amendments were added.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=145.993s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli asked that the administration and Council on Aging do outreach to seniors about this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=151.277s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan requested outreach to parents of school-aged children, not just teachers, and specifically requested outreach to the PTOs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=157.722s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Sang requested general outreach and specifically requested that the community liaisons translate into other languages the information that is on the city website about the overrides and the debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=167.469s">[Bears]</a>: To ensure that the council is able to answer questions in a timely manner and that decorum is maintained, the council president, myself, will be enforcing the following rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=175.016s">[Bears]</a>: One, members of the public will have one minute to ask one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=178.58s">[Bears]</a>: Members of the public will not be able to ask a second question until all who seek to ask a question have had the chance to ask their first question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=185.286s">[Bears]</a>: The president will verbally request that residents not ask duplicative or largely similar questions to questions that have already been answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=191.621s">[Bears]</a>: and may move to the next question if a duplicative or similar question is asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=195.763s">[Bears]</a>: Each counselor will have up to two minutes to answer per question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=199.045s">[Bears]</a>: The president will verbally request the counselors not answer if a duplicative or largely similar answer has been given by another counselor and may move to the next question if a duplicative or similar answer is given.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=209.851s">[Bears]</a>: After members of the public have had the chance to ask their first question, the president will open the floor to either a second question or a short public comment by members of the public in attendance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=218.615s">[Bears]</a>: And before we start, I just want to say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=221.0s">[Bears]</a>: that the council itself is in mourning today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=224.602s">[Bears]</a>: Last night, we lost our city messenger, Larry Lepore, who has served us for many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=229.844s">[Bears]</a>: We will be having some condolence remarks made at our regular meeting that will begin after our committee of the whole meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=237.108s">[Bears]</a>: So I hope that folks will stick around if you knew Larry or otherwise to say a kind word or story that you may have shared with him during his many years serving the city behind this rail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=248.018s">[Bears]</a>: With that, I do want to invite our city assessor, Ted Costigan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=251.439s">[Bears]</a>: The council had requested some answers and updates from him, and I know that he's here to share some information that his office has been working on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=259.182s">[Bears]</a>: So with that, I will go to our assessor, Ted Costigan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=269.406s">[Bears]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=269.847s">[Bears]</a>: And then we'll go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=394.933s">[Bears]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=395.233s">[Bears]</a>: And per council, you mean legal council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=397.114s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know that I was on that email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=399.614s">[Bears]</a>: Was I on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=400.374s">[Bears]</a>: I believe it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=417.092s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=417.913s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=418.213s">[Bears]</a>: She means legal counsel, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=419.574s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=420.174s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=420.814s">[Bears]</a>: Good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=421.194s">[Bears]</a>: I didn't want her to think about this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=424.056s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=425.857s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=426.657s">[Bears]</a>: Um, with that, I'll go to our city assessor and let me know when you want me to put slides up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=443.479s">[Bears]</a>: The new mics are coming on Thursday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=450.024s">[Bears]</a>: Shane's going to come out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=451.365s">[Bears]</a>: He's going to fix it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=452.005s">[Bears]</a>: I hear the chair moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=454.947s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks, Shane.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=487.453s">[Bears]</a>: There we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=488.353s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, shane.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=834.517s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, sure, and just thanks, Ted, I wanna appreciate your hard work getting this done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=839.361s">[Bears]</a>: In October, it usually gets done in January, so it's appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=842.223s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarbelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=954.303s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1040.627s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks Ted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1041.247s">[Bears]</a>: Just two more questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1042.888s">[Bears]</a>: One, given your estimates, if neither of the overrides pass based on your estimates, the tax rate would once again be going down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1051.553s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1052.314s">[Bears]</a>: And before today, when you had the approved fiscal 25 values, would it have been possible for anyone to provide an update using anything other than the fiscal 24 values or an estimate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1063.985s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone from the public, not from your office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1076.007s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1077.308s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1077.729s">[Bears]</a>: Any further questions from members of council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1079.15s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1134.332s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1307.286s">[Bears]</a>: So we're going to say that happens every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1362.581s">[Bears]</a>: Generally, the CPA was included in the calculations presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1470.643s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks, Ted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1471.663s">[Bears]</a>: Really appreciate the hard work of your office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1473.904s">[Bears]</a>: Just want to note, certainly this council, and you've shared some recently, has taken several votes to maximize the exemptions allowed by state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1482.249s">[Bears]</a>: If you see anything more that we could do on that front, I believe in 2022, we voted to tie it to the law so that we wouldn't have to constantly be updating it as the state did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1491.852s">[Bears]</a>: If you see anything, please let us know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1493.994s">[Bears]</a>: Certainly our intent is to be maximizing everything, and I believe we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1509.407s">[Bears]</a>: Awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1509.847s">[Bears]</a>: We will do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1510.648s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1511.048s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1512.229s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1513.73s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1514.09s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to read off the rules one more time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1515.592s">[Bears]</a>: We're going to move to question and answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1522.0s">[Bears]</a>: All right, so we're gonna follow the following rules for this part of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1527.244s">[Bears]</a>: Members of the public will have one minute to ask one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1530.186s">[Bears]</a>: Members of the public will not be able to ask a second question until everyone has had a chance to ask their first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1535.83s">[Bears]</a>: I'm gonna verbally request that we not ask duplicative or largely similar questions and may move on to the next question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1542.154s">[Bears]</a>: If a duplicative or similar question is asked, counselors will have up to two minutes per counselor to answer each question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1549.653s">[Bears]</a>: I'm requesting the counselors not provide duplicative or largely similar answers to answers that have been already provided by other counselors and may move on to the next counselor for an answer if that happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1560.801s">[Bears]</a>: And after members of the public have had the chance to ask their first question, we'll open the floor to a second question or a short public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1567.885s">[Bears]</a>: And I'm going to be alternating between the chamber and Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1571.588s">[Bears]</a>: So we will start at the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1573.509s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Castanetti, you'll have one minute to ask a question and then we'll go to Zoom after answers from counselors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1605.913s">[Bears]</a>: You got your minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1669.406s">[Bears]</a>: Andy, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1669.986s">[Bears]</a>: That's a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1672.747s">[Bears]</a>: Go ahead and say the sentence minutes up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1690.998s">[Bears]</a>: Let's just hold on here, guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1692.399s">[Bears]</a>: Like, I can't believe we're doing this on the first question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1705.948s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Andy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1706.728s">[Bears]</a>: Does anyone have a response?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1707.969s">[Bears]</a>: Your time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1708.97s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone want to answer the question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1711.811s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Lemke, you have two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1758.291s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1760.752s">[Bears]</a>: We'll move on to the next question, unless anyone else has an answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1765.387s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Andy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1766.187s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Michelle B on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1768.909s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1770.389s">[Bears]</a>: And you'll have one minute to ask your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1817.317s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1817.777s">[Bears]</a>: I'll go to Vice President Collins, then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2177.192s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2177.952s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2182.996s">[Bears]</a>: Just gonna say a few things really quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2189.281s">[Bears]</a>: The council, oh, I'll go to, okay, I'll wait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2192.867s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Zahra, Councilor Lemming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2194.751s">[Bears]</a>: Two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2279.596s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Lemming, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2332.756s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, nope, one time, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2335.838s">[Bears]</a>: It's question eight, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2338.62s">[Bears]</a>: And any other councilors wanna go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2341.322s">[Bears]</a>: I'll be quick, give myself two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2345.203s">[Bears]</a>: I just want to list it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2347.647s">[Bears]</a>: Two literacy interventionists, two behavior specialists, one nurse, four teachers, and four department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2352.873s">[Bears]</a>: Those were cuts that were postponed because we used one-time funds this year to plug the hole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2358.3s">[Bears]</a>: There's another 25 positions, two school counselors, four classroom teachers, two security monitors,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2363.587s">[Bears]</a>: One attendance and re-engagement officer, five paraprofessionals, and 12.2 additional staff members that are on one-time federal funds this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2372.612s">[Bears]</a>: So it's about 35 to 45 staff in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2375.933s">[Bears]</a>: We would not have a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2379.363s">[Bears]</a>: permanent dedicated street and sidewalk crew to use the machines that we already own.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2382.765s">[Bears]</a>: We don't have enough staff in the DPW to actually run those machines four times a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2387.849s">[Bears]</a>: And there would not be significant room for looking at additional compensation for educators, paraprofessionals, and staff in our schools, whether that's just to raise their pay, because it's a contract year, or whether that is when we're talking about extending potentially 10 to 15 minutes to school day to align vocational with the comprehensive high school schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2409.643s">[Bears]</a>: or just to address any issues on time on learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2412.084s">[Bears]</a>: So thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2414.045s">[Bears]</a>: That's what we would lose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2415.906s">[Bears]</a>: We will go to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2417.707s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2419.148s">[Bears]</a>: And you have one minute to ask one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2471.129s">[Bears]</a>: So that's not actually how the tax rates calculated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2474.451s">[Bears]</a>: The assessor just presented the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2476.232s">[Bears]</a>: The levy changes based on the two and a half and new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2481.095s">[Bears]</a>: So it's only about 6 million this year, not 13 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2484.298s">[Bears]</a>: And generally that amount is only going towards fixed costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2489.341s">[Bears]</a>: So we have union contracts, increasing health insurance costs, increasing retirement pension costs, increased costs of materials and pavement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2497.826s">[Bears]</a>: So that's generally what the normal two and a half new growth increase goes towards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2525.102s">[Bears]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2527.093s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2527.994s">[Bears]</a>: Does anyone else want to answer that question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2592.491s">[Bears]</a>: Any other questions from answers from members of the council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2597.633s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, we'll go to the next question on zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2599.914s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Lizzie Charbonneau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2601.955s">[Bears]</a>: Lizzie, you have one minute to ask one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2604.896s">[Bears]</a>: Please provide your name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2665.643s">[Bears]</a>: Go to Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2787.766s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2790.54s">[Bears]</a>: Go to Councilor Lemming, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2913.346s">[Bears]</a>: So let me thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2915.202s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2916.083s">[Bears]</a>: Go to Councilor Scarpelli of two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3055.202s">[Bears]</a>: Go to Councilor Seng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3058.063s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Seng, and then Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3124.732s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3125.112s">[Bears]</a>: The train's gonna zoom in on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3307.334s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3310.814s">[Bears]</a>: I think everybody went on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3312.855s">[Bears]</a>: I'd like to avoid everybody answering every question if we can at all possible, but everyone did give a different answer, which is appreciated context.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3321.76s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just going to be brief myself to ignore my own advice and say, light poles are falling down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3328.284s">[Bears]</a>: We had a meeting two weeks ago where a light pole fell on a public way, and luckily it happened at night, so it didn't hit a car or a person and hurt them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3335.949s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, that's the situation that we're in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3338.79s">[Bears]</a>: We have finally,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3340.106s">[Bears]</a>: appropriated some funds to a capital stabilization fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3342.787s">[Bears]</a>: We have a paper on the meeting at seven o'clock to look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3346.588s">[Bears]</a>: We are in a historic multi-decade deficit where we have massive needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3353.79s">[Bears]</a>: The free cash that is being spoken of is spoken for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3357.079s">[Bears]</a>: It is spoken for, it needs to go to our roads, it needs to go to our schools, it needs to go to fix things that are already broken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3364.464s">[Bears]</a>: And thank you, please stop, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3367.286s">[Bears]</a>: And that's just reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3370.408s">[Bears]</a>: If we use that to plug operating budget holes, we'll have to plug those holes with new revenue in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3376.192s">[Bears]</a>: We can't wait for the new growth from our new zoning, which will take five to 10 years to propagate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3381.796s">[Bears]</a>: And I don't think any of us want more light posts falling in the sink, we certainly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3386.579s">[Bears]</a>: should be grateful that so far they've only been falling at night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3390.221s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3390.542s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to the podium for the next question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3392.863s">[Bears]</a>: You have one minute to ask one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3394.284s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3420.235s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you for your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3421.056s">[Bears]</a>: Would anyone like to answer the question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3426.24s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3528.134s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3528.874s">[Bears]</a>: Any other one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3529.615s">[Bears]</a>: No, that's all I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3531.856s">[Bears]</a>: Two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3657.18s">[Bears]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3660.8s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3663.781s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3678.828s">[Bears]</a>: Rick, Rick, come on, Rick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3681.169s">[Bears]</a>: Don't shout in this room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3682.49s">[Bears]</a>: You know better and you wouldn't take it if you were, you wouldn't take it if you were sitting up here, Rick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3685.911s">[Bears]</a>: Don't, let's not go down this road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3688.083s">[Bears]</a>: Come on, everyone, stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3688.825s">[Bears]</a>: Let's not go down this road, guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3690.468s">[Bears]</a>: It's really not needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3692.112s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan, you have the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3697.702s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, we'll go back to two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3822.115s">[Bears]</a>: 10 seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3835.643s">[Bears]</a>: Wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3835.843s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3837.084s">[Bears]</a>: Tell them the truth, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3838.224s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3841.294s">[Bears]</a>: As a member of the financial task force, it was very clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3845.955s">[Bears]</a>: We actually had a lot of public meetings called fiscal 23 budget process, fiscal 24 budget process, fiscal 25 budget process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3854.118s">[Bears]</a>: I think a lot of folks remember if you're watching those meetings, me sitting in that chair in 2022 and being pretty hard on this mayor because we didn't have the information that we needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3867.503s">[Bears]</a>: and working to establish a task force, working to establish a budget ordinance, working to establish a flow of information, and hear from stakeholders, all the stakeholders that were mentioned in the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3880.017s">[Bears]</a>: What do we need?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3881.178s">[Bears]</a>: What are we not seeing happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3882.659s">[Bears]</a>: Why are we in the situation that we're in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3884.82s">[Bears]</a>: That resulted this year in the earliest budget process we've had with meetings before we got the budget, input from the council and the public before the mayor presented a budget, and a full and accounting of what our serious structural deficit is for our schools and for this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3905.193s">[Bears]</a>: We know that we need more money to do what people want the city to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3909.517s">[Bears]</a>: We're asking the voters to do that, and that's what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3913.818s">[Bears]</a>: If the voters say no, then we will have to make cuts, and we will do that, because that is what the voters decided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3919.259s">[Bears]</a>: If the voters choose to vote yes, then we will have the financial resources that we need to do our jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3925.8s">[Bears]</a>: That is essentially what happened, and that is essentially the choice before us as a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3930.741s">[Bears]</a>: When we want to talk about the financial task force,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3933.402s">[Bears]</a>: was announced in a public meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3935.183s">[Bears]</a>: There are a bunch of public releases from that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3937.585s">[Bears]</a>: Every step of the way, we're starting to meet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3940.327s">[Bears]</a>: Here's what we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3941.829s">[Bears]</a>: Here's what we're considering for the framework.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3943.71s">[Bears]</a>: Here is the final framework.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3945.251s">[Bears]</a>: The specifics were discussed extensively in council meetings and school committee meetings for a year, that these were our budget needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3953.578s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3957.432s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to the podium for the next question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3959.493s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Jones, name and address the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3961.033s">[Bears]</a>: You have a minute for your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3977.48s">[Bears]</a>: And I'm going to give you another 15 seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3979.081s">[Bears]</a>: I just want to say for folks who have joined since I started the meeting,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3982.282s">[Bears]</a>: We're going to be talking about Larry at our meeting after this, and I hope folks have something they want to share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3986.444s">[Bears]</a>: We'll stick around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3987.104s">[Bears]</a>: We want to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3988.885s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4010.526s">[Bears]</a>: Okay, so there was no- It was Councilor Morrell before January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4013.349s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Morrell, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4085.731s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4086.331s">[Bears]</a>: I'll go to Vice President Collins, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4201.323s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, anyone else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4202.163s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4338.136s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4363.074s">[Bears]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4363.554s">[Bears]</a>: Just, I wanted to answer your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4365.256s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4365.656s">[Bears]</a>: I think you heard a good story, but the fact of the matter is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4371.971s">[Bears]</a>: There were five members of the financial task force, the council president, the council vice president, the chair of the school committee, who's the mayor, the vice chair of the school committee, and the chief of staff for the mayor, who administratively runs city hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4383.54s">[Bears]</a>: Those were the members of the task force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4386.943s">[Bears]</a>: Those were the members of the task force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4389.158s">[Bears]</a>: Did we talk to other people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4390.719s">[Bears]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4391.98s">[Bears]</a>: The $3 million number comes from the school finance director from the fiscal 25 budget process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4397.705s">[Bears]</a>: $500,000 number for the DPW street and sidewalk group comes from the DPW commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4402.349s">[Bears]</a>: The $4 million number for the question eight, that comes also from the fiscal 25 and 24 school budget process from the finance director, from many of the administrators in the Medford public schools talking about, this is what we need to do the things that people are asking us to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4417.462s">[Bears]</a>: And the $30 million bond number for the fire headquarters came from the mayor, the chief of staff, and the fire chief based on the design process for the new headquarters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4427.19s">[Bears]</a>: That's where it came from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4428.692s">[Bears]</a>: It's not a bubble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4429.953s">[Bears]</a>: It's not we didn't talk to anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4431.334s">[Bears]</a>: It's not we made things up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4433.075s">[Bears]</a>: There have been documented meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4434.777s">[Bears]</a>: We talked to other people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4436.098s">[Bears]</a>: We engaged the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4437.799s">[Bears]</a>: folks who have the information in the city and said, if we're trying to address these problems, what would it cost?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4443.805s">[Bears]</a>: And that's what the proposals are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4445.426s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, it's plain as day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4447.288s">[Bears]</a>: We have, again, public statements and documents for a year talking about the process, the membership, the framework, and the final result.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4456.076s">[Bears]</a>: We have budget meetings and documents for over<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4460.103s">[Bears]</a>: two and a half, three years, dozens of recordings of this body and the school committee talking about these needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4467.89s">[Bears]</a>: So I encourage folks to look at the last three budget processes, because they'll pretty much get you exactly the numbers that you'll see on the ballot on November 5th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4475.916s">[Bears]</a>: And that's why we're asking voters to vote yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4477.918s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4480.58s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Lemming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4565.855s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Jones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4566.636s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4567.097s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Zoom for the next question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4569.26s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Zoe Moutsos.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4571.063s">[Bears]</a>: One minute to ask your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4572.345s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4636.803s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4637.384s">[Bears]</a>: Go to members of the council to answer that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4644.076s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Lemming, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4724.48s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Councilor Sang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4985.971s">[Bears]</a>: They're not needed right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4990.053s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4990.614s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4991.074s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Councilor Calihan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5027.799s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5028.359s">[Bears]</a>: Go to Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5032.901s">[Bears]</a>: Two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5128.295s">[Bears]</a>: 30 seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5132.097s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5134.237s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone else from the council want to go on this question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5138.854s">[Bears]</a>: Just to Councilor Lemming's point, there was the $34 million certified balance at the end of June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5143.497s">[Bears]</a>: $6 million went to a stabilization fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5147.018s">[Bears]</a>: $5 million went to a capital stabilization fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5150.06s">[Bears]</a>: $1 million of that has already been spent on emergency capital repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5153.422s">[Bears]</a>: $3 million went to the MSBA feasibility study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5157.364s">[Bears]</a>: The mayor also outlined an additional $9.5 million, $2.5 million for fire department fleet replacements, $2 million for the pension liability, which we have to fund by 2034.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5169.008s">[Bears]</a>: $2 million per year for fiscal year 25 capital improvements, $2 million for fiscal year 26 capital improvements, $1 million to match federal and state money to renovate the Hegner Center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5179.474s">[Bears]</a>: We also have the estimated $15 million that we heard the other week from Assistant Superintendent Cushing to fix the HVAC at the Andrews Middle School and McGlynn K-8 school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5190.3s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan has noted the $67 million in road debt, $35 million in sidewalk debt,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5196.301s">[Bears]</a>: People have noted the school water issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5200.405s">[Bears]</a>: As Mr. Belson said, we made money on those schools, but apparently we did it because we didn't put the right stuff in for water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5206.369s">[Bears]</a>: So I just spent all 35 million right there on things that are urgent, right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5213.275s">[Bears]</a>: We're still gonna have to prioritize these urgent capital needs with that free cash and stabilization fund money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5221.221s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, that's plus there's the money in the stabilization funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5224.824s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I just went beyond that though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5228.027s">[Bears]</a>: It's not a scare tactic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5229.068s">[Bears]</a>: It's just math.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5230.989s">[Bears]</a>: It's just math.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5231.75s">[Bears]</a>: That is the need of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5233.271s">[Bears]</a>: I could not name you a community in the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5235.413s">[Bears]</a>: Is that the math that the task force has?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5236.854s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scavalli, please don't interrupt me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5238.876s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5239.316s">[Bears]</a>: I don't interrupt you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5239.977s">[Bears]</a>: Please don't interrupt me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5241.158s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5243.199s">[Bears]</a>: Those are the figures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5244.1s">[Bears]</a>: Those are our needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5246.442s">[Bears]</a>: Those are the capital needs of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5248.484s">[Bears]</a>: So I think,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5250.902s">[Bears]</a>: The math is pretty clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5254.384s">[Bears]</a>: Go to the podium for our next question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5256.045s">[Bears]</a>: One minute, name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5308.393s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone wanna go for that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5309.433s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5378.642s">[Bears]</a>: It's just a clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5379.742s">[Bears]</a>: It's not a follow-up, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5381.443s">[Bears]</a>: What's the question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5383.384s">[Bears]</a>: Well, we're not doing that, so I'd appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5385.424s">[Bears]</a>: What?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5385.865s">[Bears]</a>: We're just asking one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5391.247s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go, we'll think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5393.347s">[Bears]</a>: Who's next?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5395.548s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Lemming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5397.429s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just trying to enforce the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5400.25s">[Bears]</a>: Let me rephrase that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5401.19s">[Bears]</a>: I'll think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5402.111s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Lemming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5405.444s">[Bears]</a>: Oh, we're giving the answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5407.205s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Lemming, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5435.424s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, anyone else wanna answer the question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5437.005s">[Bears]</a>: Sure, Mr. President, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5579.356s">[Bears]</a>: 30 seconds?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5579.777s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5581.078s">[Bears]</a>: What is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5581.738s">[Bears]</a>: You're over by 20 seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5584.841s">[Bears]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5587.723s">[Bears]</a>: You'll get it on the next round, I'm sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5589.525s">[Bears]</a>: I'm sure you'll get it on the next round.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5590.626s">[Bears]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5591.867s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone else want to comment here from the council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5593.928s">[Bears]</a>: You already went, Vice President Collins, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5597.912s">[Bears]</a>: No one gets mad when I don't let Councilor Collins talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5602.261s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just trying to enforce the rules here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5603.881s">[Bears]</a>: If you have a quick clarification on the kind of data you're asking for, I'd be interested to hear it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5628.527s">[Bears]</a>: I can answer that and I'll put my clock on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5632.85s">[Bears]</a>: So for much of it, for the school budget, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5637.432s">[Bears]</a>: The school budget director outlined in the budget meetings in April and May and June, this is what would be cut if we didn't have these funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5645.157s">[Bears]</a>: And this is what would have to be cut if we don't have these funds in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5647.858s">[Bears]</a>: So in that case, it is an exact one-to-one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5650.46s">[Bears]</a>: And that's true for all of question seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5652.661s">[Bears]</a>: When we talk about the DPW, the director said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5656.704s">[Bears]</a>: to run the machines four days a week instead of two or four days a month, I need this much staff, this is how much that crew would cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5664.249s">[Bears]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5665.33s">[Bears]</a>: For the debt exclusion for the fire station, Councilor Scarpelli already noted, right, we have bond capacity, we're maxed on our bond capacity, we have a library on the bond capacity, we have a police station on the bond capacity, we have school, MHS labs on the bond capacity, we're pretty much maxed on the bond capacity here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5681.08s">[Bears]</a>: And, okay, well,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5688.785s">[Bears]</a>: You're wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5689.605s">[Bears]</a>: It's in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5690.546s">[Bears]</a>: You're wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5691.066s">[Bears]</a>: I'm not wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5691.767s">[Bears]</a>: I read the thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5694.088s">[Bears]</a>: So when we talk about the information that's available to the public, there's information from the school budget process, from the city budget process that outlines these needs very clearly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5705.695s">[Bears]</a>: There have been charts and tables and narratives and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5711.098s">[Bears]</a>: whatever other form of data analysis you want has likely been presented at these meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5714.824s">[Bears]</a>: So there is information out there, there is data out there, and when we talk about the decisions made by the financial task force, while other members of the city staff were not members of the financial task force,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5726.721s">[Bears]</a>: they were consulted, these issues were discussed with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5729.925s">[Bears]</a>: So that is what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5733.389s">[Bears]</a>: And we can continue to try to present the math and information in a different way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5736.913s">[Bears]</a>: And I'm sure that we will continue to try to get that information out there as best as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5741.738s">[Bears]</a>: But the city has incredible needs, significant needs, and funding is needed to meet them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5749.923s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5750.343s">[Bears]</a>: I only have one hand raised on Zoom, but it's iPhone 109.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5755.049s">[Bears]</a>: If you would please rename yourself so that we know that you're a person, I'll then recognize you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5760.936s">[Bears]</a>: Until then, I'll go to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5762.257s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5763.458s">[Bears]</a>: You have one minute for your questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5812.03s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5815.478s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone wanna go for it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5817.539s">[Bears]</a>: I can do the financial task force part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5820.601s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone wanna talk about the sufficiency of the size of the override?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5826.545s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Lemming, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5912.34s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5914.181s">[Bears]</a>: Councillor Zara, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6024.965s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6025.685s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone else want to go on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6027.786s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, anyone else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6029.307s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6188.22s">[Bears]</a>: Sorry, one second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6189.121s">[Bears]</a>: We're still answering the question from Mr. Givino.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6192.625s">[Bears]</a>: I saw Councillor Saint and Councillor Collins, and I have an answer about the financial task force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6211.364s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6301.662s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Sang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6302.543s">[Bears]</a>: I think I got it on the task force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6306.869s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks Mr. Gimeno for the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6309.791s">[Bears]</a>: So when we talk about sufficiency of the override, in the public documents that have been repeatedly asserted don't exist, but are of course public and on the website, the financial task force has said that we believe that this override and debt exclusion is sufficient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6324.727s">[Bears]</a>: along with whatever needs to be done for the high school, which we all knew always was going to be an independent question to allow the city's planning and development work based on the comprehensive plan and the zoning recodification and ongoing zoning work to take effect to begin to raise the funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6339.21s">[Bears]</a>: So yes, right now in the public documents that have been released, I think both the March document and the June document talk about that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6347.671s">[Bears]</a>: We believe that not only is this the best path forward for the city's financial health,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6351.412s">[Bears]</a>: but that the amounts are sufficient that we would not be coming back in the next five to 10 years outside of a Medford High School question to address the city's financial health and challenges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6360.463s">[Bears]</a>: When it comes to the Financial Task Force question, Financial Task Force was not a public body, did not include, for example, members of the public, appointed citizens, etc.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6369.033s">[Bears]</a>: It was an internal body to City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6372.034s">[Bears]</a>: similar to project meetings in different departments, interdepartmental groups designed for different projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6380.079s">[Bears]</a>: So that is why it was held internally and not in publicly posted meetings and public meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6389.024s">[Bears]</a>: I'm gonna go to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6391.145s">[Bears]</a>: We have Deanne I. You have one minute for a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6395.107s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6431.638s">[Bears]</a>: I think you said 451, but it sounds like you got the 51 right, so it may have been a misspeak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6444.727s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, sometimes we just have a little misspeak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6449.671s">[Bears]</a>: All right, anyone wanna answer those questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6453.133s">[Bears]</a>: I can get money where the money goes, but if anyone else wants to go for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6459.281s">[Bears]</a>: All right, in terms of where the money goes, $3 million from Question 7 goes to Medford Public Schools to replace $1.7 million in one-time funds that were used for Fiscal 25 to cover positions to address the inclusion of federally funded<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6477.174s">[Bears]</a>: pandemic aid positions and to address maintenance costs, $500,000 would go to DDPW to hire staff to have a permanent in-house road and sidewalk repair crew, and $4 million would go to the school to address a number of issues, mainly collectively bargained issues around pay for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6495.852s">[Bears]</a>: teachers, paraprofessionals, staff, addressing the issue of the school day, and potentially also addressing issues such as coaches, stipends, and transportation, depending on what is prioritized during the next budget process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6509.502s">[Bears]</a>: And for question six, that is dedicated to a new fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6515.846s">[Bears]</a>: I'll go to Councilor Scarpa and then Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6518.048s">[Bears]</a>: Two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6638.558s">[Bears]</a>: That's what I ask all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6639.999s">[Bears]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6640.959s">[Bears]</a>: Appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6677.626s">[Bears]</a>: It is a sustainable source of revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6705.377s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, specifically it would be appropriated if they were passed, there would be an appropriation in the first year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6711.798s">[Bears]</a>: The appropriation would be as outlined in the ballot questions in future years, budgets would have to be cut in order to reappropriate those funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6720.0s">[Bears]</a>: So, um, and I don't think anyone behind this rail has ever supported cutting teachers or the school budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6730.655s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6731.959s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6733.043s">[Bears]</a>: You have one minute to ask your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6841.314s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you for the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6843.415s">[Bears]</a>: I can go to other folks, but I do have the answer, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6847.537s">[Bears]</a>: So in terms of the temporary versus permanent, question six is a debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6853.08s">[Bears]</a>: So it's temporary in the sense that there's the $30 million amount for the bond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6858.783s">[Bears]</a>: The $2 billion that you cited is an estimate for the annual debt service cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6863.686s">[Bears]</a>: That estimate was created to try to give folks an understanding of what that might look like on an annual basis on their tax impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6871.751s">[Bears]</a>: So that's a temporary until the bond is paid off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6874.574s">[Bears]</a>: For question seven and eight, those would be permanent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6879.899s">[Bears]</a>: Those are overrides intended to be permanent increases to the levy limit to fund ongoing operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6886.686s">[Bears]</a>: In terms of the line items, I believe there is a page on the city website right now that does outline the specifics that I just said in terms of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6895.413s">[Bears]</a>: 3 million for the MPS and 500,000 for the DPW in question seven and the 4 million in question eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6903.54s">[Bears]</a>: I can look at seeing if the city might be able to also add a graphic there, but I believe if you go to medfordma.org, there's a button right on the front page that says override information, and it does outline the line items for each specific question to the greatest extent possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6933.074s">[Bears]</a>: So we do, it would be 3.5 million for question seven and 4 million for question eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6938.455s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6939.195s">[Bears]</a>: And that's the max, it can't go higher than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6942.496s">[Bears]</a>: And those are not funding any sort of bonds or debt exclusions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6945.716s">[Bears]</a>: Those are for the override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6948.917s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6981.208s">[Bears]</a>: That's not the format here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6982.269s">[Bears]</a>: We'll take public comment at the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7084.02s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7086.361s">[Bears]</a>: Just on the point about question six, Department of Revenue guidelines, it can be for the bonded amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7092.706s">[Bears]</a>: It's not written into the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7093.846s">[Bears]</a>: That's because of how the Proposition 2.5 law is written.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7096.633s">[Bears]</a>: but it is for the $30 million plus minor project changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7100.936s">[Bears]</a>: It is not a blank check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7102.337s">[Bears]</a>: It is not just an open thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7103.738s">[Bears]</a>: Department of Revenue has extent, the State Department of Revenue has extensive guidelines on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7108.962s">[Bears]</a>: So if there are minor project changes or construction related inflation adjustments, those could be included, but they have to be minor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7116.588s">[Bears]</a>: If there's a significant increase to the budget, it would have to either be going out for another bond funded by another revenue source or funded by an additional debt exclusion vote of the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7126.843s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7127.243s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to go to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7129.384s">[Bears]</a>: We have Christina Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7131.004s">[Bears]</a>: Christina, you have one minute to ask your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7133.944s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7184.924s">[Bears]</a>: So thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7196.336s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to the podium, name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7199.739s">[Bears]</a>: You have a minute to ask your questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7293.618s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you for the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7295.063s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to members of the Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7296.328s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Zaro, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7341.411s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Lemming, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7372.742s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just getting there if we could just maintain decorum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7375.644s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7449.468s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7449.789s">[Bears]</a>: We're going to Councilor Sang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7478.069s">[Bears]</a>: Um, I mean, I can answer the question more specifically or vice president Collins, but, um, if you don't mind, mine is on a different part of the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7485.333s">[Bears]</a>: This what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7487.834s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7488.774s">[Bears]</a>: On this specific question, when we were looking at the financial state of the city, we said, what is the biggest capital obligation that the city is going to have over the next five to 10 years, other than a high school, which we've excluded from everyone acknowledges is such a big project needs to be handled on its own.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7505.74s">[Bears]</a>: It was a new fire headquarters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7507.981s">[Bears]</a>: We can get into the back and forth dispute over should there have been a combined headquarters?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7511.622s">[Bears]</a>: Should this have been 10, 10 years ago?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7514.008s">[Bears]</a>: Those, quite frankly, were decisions that were made before I was even thinking about running for office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7519.817s">[Bears]</a>: When we looked at that, we said, that's the biggest expense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7523.342s">[Bears]</a>: If we ask the voters to do that as a debt exclusion, it means that bond capacity is available for many of the other things that we've talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7530.39s">[Bears]</a>: Now we looked at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7532.172s">[Bears]</a>: There has been an owner's project manager hired by the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7534.935s">[Bears]</a>: The mayor has controlled the design process, has included, my understanding, chiefs, has not included the union or firefighters to the level that they've wanted to be included, and has never included this council in the design process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7547.668s">[Bears]</a>: We're not part of the design process for the fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7550.811s">[Bears]</a>: We made a decision based on the financial health of the community, based on the estimates provided by the designer, the mayor, and the fire chief, that a $30 million fire station is what they think will need to be built.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7561.556s">[Bears]</a>: The design is not finalized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7564.057s">[Bears]</a>: My understanding is that changes can and are being made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7569.38s">[Bears]</a>: But to us, it was a separate question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7571.381s">[Bears]</a>: The design process is not something that this council has been involved in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7576.104s">[Bears]</a>: But the financial health of the community is obviously something that we work on during the budget process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7581.469s">[Bears]</a>: And so identifying this project as what should be funded by a debt exclusion was how we made that decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7590.138s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7591.139s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7625.592s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7627.434s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7752.98s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7755.901s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you for this question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7760.402s">[Bears]</a>: All right, we'll go to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7764.275s">[Bears]</a>: I'm a little wary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7765.497s">[Bears]</a>: Bill on Zoom, if you could provide a last name or a last initial, we'll go to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7770.825s">[Bears]</a>: Damon, address record, you have a minute to ask your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7817.622s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7818.002s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, I will give you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7819.713s">[Bears]</a>: I wasn't expecting you to go around the rules here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7822.455s">[Bears]</a>: My point was not that the people involved did a bad job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7825.037s">[Bears]</a>: My point was clearly this was an issue that was missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7828.26s">[Bears]</a>: And there was a comment made by someone very involved in those projects at a political event, quote, we made money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7836.487s">[Bears]</a>: And I think that that's just something that should be entertained as maybe also maybe not representing the work or the goals of that committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7844.994s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7845.794s">[Bears]</a>: So you can have your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7855.8s">[Bears]</a>: I've sat down with some people who are on that committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7858.021s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7860.682s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7861.202s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7863.339s">[Bears]</a>: You have a minute to ask your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7905.822s">[Bears]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7906.162s">[Bears]</a>: I know I'm going to go for that two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7908.884s">[Bears]</a>: Council vice president Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8031.82s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8032.26s">[Bears]</a>: We're not going back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8033.481s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone else want to go on this question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8034.762s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Zaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8134.03s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8138.153s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8139.434s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8139.734s">[Bears]</a>: We, we can talk about water sewer infrastructure for another couple hours if we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8145.277s">[Bears]</a>: Um, it's a big problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8147.078s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone else have a answer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8148.499s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Lenders question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8149.8s">[Bears]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8150.26s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8271.309s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8273.973s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8356.223s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8359.69s">[Bears]</a>: Just to get specific, when we talk about the needs in the classroom, 85% of the school budget is salaries and staff, 15% is non-salary and staff expenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8369.958s">[Bears]</a>: Likely the vast majority of both of these questions through collective bargaining will end up going to either hiring more staff or paying existing staff more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8378.181s">[Bears]</a>: The specifics outlined in the fiscal 25 budget process by the schools are eight classroom teachers, five paraprofessionals, two literacy interventionists, two behavior specialists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8389.346s">[Bears]</a>: I think those are all significant impact on the students in the room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8392.928s">[Bears]</a>: A nurse, a school administrative assistant at the McGlynn, which right now is operating with one administrative assistant instead of two for a complex of over 1,000 kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8402.392s">[Bears]</a>: We could say those aren't in the classroom, but I think we know those would help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8405.188s">[Bears]</a>: in the classroom and help kids as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8407.309s">[Bears]</a>: So those are the real life impacts of what this would go to fund, nevermind the idea of paying paraprofessionals a living wage, hiring more staff to reduce class sizes or other things that would be possible through the collective bargaining process with the teachers union and the paraprofessionals union.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8425.68s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8428.862s">[Bears]</a>: We have Bill O'Brien, name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8431.503s">[Bears]</a>: You have a minute to ask your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8488.026s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8490.871s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone have questions or answers on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8493.573s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Lemming, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8533.271s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, anyone else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8534.952s">[Bears]</a>: Sure, Mr. President, if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8536.072s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarbelli, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8673.226s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8675.766s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8813.194s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8814.895s">[Bears]</a>: I'll leave it there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8815.636s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8821.8s">[Bears]</a>: Number one, I appreciate your comments, Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8824.741s">[Bears]</a>: Number two, I wanna say very clearly to the question, why did we pass the budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8829.224s">[Bears]</a>: When I'm talking about, someone have their phone on, someone watching in the room?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8837.31s">[Bears]</a>: If you could take that out of the room, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8841.253s">[Bears]</a>: Well, you gotta, just don't wanna have it backlogging in the, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8848.364s">[Bears]</a>: Just to be clear, to answer the question, when we're talking about collective bargaining agreements, we're talking about future contracts, not current contracts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8856.109s">[Bears]</a>: As was noted, that's not recommended by, I think, councilors who disagree on the substance, it's not recommended to use free cash for operating budget issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8864.135s">[Bears]</a>: Certainly it's not recommended to use free cash to negotiate contracts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8869.018s">[Bears]</a>: So we're talking about the capacity of the city to negotiate future contracts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8873.441s">[Bears]</a>: I think that was the question asked by Mr. O'Brien.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8878.39s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to the podium, name and address the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8881.051s">[Bears]</a>: You have one minute to ask your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8963.979s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8964.459s">[Bears]</a>: We're over by about 20 seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8979.391s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you for your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8981.732s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone want to take it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8989.698s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9061.479s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9062.6s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9065.021s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9065.821s">[Bears]</a>: Please stop interrupting the proceedings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9067.862s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9069.063s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Leving, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9075.165s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9075.465s">[Bears]</a>: It looks like she left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9077.526s">[Bears]</a>: Oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9078.627s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9078.967s">[Bears]</a>: Good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9139.485s">[Bears]</a>: Talking with the assessor's office, their estimate is that given declining interest rates for municipal bonds, given the contingency already in the project, and also the DLS, sorry, DOR, State Department of Revenue guidelines around debt exclusions, that it would essentially stay around the $30 million total cost for the debt service, for the bond, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9167.54s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, but the interest rate would be,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9169.617s">[Bears]</a>: set when the debt is issued.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9172.878s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Zoom, Sharon Diesso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9177.04s">[Bears]</a>: Oh, sorry, you wanna go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9180.041s">[Bears]</a>: Sorry, I didn't see your hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9181.662s">[Bears]</a>: Go ahead, Councilor Scarpa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9182.862s">[Bears]</a>: Sharon, you have to wait a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9237.509s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think anyone's saying that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9299.379s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Sharon or Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9348.618s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9349.139s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9351.38s">[Bears]</a>: Sharon Diesso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9352.14s">[Bears]</a>: You have one minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9354.401s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9355.701s">[Bears]</a>: Please ask your one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9404.908s">[Bears]</a>: Do you have a question, Sharon?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9406.448s">[Bears]</a>: You have 10 seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9437.343s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Sharon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9441.706s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just following the rules, guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9443.187s">[Bears]</a>: I think everyone needs to take a deep breath before groaning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9451.172s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone wanna go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9451.793s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, anybody?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9458.34s">[Bears]</a>: Her question was, what were the alternatives that could have been found that are not the overrides and debt exclusions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9595.656s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9596.076s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9598.715s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Lemming, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9684.803s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9686.67s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone else on these questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9691.432s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9693.173s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Sanz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9695.194s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9697.755s">[Bears]</a>: Just to be brief, you know, we have had for the last three years, the best three years of new growth in the city in the last 25 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9706.498s">[Bears]</a>: Those are just, again, the facts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9707.959s">[Bears]</a>: They're on the DLS webpage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9710.58s">[Bears]</a>: We can't disagree with data and mathematics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9713.423s">[Bears]</a>: Data and mathematics are not fear tactics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9716.085s">[Bears]</a>: They are just the facts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9718.867s">[Bears]</a>: Alternatives, there was no way in the short to medium term to raise reliable, recurring, sustainable revenue to fund operating budget expenses, except for asking the voters to fund those expenses through an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9731.919s">[Bears]</a>: The property tax levy is the vast majority of the money that the city brings in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9736.243s">[Bears]</a>: The state is not providing the city with significant new aid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9739.687s">[Bears]</a>: The city departments go above and beyond finding federal and state grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9743.391s">[Bears]</a>: They are looking far and wide for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9746.495s">[Bears]</a>: Just because we don't receive them doesn't mean we didn't apply for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9750.399s">[Bears]</a>: And to be honest, a lot of the formulas and ways that those things are decided are not favoring places like Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9756.065s">[Bears]</a>: because the state school formula looks at our city and they say, Oh, they should pay more in property taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9761.888s">[Bears]</a>: We're not going to send them more state aid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9763.589s">[Bears]</a>: That's literally how the formula is written.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9765.39s">[Bears]</a>: It's based on capacity for a city to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9768.532s">[Bears]</a>: So when we are 93rd out of 97 for property tax revenue, when we are 94th out of 97 for per capita spending, we are where we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9777.056s">[Bears]</a>: The state's judges us based on that reality and says, we're not giving them more money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9782.719s">[Bears]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9784.625s">[Bears]</a>: Again, we came together over dozens of public meetings over three budget cycles addressing needs of the city and the school department and said, this is the best way to raise sustainable recurring revenue to fund city operating budget expenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9798.579s">[Bears]</a>: We believe this is the best path forward in the short to medium term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9801.562s">[Bears]</a>: And we are going to ask the voters to make that decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9803.625s">[Bears]</a>: The voters are, the voters are going to vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9806.209s">[Bears]</a>: We'll see what happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9807.31s">[Bears]</a>: I certainly hope they vote one way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9809.191s">[Bears]</a>: Other counselors may hope that they vote another way, but I don't envy anyone in any, I don't think any of us are going to be excited to do the budget if these funds are not available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9823.422s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to the podium, name and address record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9825.264s">[Bears]</a>: You have one minute to ask your question, name and address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9851.893s">[Bears]</a>: Please address your questions through the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9891.094s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Merritt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9894.396s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone wanna go for that one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9896.257s">[Bears]</a>: I have some answers on the Cambridge fire station, why it's not a good comparison, but go to Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9909.422s">[Bears]</a>: The Cambridge Fire Station was a historic renovation of a historic 125-year-old fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9915.627s">[Bears]</a>: They were installing geothermal energy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9919.31s">[Bears]</a>: It's just completely incomparable to the project that we're talking about in Medford Square, which is a knockdown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9926.115s">[Bears]</a>: Again, the cost overruns were mainly due to historic preservation issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9930.118s">[Bears]</a>: and projects that they were trying to add in there that are not things that we're trying to add to our station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9935.102s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone else on the question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9939.305s">[Bears]</a>: Seat down, we'll go to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9940.366s">[Bears]</a>: We have Micah Kesselman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9941.607s">[Bears]</a>: Micah, you have one minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9942.708s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9945.39s">[Bears]</a>: Please ask one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10006.05s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10006.591s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone want to go for that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10013.581s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Lemming, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10020.306s">[Bears]</a>: I think the question was specifically, how would free cash become a sustainable solution for ongoing operating expenses?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10064.514s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10065.174s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10065.754s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, question is how would free cash be a sustainable solution?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10193.5s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Stroud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10196.421s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone else on this question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10199.682s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, we'll go to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10202.748s">[Bears]</a>: Is it Simon?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10204.289s">[Bears]</a>: All right, Simon, you might have to bend the microphone down a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10210.272s">[Bears]</a>: Oh, nevermind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10218.657s">[Bears]</a>: A direct and simple question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10220.117s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone want to go on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10222.879s">[Bears]</a>: I'll go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10225.24s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10282.21s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10284.231s">[Bears]</a>: I'll take this one, Simon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10285.811s">[Bears]</a>: I'll go to Anna, and then I'll go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10287.832s">[Bears]</a>: Anna?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10344.255s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10344.795s">[Bears]</a>: And Simon, thank you for asking your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10347.056s">[Bears]</a>: I know you've been at a few of these meetings now and you've asked a few questions now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10351.058s">[Bears]</a>: I know you remember some meetings from the springtime of the school committee where we were really worried about whether we were going to be able to keep all the teachers and the paraprofessionals and all the other people in your school who try to make your day a good day and make sure you learn something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10365.743s">[Bears]</a>: Um, we were able, uh, this year to keep most of those people by using the one-time funds that we're talking about, um, that the city had staved up, but in the long run, um, it's really difficult, uh, for us to keep that promise if we don't have the money to keep paying people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10385.098s">[Bears]</a>: So, um, question seven, as Anna noted, um, would allow us to make sure that we can keep everybody on, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10393.677s">[Bears]</a>: who's there now, we don't have to look at asking people to leave, firing people, laying people off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10399.662s">[Bears]</a>: And question eight means that the city and the schools have a lot more opportunity to give our teachers and the people in your school the pay that they deserve to have more staff in the schools to help out in the classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10413.633s">[Bears]</a>: And if we don't,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10414.87s">[Bears]</a>: see a yes vote on those two questions, it's going to be a lot harder for the city to do those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10419.214s">[Bears]</a>: So, um, we're, we're going to do our best no matter what happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10423.118s">[Bears]</a>: And one hard thing about democracy that you might be learning pretty young is sometimes people don't agree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10429.203s">[Bears]</a>: And sometimes people make a decision that you don't want them to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10431.905s">[Bears]</a>: And if that happens, we're going to do our very best to try to make sure that everything stays okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10436.47s">[Bears]</a>: Um, but if people do say yes, it'll be easier for us to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10441.014s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10444.421s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10448.423s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10450.584s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10451.805s">[Bears]</a>: We have Jess H. Name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10455.546s">[Bears]</a>: You have one minute to ask one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10505.281s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you for your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10506.422s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Councilor Collins and Councilor Zara.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10570.148s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10570.708s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Zaro, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10646.27s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone else on this question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10651.384s">[Bears]</a>: I can just note quickly that the one-time funds used to avoid cuts this year that were postponed saved two literacy interventionists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10662.851s">[Bears]</a>: I think two positions were eliminated and those could be restored.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10669.816s">[Bears]</a>: There's also talk about the curriculum around literacy and what that would take to implement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10676.741s">[Bears]</a>: I do agree with Councilor Zaro that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10679.775s">[Bears]</a>: talking to school committee, school administration, they'd be able to provide more information and details.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10684.359s">[Bears]</a>: And I don't know if either of those solutions would help your child or your specific situation, but I do know that paying our paraprofessionals more to reduce turnover, help students with disabilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10695.909s">[Bears]</a>: I know that investing more in interventionists and specialists helps our students with disabilities and the school having more resources to do that would help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10705.658s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10712.793s">[Bears]</a>: The person on Zoom is Micah Kesselman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10716.162s">[Bears]</a>: So we'll go back to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10718.047s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10719.13s">[Bears]</a>: You have one minute to ask one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10850.007s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10851.869s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone want to talk about that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10854.872s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10938.801s">[Bears]</a>: I believe that's based on time on learning statistics issued by the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10947.187s">[Bears]</a>: Well, I believe that's where the information is coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10949.048s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpaletti, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11081.215s">[Bears]</a>: That's two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11081.956s">[Bears]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11082.837s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11083.397s">[Bears]</a>: Could you please, next time, give me that 10 seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11085.199s">[Bears]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11085.739s">[Bears]</a>: No, I appreciate it a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11087.261s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11087.701s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11201.818s">[Bears]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11252.639s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11253.28s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Lazaro, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11280.79s">[Bears]</a>: Let's just take a pause here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11284.153s">[Bears]</a>: It's been three hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11287.315s">[Bears]</a>: The state formula doesn't work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11289.136s">[Bears]</a>: Hold on, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11289.917s">[Bears]</a>: Can I speak, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11290.757s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11292.637s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11293.718s">[Bears]</a>: Three hours in, we've been pretty good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11295.338s">[Bears]</a>: I appreciate everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11297.459s">[Bears]</a>: We've had a difficult conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11303.642s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think anyone, I think there's been a lot of back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11307.244s">[Bears]</a>: Cheryl, I don't want to talk about commenting on aggressiveness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11310.505s">[Bears]</a>: We can interpret people's comments in many ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11312.726s">[Bears]</a>: I think you would agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11313.907s">[Bears]</a>: You don't want unfavorable interpretation of your comments and neither does councilor Zara.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11316.728s">[Bears]</a>: And I think we're going to leave it at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11321.088s">[Bears]</a>: To your point, we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11322.728s">[Bears]</a>: We constantly advocate for more state money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11324.649s">[Bears]</a>: To your point, and I'm putting my two minutes on now, the state formula is not good for Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11330.511s">[Bears]</a>: Even with the Student Opportunity Act, even with Chapter 70 money, given the charter formula, given the reimbursement formula, it's bad for Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11337.513s">[Bears]</a>: Even with a 5% increase in ELL, which is one of the big sources of funding in the Chapter 70 formula, we're not getting a lot more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11345.196s">[Bears]</a>: The main reason for that is because of our estimated<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11348.41s">[Bears]</a>: you know, minimum contribution as a city, what the state plans to give us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11352.572s">[Bears]</a>: And a lot of that is based on what is the city's capacity to pay for things itself versus the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11358.336s">[Bears]</a>: Malden gets $60 million a year in net aid for their schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11362.638s">[Bears]</a>: We get 11.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11366.359s">[Bears]</a>: Well, I mean, you know, I would, I would love to, I would love if the formula treated us better, but it doesn't because essentially because of our property values.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11374.549s">[Bears]</a>: I wanted to get to your point, um, specifically on these questions, question eight, it's not just for the high school schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11383.74s">[Bears]</a>: It's that's one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11385.131s">[Bears]</a>: That's one of three things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11386.232s">[Bears]</a>: It's high school schedule alignment so that vocational and arts kids can do both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11391.036s">[Bears]</a>: It's expanding classroom instructional opportunities district-wide, whether that means more staff or more teachers, and it's classroom teacher and paraprofessional compensation, so paying existing staff more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11405.952s">[Bears]</a>: I can read you the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11407.113s">[Bears]</a>: Shall the city of Medford be allowed to assess an additional $4 million in real estate and personal property taxes for FY 25 general operations of the Medford Public Schools to create a high school schedule that increases access to arts and vacational programming, expand classroom instructional opportunities, and for classroom teacher and paraprofessional compensation for the fiscal year beginning July 1st, 2024?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11426.57s">[Bears]</a>: That's the whole question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11428.032s">[Bears]</a>: It's for all three of those purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11429.98s">[Bears]</a>: The district spends 85% of its budget on salaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11433.143s">[Bears]</a>: And the reason it's not more specific is because to get more specific would be to violate collective bargaining laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11437.746s">[Bears]</a>: All of that has to be bargained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11439.628s">[Bears]</a>: So it gives us the money to have that conversation with our educators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11443.491s">[Bears]</a>: And these have been ongoing questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11445.172s">[Bears]</a>: So I'm really hopeful it passes because I'd like to pay our teachers more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11448.815s">[Bears]</a>: I'd like to pay our paraprofessionals more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11450.857s">[Bears]</a>: And I'd also like to fix the school day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11455.848s">[Bears]</a>: Let's move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11456.628s">[Bears]</a>: We're going to move to the next question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11459.33s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11461.292s">[Bears]</a>: Matt, let me run the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11463.073s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11465.975s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to the podium because the person on Zoom has already asked a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11469.437s">[Bears]</a>: Name, address, record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11470.158s">[Bears]</a>: You have one minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11492.27s">[Bears]</a>: Is that the whole question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11493.111s">[Bears]</a>: No, it's not the whole question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11494.351s">[Bears]</a>: Cause I know the rest of the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11525.621s">[Bears]</a>: I'll give you 10 more seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11563.731s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you for the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11564.651s">[Bears]</a>: Does anyone want to go for it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11566.613s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Collins, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11655.715s">[Bears]</a>: And I'm not trying to be disrespectful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11657.635s">[Bears]</a>: That's my honest opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11658.775s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone else want to go on this question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11664.257s">[Bears]</a>: Anybody else on the question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11665.237s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11668.278s">[Bears]</a>: I'll just say for one bill, I'll go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11670.998s">[Bears]</a>: I think it's actually a symptom of the same problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11674.298s">[Bears]</a>: to go 25 years without addressing and correcting that issue is the same reason that we're talking about all the other deferred questions, deferred issues, deferred things in the scope of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11686.737s">[Bears]</a>: 25 years of not adjusting that compensation amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11689.426s">[Bears]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11689.747s">[Bears]</a>: It went from 2000 to 2024 without being adjusted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11693.452s">[Bears]</a>: And so I think it's actually a symptom of the same problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11698.179s">[Bears]</a>: I'm not going to discuss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11699.701s">[Bears]</a>: I'm talking in the big picture, Bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11701.945s">[Bears]</a>: We're talking about on every single thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11706.425s">[Bears]</a>: basically every single thing in the city, water, sewer, school buildings, fire station, funding of the DPW staff, funding of paraprofessional pay, the school day, the vocational.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11716.255s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, I could give you a 30 point litany list of things that the city spent 20 or 30 or 40 years not fixing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11723.837s">[Bears]</a>: This was one of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11724.658s">[Bears]</a>: It was within our authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11725.799s">[Bears]</a>: It's a symptom of that larger problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11727.922s">[Bears]</a>: We fixed that one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11729.484s">[Bears]</a>: Now we're asking the voters to fix a larger set of problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11732.587s">[Bears]</a>: And I don't think those things are in Congress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11734.229s">[Bears]</a>: That's just my opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11735.631s">[Bears]</a>: And I appreciate your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11854.256s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11855.077s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone else on this question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11856.358s">[Bears]</a>: I see none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11858.52s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to the podium, name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11860.381s">[Bears]</a>: You have one minute to ask one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11918.086s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone want to go on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11922.359s">[Bears]</a>: I really should be going last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12088.265s">[Bears]</a>: Are you asking for a clarification?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12091.578s">[Bears]</a>: If you're asking for a clarification, you can clarify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12094.599s">[Bears]</a>: Okay, all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12097.281s">[Bears]</a>: Just to your point, to your question, yes, we're talking about fiscal 26.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12101.362s">[Bears]</a>: Teachers contract, Paris contract, both expired June 30, 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12104.223s">[Bears]</a>: So we're talking about a new contract year and the increased pay for that would be on the new year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12110.206s">[Bears]</a>: That's if there are no agreements or side agreements settled before then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12113.867s">[Bears]</a>: You know, we're seeing significant costs, essentially,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12118.576s">[Bears]</a>: all of the two and a half increase and most of the new growth increase are being used to pay for fixed cost growth increases on things that we've already committed to do, either in contracts or where we have mandatory spending on health insurance and pensions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12130.328s">[Bears]</a>: So, yes, this would be for fiscal 26.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12133.171s">[Bears]</a>: We're currently, once again, this year, we're doing basically what Councilor Scarpelli said, we're using one-time funds right now to cover the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12141.144s">[Bears]</a>: to try to get us through to a point when we have reliable recurring revenue, which the financial task force has put forward in the form of these overrides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12148.01s">[Bears]</a>: And if that is not available, that's when in the it's next year, but it's the budget process is going to happen from February to June upcoming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12155.696s">[Bears]</a>: It's in the next few months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12157.498s">[Bears]</a>: That's when those decisions will be made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12158.959s">[Bears]</a>: And whether or not we know we have the reliable, sustainable revenue to pay for those things, or we don't is dependent on the override questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12167.967s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12206.26s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12207.721s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone else on the question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12210.682s">[Bears]</a>: All right, we'll go to another question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12213.524s">[Bears]</a>: Still someone who's already asked on Zoom, so we'll go to first time question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12218.946s">[Bears]</a>: Two minutes, or one minute, one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12221.487s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12318.951s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12319.471s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12322.473s">[Bears]</a>: Two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12469.249s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Collins, I let you go way over, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12470.91s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12471.231s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12472.912s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12473.152s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12473.733s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Lemming, two minutes, then Councilor Zaro, then Councilor Sang, then Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12574.71s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12578.697s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Seng, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12580.137s">[Bears]</a>: Or did I get that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12580.798s">[Bears]</a>: Or was it Councilor Zaro?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12582.058s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Zaro, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12841.433s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12844.395s">[Bears]</a>: Councillor Kiley, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12898.137s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12898.677s">[Bears]</a>: I just wanted to, I did have a couple quick answers to your question too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12904.491s">[Bears]</a>: It's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12905.411s">[Bears]</a>: Bill keeps posting online something I posted, I think about five years ago where I said, I don't think we need an override right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12910.994s">[Bears]</a>: I want to explore all the other options first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12913.314s">[Bears]</a>: And then we did, we explored short-term rentals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12915.615s">[Bears]</a>: We explored marijuana revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12917.076s">[Bears]</a>: We started on the zoning, which has borne some fruit and will bear more, but not fast enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12923.598s">[Bears]</a>: You know, we maxed out the local fees and stuff like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12927.987s">[Bears]</a>: the hotel meals and rooms, et cetera, to the most, the state will let us do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12932.97s">[Bears]</a>: We're trying to get the state to open up the home roll petition so we can update the linkage fees for the first time in 30 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12938.393s">[Bears]</a>: I had a resolution on for a fee schedule update to look at the whole city fee schedule to which many of them haven't been updated in many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12948.478s">[Bears]</a>: So we're going to get a response back on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12950.64s">[Bears]</a>: All of that does not generate a significant enough amount of revenue to address the needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12954.742s">[Bears]</a>: That's why I feel that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12957.327s">[Bears]</a>: in all the six years of budgets that I've worked on and everything else, my answer to the question is, we've looked at all the other buckets that we have control over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12966.849s">[Bears]</a>: They're no longer sufficient to address the need, and that's why I support these overrides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12970.91s">[Bears]</a>: So that's just one piece of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12974.07s">[Bears]</a>: On the development, Somerville started its significant summer vision plans 20, 25 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12980.092s">[Bears]</a>: They started seeing the first fruits of that in significant way 15 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12984.292s">[Bears]</a>: It's really boomed the last five to 10 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12987.333s">[Bears]</a>: We're at the beginning of that process, not the middle, not the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12990.255s">[Bears]</a>: I wish we'd started that 25 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12992.196s">[Bears]</a>: I think I'd be much happier during budget season if we started that 25 years ago, because the decisions would be a lot easier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12999.561s">[Bears]</a>: We're doing it now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13000.542s">[Bears]</a>: It's starting to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13001.542s">[Bears]</a>: I agree with Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13003.644s">[Bears]</a>: I don't agree with some of the legal proceedings that happened around 40Bs, but it's not the wholesome question here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13010.348s">[Bears]</a>: Last thing I'll say, you started out with the teacher's compensation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13014.141s">[Bears]</a>: Having talked to our teachers, having heard from our teachers union, our paraprofessionals union in this space and in the school committee, I know they don't feel like their compensation is sufficient and competitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13022.946s">[Bears]</a>: I know many of them feel pressure to leave for other districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13026.388s">[Bears]</a>: And I also know when it comes to benefits that there's been ongoing negotiation issues around the healthcare benefit for all of our employees, police, fire, DPW, city hall and the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13036.494s">[Bears]</a>: So just wanted to put that perspective out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13039.816s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13042.534s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13044.195s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13045.476s">[Bears]</a>: One minute for one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13089.281s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you for the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13090.001s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone want to go for it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13213.621s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13213.981s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13319.545s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13319.745s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13321.065s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Zaro, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13407.123s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13408.604s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Lemming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13588.611s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks, Danielle, I'm going to put on my two minutes here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13592.294s">[Bears]</a>: And just say, a when we were discussing this, the reason that I support this is that I believe a debt exclusion is the best mechanism to fund the construction of a new fire headquarters in the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13602.978s">[Bears]</a>: When we're having the conversations, we have had some of the discussions that we've had over the last two months since the question came out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13610.103s">[Bears]</a>: As you've noted, we weren't involved deeply in the planning process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13613.325s">[Bears]</a>: There was an OPM that said, this is going to be the estimated cost of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13618.268s">[Bears]</a>: Here's this number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13619.809s">[Bears]</a>: And when we looked at the capital spending for the next five or 10 years, that's the biggest item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13624.292s">[Bears]</a>: Sorry, I have a cold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13625.873s">[Bears]</a>: I have something in my mouth, so it sounded a little funky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13631.052s">[Bears]</a>: That is my rationale here, that this is the best way to fund a new headquarters in a timely manner and get it built.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13637.455s">[Bears]</a>: I tend to agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13638.796s">[Bears]</a>: I've read some of the stuff that has been put online when we're talking about the phased red, yellow, green, getting people out of that red zone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13647.487s">[Bears]</a>: when we're talking about the arrangement on that second floor of the rooms and the showers and not being enough showers and bathrooms, I do believe that both of those would fall under the DOR regulations around minor project changes because they would be, you know, changes on the, essentially on the floor plan where things are, how many versions of things are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13666.722s">[Bears]</a>: If there's something bigger than that, if we're talking about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13670.423s">[Bears]</a>: that would be something that would have to go further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13675.227s">[Bears]</a>: There are options on that front.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13678.11s">[Bears]</a>: If it is a little bit over the 30 million, if we are talking about 35 instead of 30, you could go out to the bond capacity to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13687.077s">[Bears]</a>: I would certainly be open to those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13688.559s">[Bears]</a>: I have appreciated some of the dialogue that has been out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13690.781s">[Bears]</a>: I agree with councilmember<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13696.055s">[Bears]</a>: the mayor and you, the fire union could get to a better place and be at a more collaborative place and that people would feel like their voices are being heard and included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13705.802s">[Bears]</a>: I don't believe that the plan that's out there right now is the final plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13708.484s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think it will be the final plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13710.045s">[Bears]</a>: I expect that things will be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13712.207s">[Bears]</a>: Um, and I certainly expect that this council, if some of those changes are significant, would be supportive of providing additional funding for those changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13719.112s">[Bears]</a>: So that's my position on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13720.713s">[Bears]</a>: I tend to agree with some of my fellow counselors around the timing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13723.615s">[Bears]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13725.461s">[Bears]</a>: as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13725.902s">[Bears]</a>: You know, we put it in this package because we believe this package is the one thing we're going to have to ask for other than a new high school until we start seeing that new growth be enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13734.61s">[Bears]</a>: So that's where I'm at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13736.232s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13740.436s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13741.458s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks, Danielle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13742.098s">[Bears]</a>: Next question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13742.759s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13744.501s">[Bears]</a>: You have one minute to ask one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13796.324s">[Bears]</a>: I'll go to Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13800.605s">[Bears]</a>: Two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13924.533s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13925.814s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Callahan, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14009.551s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, anyone else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14011.172s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14163.088s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14163.969s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14165.23s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone else here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14165.83s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Levee, two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14289.596s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14292.489s">[Bears]</a>: I'm going to go really quickly here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14294.109s">[Bears]</a>: I think there's some questions around division.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14300.43s">[Bears]</a>: We are at an inflection point as a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14302.631s">[Bears]</a>: The community is changing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14304.811s">[Bears]</a>: We're looking at new growth and development for the first time really seriously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14308.752s">[Bears]</a>: We're talking about decades of deferred maintenance and underinvestment that are coming up now that we need to address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14314.933s">[Bears]</a>: And I understand that paying more is a hard choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14318.894s">[Bears]</a>: I think it's a hard choice for everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14320.034s">[Bears]</a>: I think some people feel<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14321.775s">[Bears]</a>: that it's a choice that they can make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14323.655s">[Bears]</a>: Some people feel like it's a choice that they can't make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14327.296s">[Bears]</a>: But we have difficult decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14329.357s">[Bears]</a>: And one of those difficult decisions is to ask people to pay for the things that the city needs to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14337.258s">[Bears]</a>: It's a very difficult decision frame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14338.559s">[Bears]</a>: We've talked about all the different things that the city needs to pay for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14342.759s">[Bears]</a>: I firmly believe, and my approach has been that the best thing we can do<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14346.241s">[Bears]</a>: is ask the questions, present the information, get the budget out there, and then ask the voters to either elect people to make choices, which is most of the decisions, or even to make the choice themselves, which is what we're talking about with this proposition with questions six, seven, and eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14364.849s">[Bears]</a>: One thing I'll say is I don't call opposition talking points for your tactics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14368.71s">[Bears]</a>: I don't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14370.231s">[Bears]</a>: I don't say the opposition is dividing the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14373.232s">[Bears]</a>: That's just something I don't do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14376.138s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli talks about the meetings that we should all look at to see what's happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14381.839s">[Bears]</a>: I'm pointing to people to those exact same meetings to watch those exact same meetings, because I think if they watch them, they'll see things from the perspective that I experienced those meetings from, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14391.262s">[Bears]</a>: At the end of the day, we're not perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14394.563s">[Bears]</a>: Sometimes things get divisive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14396.143s">[Bears]</a>: Sometimes certainly I react here or when I sat down there in a way that I'm not happy about, that's a little more divisive or a little more pointed than I wanted it to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14405.314s">[Bears]</a>: And I try to do better every time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14407.275s">[Bears]</a>: I try to learn from those issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14409.795s">[Bears]</a>: And I think at the end of the day, there will always be outstanding questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14413.737s">[Bears]</a>: There will always be a process that could have been longer, that could have been better, that the rules could have been looked at differently, that people could have had more time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14422.86s">[Bears]</a>: And I think you have to balance that against the priorities and the time that we need to make a choice, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14428.341s">[Bears]</a>: We could have a process for 10 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14431.458s">[Bears]</a>: And there's still be people with outstanding questions who aren't happy with the end of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14435.601s">[Bears]</a>: And at the end of the day, I think that's what democracy is about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14437.863s">[Bears]</a>: This has been a four-hour discussion of major tensions that people have, answering questions, trying to get to a point of agreement and stay in respectful dialogue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14446.63s">[Bears]</a>: And I think that's the best that we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14449.592s">[Bears]</a>: And at the end of the day, the voters will decide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14451.313s">[Bears]</a>: The voters will decide on November 5th if these questions are approved or denied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14455.236s">[Bears]</a>: The voters will decide next November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14457.489s">[Bears]</a>: serves on this council, who serves as the mayor, who serves as the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14461.191s">[Bears]</a>: And that's democracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14462.852s">[Bears]</a>: We aren't all going to agree with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14464.573s">[Bears]</a>: I've been on the losing end of quite a few votes in this room myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14468.115s">[Bears]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14599.435s">[Bears]</a>: I think the question is about why the property value is going up faster than the median or the average that the assessor presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14607.017s">[Bears]</a>: The assessor presented that just for this year, the estimated median single family tax bill would increase 195 year on year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14614.0s">[Bears]</a>: So that's, I'm just looking at the slide he presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14617.441s">[Bears]</a>: It was just for this change from fiscal 24 to fiscal 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14622.23s">[Bears]</a>: I think, quite frankly, a lot of those questions we'd have to talk to the assessor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14625.413s">[Bears]</a>: I'd be happy to try to set up a meeting with the three of us or the two of us if you don't want me involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14643.81s">[Bears]</a>: That surprises me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14686.314s">[Bears]</a>: I can't speak to what the state laws are around assessment and how they come up with their formulas, but I'd be happy to try to set up a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14693.3s">[Bears]</a>: I would love that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14694.181s">[Bears]</a>: We've gone extensively over on the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14696.003s">[Bears]</a>: I do want to give other counselors a chance if any other counselors want two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14730.831s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14731.372s">[Bears]</a>: I will coordinate, get the contact information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14733.734s">[Bears]</a>: We can try to set up a meeting around the specific questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14736.557s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14739.48s">[Bears]</a>: Just realizing I would have asked Larry to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14741.583s">[Bears]</a>: So another sad thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14745.567s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone else on this question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14747.729s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, we'll go to the podium to our former chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14750.693s">[Bears]</a>: One minute for one question, chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14982.807s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14983.608s">[Bears]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14984.268s">[Bears]</a>: You want to go if I can first chief, we didn't have an opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15344.016s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15417.751s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15418.331s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15419.451s">[Bears]</a>: I'll just speak for myself to say I appreciate your service to the city, coming down here tonight, laying out this case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15426.493s">[Bears]</a>: A lot of what you've talked about has been coming out drips and drabs over the past couple of months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15433.515s">[Bears]</a>: To me, to an extent, as best as I can say it, I think we are conflating two pieces of a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15442.079s">[Bears]</a>: There's the question of the design and the design process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15444.72s">[Bears]</a>: From everything I've heard, it's not adequate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15447.281s">[Bears]</a>: We're not at a final design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15448.301s">[Bears]</a>: The final design needs to be improved, 100%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15451.582s">[Bears]</a>: As I've read through letter from Danielle, things online, things like the clean zones and the space, and especially I know I've had some conversations with Todd Blake and the interim chief around how the design was changed relative to the MassDOT Mystic Ave Main Street project and how that's impacted things like turn radius and the apparatus bays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15472.048s">[Bears]</a>: I have a lot of significant concerns about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15474.509s">[Bears]</a>: I still believe a debt exclusion is the best way to fund the fire station headquarters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15478.93s">[Bears]</a>: Now, if 30 million is only funding 75, 85, 95% of that, A, it's not just 30 million, it's 30 million plus inflationary adjustments and minor project changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15491.053s">[Bears]</a>: So that 30 million bond could really be 32 to 35.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15493.293s">[Bears]</a>: If the changes can be made within that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15496.454s">[Bears]</a>: then this debt exclusion continues to pay for the fire station headquarters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15499.936s">[Bears]</a>: If it's more than that, you've said a number 40, 45 million, you think, potentially, I'm 100% in to say we need to look at the bond capacity or we need to ask again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15510.393s">[Bears]</a>: for more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15511.213s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think that voting no on this debt exclusion will get us to eventually a yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15516.515s">[Bears]</a>: That's my position on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15518.216s">[Bears]</a>: I think voting yes to the financing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15536.563s">[Bears]</a>: And I didn't mean to put words in your mouth that you're advocating for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15539.484s">[Bears]</a>: My personal position is voting yes funds most of this project, the way that I think it can best be funded, the fastest way it can be funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15547.745s">[Bears]</a>: I didn't have all this information when we released the plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15551.026s">[Bears]</a>: Do I wish that people had acted differently so it would be easier to talk to the residents and get them to support things like this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15560.748s">[Bears]</a>: As you're aware, as other folks here are aware, there are things that are not within<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15564.827s">[Bears]</a>: this council's control within my control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15571.658s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15609.125s">[Bears]</a>: I personally agree that the communication needs to be better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15611.407s">[Bears]</a>: It needs to be more of a seat at the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15613.668s">[Bears]</a>: I'm still going to vote the way I'm going to vote, because I think it gets us a lot of the way there on the financing question, even if I personally have a lot of problems and issues with the design and the design process as it stands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15622.234s">[Bears]</a>: So that's just where I'm at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15624.716s">[Bears]</a>: And I appreciate you coming down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15626.637s">[Bears]</a>: And yeah, I think the other thing we've talked about a lot tonight is that the state is not doing us right in a lot of ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15631.241s">[Bears]</a>: That includes MassDOT and DCR on our streets and roads in general.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15634.443s">[Bears]</a>: And you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15636.431s">[Bears]</a>: they get to say, well, we're not going to spend the 6 million to redesign your intersection if you don't do it our way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15640.973s">[Bears]</a>: And we don't really have a lot of recourse, even though I wish we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15644.695s">[Bears]</a>: So it's a tough situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15662.685s">[Bears]</a>: So if you've got a ramp that's 60,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15681.577s">[Bears]</a>: It sounds like a lot of heads need to get together before a final design happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15687.181s">[Bears]</a>: Anything else on this question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15688.662s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15690.304s">[Bears]</a>: I think we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15691.325s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15695.196s">[Bears]</a>: We have someone who hasn't asked a question yet, and then we have a hand that has and someone in line that has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15699.477s">[Bears]</a>: So we'll go to the floor, name and address for the record, one minute to answer one question or ask one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15708.98s">[Bears]</a>: It's on, you're good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15709.841s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15710.081s">[Bears]</a>: And you shouldn't need to touch it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15775.03s">[Bears]</a>: I can answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15775.631s">[Bears]</a>: Does anyone else want to go first on this question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15777.631s">[Bears]</a>: I know Councillor Scarpelli and I have been in five tax setting meetings together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15782.234s">[Bears]</a>: I don't know if you want to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15784.116s">[Bears]</a>: All right, residential exemption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15788.139s">[Bears]</a>: It's not the panacea, it seems to be A. There is a breakeven point in the home valuations, where if you implement a residential exemption, if your value is above that, you actually start paying more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15800.988s">[Bears]</a>: So if we implemented a residential exemption, I believe two years ago, that breakeven was almost exactly the average, around 768,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15809.315s">[Bears]</a>: If you're above that value, you actually start paying more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15812.901s">[Bears]</a>: than you did without the exemption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15814.362s">[Bears]</a>: If you're under that value, you pay less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15816.584s">[Bears]</a>: Now, the reason this happens is essentially to do this, A, the council would set it, but it would be in partnership with the assessor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15825.13s">[Bears]</a>: The assessor's office has said they probably need to hire two more full-time staff in that office just to process the applications every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15832.755s">[Bears]</a>: But essentially, you take what is the flat tax rate,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15837.89s">[Bears]</a>: across all residential, your 8.51 per thousand, I think is our FY 24 rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15843.672s">[Bears]</a>: And you create a 30% exemption on the tax of the average home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15850.414s">[Bears]</a>: So 30% of the tax bill for a $768,000 home, that becomes your exemption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15855.016s">[Bears]</a>: That's a fixed dollar amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15856.176s">[Bears]</a>: Let's say for just for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15858.709s">[Bears]</a>: efficiency sake, let's say that's $3,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15861.551s">[Bears]</a>: So if your tax bill is, uh, you know, $6,000, you get $3,000 off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15867.877s">[Bears]</a>: Um, but that has to be shifted, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15871.48s">[Bears]</a>: So the city's actual tax doesn't come down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15873.802s">[Bears]</a>: The city still needs to raise all the revenue it's raising every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15876.824s">[Bears]</a>: So that, that fixed dollar about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15879.514s">[Bears]</a>: actually also means that you increase the tax rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15882.238s">[Bears]</a>: So instead of having an 8.51% rate, you might have a 12.5% rate, but then you get the $3,000 off if you're owner occupied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15885.241s">[Bears]</a>: So if you're getting a 30% rate increase,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15895.609s">[Bears]</a>: and you're getting a 30% exemption, if you're in a lower value home, you save money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15899.411s">[Bears]</a>: If you're in a condo, you probably save money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15901.132s">[Bears]</a>: If you're in an under low value single family, you save money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15903.773s">[Bears]</a>: If you're in a multifamily, a high value single family, certainly if you're in a large apartment building, you're actually paying more because the tax rate's going up significantly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15913.345s">[Bears]</a>: to cover for that shift.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15915.826s">[Bears]</a>: So essentially, it benefits some people in the community, it benefits people who generally condo owners, people in single families below the breakeven point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15924.948s">[Bears]</a>: And it actually would result in increased taxes for people who have very high valued single family homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15931.65s">[Bears]</a>: Most multifamily homes are over 750,000 valuation apartment buildings are so we could implement it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15939.435s">[Bears]</a>: We would need six months to a year to do so before a tax rate hearing, which happens in December.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15944.258s">[Bears]</a>: So we'd probably need to make a decision by April or May of the prior year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15948.905s">[Bears]</a>: The assessor's office was ready to be budgeted to hire more staff to process the applications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15953.588s">[Bears]</a>: And at the end of the day, it doesn't, it's not a panacea for everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15957.991s">[Bears]</a>: I tend to support it anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15959.812s">[Bears]</a>: I think it turns a flat rate wealth tax into a progressive rate wealth tax, where the rate is actually lower on lower wealth properties and higher on higher wealth properties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15970.618s">[Bears]</a>: But it doesn't help everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15973.22s">[Bears]</a>: It doesn't mean, if you're a senior and you're above the break even, you might pay more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15977.141s">[Bears]</a>: So it's not, it doesn't help everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15980.482s">[Bears]</a>: It certainly is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15982.282s">[Bears]</a>: We consider it and discuss it every December.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15984.102s">[Bears]</a>: We basically have the conversation I just tried to summarize at our tax rate setting hearings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15990.663s">[Bears]</a>: And I know there's been different perspectives on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15992.244s">[Bears]</a>: I've been a supporter because I generally tend to think that having that progressive rate system is a better approach than the flat rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15998.985s">[Bears]</a>: But similarly, I've heard arguments from my colleagues, Councilor Caraballo, Councilor Knight, who are not on the council, but they were,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16005.56s">[Bears]</a>: concerned about what if you're in a home value above the breakeven point and that's about basically about half of people who are owning properties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16013.303s">[Bears]</a>: So I think it goes either way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16017.244s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16020.245s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16021.626s">[Bears]</a>: Any other stuff on the residential exemption?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16026.107s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16027.067s">[Bears]</a>: Can you wait?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16027.708s">[Bears]</a>: Can you wait?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16031.169s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16033.587s">[Bears]</a>: We are now, I think no one, has anyone who has, hold on one second, Andy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16037.752s">[Bears]</a>: I'll make a brief though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16038.733s">[Bears]</a>: Just one second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16040.075s">[Bears]</a>: Has anyone not asked a question who wants to ask a question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16045.06s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, we'll go to public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16046.922s">[Bears]</a>: I'll take Andy, then I'll take Gaston for a second question, then we have Micah on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16051.3s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Castaneda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16137.056s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Andy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16139.178s">[Bears]</a>: Gaston, either a question or a comment, and I'm gonna go up to two minutes for everybody for this last little section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16280.563s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Gaston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16282.364s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone else on that comment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16289.397s">[Bears]</a>: I just wanna note myself, and this is just me being an economics nerd, and I'm really sorry to do this at 10 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16295.96s">[Bears]</a>: I like to use the PCE price deflator for state and local government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16301.563s">[Bears]</a>: It's line 24 on the BEA table of the GDP price deflators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16306.446s">[Bears]</a>: And if you look at that, it tells a little bit of a different story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16308.767s">[Bears]</a>: Even when PCE for like the average person was 4%, for example, in 2021, for state and local government, it was 6.7.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16314.89s">[Bears]</a>: In 2021, it was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16319.694s">[Bears]</a>: 7.1, 2022 for PCE, generally it's 8.0 for state and local.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16324.136s">[Bears]</a>: State and local price inflators tend to be higher than the PCE.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16329.158s">[Bears]</a>: It's PCE, but it's just PCE broken down for state and local.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16331.979s">[Bears]</a>: It tends to be higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16333.88s">[Bears]</a>: I appreciate your comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16335.02s">[Bears]</a>: I agree that the new growth element is a factor here, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16338.182s">[Bears]</a>: And I think Matt was saying over the last, since 1980, I can't remember the fact, it's not 2.5% that we've averaged, it's 3.1 or something like that because of the new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16347.455s">[Bears]</a>: In the last couple of years, the new growth is significantly higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16349.796s">[Bears]</a>: So I think we're at like four, but we're also talking about 4% when we're looking at a cost increase of eight, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16357.198s">[Bears]</a>: So it's still running behind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16370.681s">[Bears]</a>: Someone put out a great chart where it was showing the real,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16374.765s">[Bears]</a>: a nominal dollar increase and then it also had a graph of the inflation adjusted real dollar increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16380.246s">[Bears]</a>: And I think personally we're catching up for 2020 to 2023 here with this override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16396.515s">[Bears]</a>: And to me, now we're going back and forth, and this is just because I- We're already gutting up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16400.236s">[Bears]</a>: I enjoy this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16400.956s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, I think this override catches us up to where we need to be, where the new growth, it fits to me what I'm seeing as this is the one time we're going to have to ask for this outside of the high school, because the new growth will get us there in five to 10 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16413.779s">[Bears]</a>: And this catches us up from the inflation adjustments that we need over the past few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16419.34s">[Bears]</a>: So, thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16423.1s">[Bears]</a>: I like arguing about PC with people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16426.38s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Zoom, and then we'll go to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16429.223s">[Bears]</a>: Zoom, I have Mike name and address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16431.425s">[Bears]</a>: Second question, you have two minutes if you want to ask a question and make a comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16657.548s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16659.63s">[Bears]</a>: Any further comments on that comment or question from members of the council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16662.954s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, we'll go to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16665.136s">[Bears]</a>: Our esteemed election commissioner and former school committee member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16808.046s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think we're going to go back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16809.027s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think we're going to go direct on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16856.74s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16858.701s">[Bears]</a>: Council Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16899.111s">[Bears]</a>: We do have a number of items on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=373.803s">[Bears]</a>: Larry loved, lived, and breathed Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=375.785s">[Bears]</a>: He loved City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=377.006s">[Bears]</a>: He loved his job as city messenger, and he loved working with this council and his colleagues in the clerk's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=381.929s">[Bears]</a>: He was a calming and steady presence at council meetings, and he provided wise counsel to anyone who sought his advice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=387.274s">[Bears]</a>: We offer our deepest and most sincere condolences to Larry's family, to his friends, and to all who loved him, be it further resolved that the Medford City Council dedicate tonight's meeting in Larry's memory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1080.525s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1085.222s">[Bears]</a>: from Medford Community Media, Kevin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1090.185s">[Bears]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1093.428s">[Bears]</a>: We can hear you, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1188.949s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Kevin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1190.969s">[Bears]</a>: I have some words from former President Morrell here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1195.171s">[Bears]</a>: She was hoping to be here, but I think in fitting for Larry, we had a long night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1201.472s">[Bears]</a>: She says, I want to send my deepest condolences to Larry's family, to thank them for sharing Larry with the city all these years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1207.947s">[Bears]</a>: who's an incredible steward of the city council and the chambers and was so dedicated to his role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1211.749s">[Bears]</a>: He'll be truly missed both as an individual and for all he brought to this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1218.574s">[Bears]</a>: And I get the difficult task of going last, but Larry once said to me, so long as you're not throwing chairs at each other, it's a good night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1231.482s">[Bears]</a>: Because I think he saw someone almost throw a chair at someone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1234.994s">[Bears]</a>: maybe this side to this side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1236.094s">[Bears]</a>: I think anyone who's only sat on this side has missed out sitting over here and seeing Larry's face and being able to make that eye contact with him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1248.1s">[Bears]</a>: And sitting up here too, it's been interesting the first few months of this term, but I didn't get to know Larry as well as I wanted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1253.482s">[Bears]</a>: I've known him for five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1254.683s">[Bears]</a>: The first few years were the pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1257.564s">[Bears]</a>: We were on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1259.165s">[Bears]</a>: Larry's still coming to my house every day, every Friday, bringing the papers and whatnot, but didn't get<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1265.123s">[Bears]</a>: uh, really to get to know him until we were back here and we were able to talk more before and after meetings during expected and unexpected recesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1274.889s">[Bears]</a>: Um, but I always like to think of it kind of how counselor Scarpelli did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1279.272s">[Bears]</a>: If you were hearing words of encouragement from Larry, he didn't have a great day, but he, he presented it in a nice way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1285.916s">[Bears]</a>: If you're having words of respect from Larry, you had a decent day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1290.018s">[Bears]</a>: He did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1290.298s">[Bears]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1291.039s">[Bears]</a>: And if you had words of pride from Larry, you had a really good day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1293.977s">[Bears]</a>: And I was lucky enough to experience all three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1297.28s">[Bears]</a>: I probably have a warped sense in my mind that may be more pride than encouragement, but it was really just helpful to be able to talk to Larry about just have all that knowledge, decades of knowledge of this body and these meetings, to talk to someone with a different perspective on a lot of issues, but then find a lot of common ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1322.319s">[Bears]</a>: And I know that he will be missed by this body, by the former members, by a lot of people in City Hall and certainly by his family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1330.041s">[Bears]</a>: He was just a really wonderful, kind, caring person who I really enjoyed spending time with in the limited ways that I was able to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1339.784s">[Bears]</a>: And I know there are a lot of people who got to enjoy a lot more time with Larry who aren't going to be able to share that time with him anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1346.466s">[Bears]</a>: So I'm thinking of them because if I feel this way, I can only imagine how they feel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1352.093s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1356.815s">[Bears]</a>: The motion of everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1358.336s">[Bears]</a>: Oh, we have some people to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1360.217s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, public participation will take you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1551.171s">[Bears]</a>: We don't, but we'll share it and the clerk's office will make it available and we'll get it around when we know more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1556.155s">[Bears]</a>: And we're trying to also make sure that the city provides as many honors as we can provide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1566.649s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Andy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1567.289s">[Bears]</a>: Is there someone who can make Zack Bares and Andy Castaneda and George Scarpelli all cry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1572.871s">[Bears]</a>: That's a good guy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1587.357s">[Bears]</a>: Bobby, do you want to say anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=3138.757s">[Bears]</a>: I have to abstain because Councilor Scarpelli offered me a cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=3314.367s">[Bears]</a>: Motion passes, meeting is adjourned, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2934.266s">[Bears]</a>: So two years ago, a little past that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2939.127s">[Bears]</a>: We had a little bit of a disagreement, I would say, the mayor and I, over the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2945.77s">[Bears]</a>: And, you know, and I think it's important to sort of like, just be straight up, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2950.251s">[Bears]</a>: Council had some serious questions about the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2953.172s">[Bears]</a>: We wanted to talk about an improved budget process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2955.373s">[Bears]</a>: We wanted to talk about the underfunding issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2957.254s">[Bears]</a>: Council Vice President Collins and I were, had identified the need, the significant underfunding and the excuse of what type of funds to fund operating expenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2967.698s">[Bears]</a>: And that budget went to the last, I think, 2 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2972.023s">[Bears]</a>: meeting, the Mayor came out, and at the end of it, we made some improvements to the budget, and we talked about what we'd do the following year, and that budget actually passed, I think, unanimously, or at least the Councilor and I next to me voted for it at the end of the night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2987.81s">[Bears]</a>: The next year we came back and we took a bit of a different approach, really focusing on what would a better budget process for the city look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2995.755s">[Bears]</a>: And what ended up happening, the council collectively again unanimously put forward a set of budget requests, budget demands in a sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3007.262s">[Bears]</a>: President Morrell at the time, Nicole Morrell and I went and met with the mayor and we sat down and we said, here's what the council wants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3012.386s">[Bears]</a>: We want a better budget process, we want more funding for our schools, we want more funding for our library.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3017.691s">[Bears]</a>: And what we were able to negotiate on behalf of the council as council leadership with the mayor was three things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3024.156s">[Bears]</a>: The formation of a financial task force,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3026.431s">[Bears]</a>: consisting of the leadership of the school committee, the city council, and the mayor, the commitment to establish a new budget process through a budget ordinance, which we passed this year and used in this year's budget, starting the process earlier than ever in the most transparent way possible, and the commitment to really address this issue of underfunding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3045.023s">[Bears]</a>: And that's what the financial task force did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3047.764s">[Bears]</a>: We've released, again, multiple press releases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3050.006s">[Bears]</a>: We announced it at the budget time last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3052.067s">[Bears]</a>: We announced the formation of the task force, and then we announced<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3453.725s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3459.911s">[Bears]</a>: And I think the Mayor can speak to it too, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3461.992s">[Bears]</a>: Just to get to this budget, we basically didn't do $3 million worth of looking at the Mayor for it, because she did approximately $3 million worth of stuff that we wanted to start doing this year about that on the city side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3474.818s">[Bears]</a>: So, when you talk about having enough people to make sure that city government is performing its basic services,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3483.746s">[Bears]</a>: just another impact if it doesn't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3485.387s">[Bears]</a>: You know, we're talking, I think you guys mentioned it before, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3488.51s">[Bears]</a>: Not only would we likely have to cut many of the things that are funded by one-time funds, but there certainly would not be an opportunity for the city to add a staff member in a key office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3498.137s">[Bears]</a>: That's where it's currently needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3499.799s">[Bears]</a>: The other thing I just want to say, going quickly back to the grant side of things, grants are 99% of the time one-time or short-term funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3507.505s">[Bears]</a>: Whether it's one year, two years, or three years, eventually the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3512.517s">[Bears]</a>: It's not a sustainable way to fund a permanent operating budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3515.598s">[Bears]</a>: The reason we're talking about an override and talking about property taxes is because it is a permanent revenue source to fund ongoing expenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3525.421s">[Bears]</a>: And the great sad impact of Proposition 2.5 was that sustainable revenue went away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3531.964s">[Bears]</a>: You know, DPW 40 years ago had twice as many people working here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3537.043s">[Bears]</a>: Now we're talking about just having people to work there to fill potholes, because we don't even have that anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3542.664s">[Bears]</a>: And I think that's a legacy both of the Proposition 2.5 law and 45 years of not being willing to say to the voters, yeah, this is hard, but we need to ask us to come together and fund these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3555.608s">[Bears]</a>: Otherwise, they're not going to get done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3557.428s">[Bears]</a>: And as Dana mentioned, then it just snowballs and gets worse and worse and worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3992.25s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks, and I just want to make kind of two points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3995.211s">[Bears]</a>: I think what the mayor said about there are things that are not set in stone and need to be tweaked, I think that's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4000.192s">[Bears]</a>: I think we've heard from some folks that there are tweaks that they would like to see made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4006.213s">[Bears]</a>: I think this question of the clean zones and the phasing for folks, firefighters coming back from a firefighter, from a fire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4015.775s">[Bears]</a>: Some questions around showers and bunk space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4018.195s">[Bears]</a>: But there's two things here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4019.838s">[Bears]</a>: Voting yes on question six is about voting yes on a five and six mechanism, not a final design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4025.046s">[Bears]</a>: The State Department of Revenue has very clear guidelines that say minor project changes, inflationary adjustments due to construction and timing can adjust the size of the bond slightly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4035.788s">[Bears]</a>: It's not gonna jump from a $30 million bond to a $40 million bond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4039.209s">[Bears]</a>: It's not gonna happen, but it might be from 30 to 31 or 32 if there are minor project changes that need to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4046.43s">[Bears]</a>: So my hope is, as the mayor noted, there's a concept design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4050.151s">[Bears]</a>: It's not a final design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4051.735s">[Bears]</a>: There's been statements at the Council Q&A last week from firefighters around things that they would like to see different, and I think we can vote yes on the financing mechanism, and my hope would be that as the design moves from a concept design to a final design, those project changes can happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4211.264s">[Bears]</a>: The mayor mentioned earlier the exemptions available through the assessor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4217.298s">[Bears]</a>: They are the maximum exemptions allowed by state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4220.719s">[Bears]</a>: Only state representatives and state senators can increase them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4224.38s">[Bears]</a>: The council and the mayor's office have been really intentional about maximizing, making sure that we're doing the most that the state allows us to do, and then tying our own exemptions to the state law so that if it ever goes up, Medford's go up automatically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4238.185s">[Bears]</a>: There's been some talk that seniors could be exempted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4241.527s">[Bears]</a>: There's nothing in the Proposition 2 1⁄2 law that allows that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4244.349s">[Bears]</a>: It just doesn't exist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4246.27s">[Bears]</a>: It's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4248.051s">[Bears]</a>: So it's a difficult situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4251.052s">[Bears]</a>: We are doing, as a city, the most that the state law allows us to do to try to protect all the people that the state law allows us to protect through exemptions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4260.057s">[Bears]</a>: We have the deferral program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4261.698s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, there's 5% interest on the deferral program, but again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4266.961s">[Bears]</a>: that is what the state law allows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4268.803s">[Bears]</a>: I think we maybe could reduce that to as low as 2%, something we could look at 4%, so we're at 5 and you go down to 4, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4277.449s">[Bears]</a>: We could look at that, but we'd still have to talk to assessing, you know, and what would the impact of that be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4282.193s">[Bears]</a>: There's the work-off program, but again, I think Anna's point<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4288.274s">[Bears]</a>: is incredibly restrictive about what it allows municipalities to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4291.917s">[Bears]</a>: I wish we had a very different local tax system that could much more target and direct the impact and who's paying what taxes, but we have a flat property tax with limited exemptions, and that's what the state wants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4935.443s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I think just to add to what Jenny said, you can also just not make decisions, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4941.186s">[Bears]</a>: And I think that's the other thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4942.767s">[Bears]</a>: Camps have been kicked out of the road for decades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4945.769s">[Bears]</a>: Some good things have happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4946.99s">[Bears]</a>: There have been projects that have founded the norm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4951.432s">[Bears]</a>: I think the new schools project is one of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4954.614s">[Bears]</a>: But most basic maintenance, basic staffing, fixing 100<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4966.65s">[Bears]</a>: Having enough staff to do the basic job of what a city needs to do has basically just not happened, and now that has created a massive debt that is coming due.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4978.539s">[Bears]</a>: It is a difficult inflection point, and it sounds like the library is closing soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4984.544s">[Bears]</a>: But there's another thing right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4986.245s">[Bears]</a>: Our library is not open on Sundays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4987.546s">[Bears]</a>: Most libraries are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4988.807s">[Bears]</a>: Our library closes early on Saturdays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4993.493s">[Bears]</a>: You can find every department, every single thing that the city does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4997.654s">[Bears]</a>: It's generally a little less than most other places because we don't have the funds to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=928.8s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam President, Madam Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=933.462s">[Bears]</a>: Again, I think we need to talk about what the process actually was in the RFP, which discussed us having specific public meetings around specific proposals for specific neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=945.248s">[Bears]</a>: This is a public meeting on the Mystic App proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=950.45s">[Bears]</a>: We can talk about the process that got us here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=953.191s">[Bears]</a>: Again, robust, extensive, comprehensive planning over two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=957.017s">[Bears]</a>: feedback from thousands of residents, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=960.74s">[Bears]</a>: When you read the RFP, when you read the contract that was awarded, we talked about holding public process and public meetings throughout on specific proposals for specific areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=971.489s">[Bears]</a>: We've had multiple meetings to generate this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=973.931s">[Bears]</a>: We're now having a meeting on the final draft proposal coming out of committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=978.374s">[Bears]</a>: It goes to council for automatic referral to Community Development Board, where there'll be another public hearing on this proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=987.0s">[Bears]</a>: a community meeting, whatever we want to call it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=991.204s">[Bears]</a>: There's public meetings ahead on this proposal specific to Mystic Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=996.669s">[Bears]</a>: And that's the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=998.03s">[Bears]</a>: So we are having the public meetings and engaging the residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1002.629s">[Bears]</a>: on these proposals based on the two plus years of public engagement and community engagement that's already happened to develop the city comprehensive plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1011.894s">[Bears]</a>: We're now executing on literally years of community process and engagement around this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1017.657s">[Bears]</a>: We've heard from residents around Mystic Avenue multiple times on proposals and on the ideas of what was in the comprehensive plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1026.202s">[Bears]</a>: And now we have a draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1027.963s">[Bears]</a>: This public meeting is occurring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1029.824s">[Bears]</a>: There will be the meeting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1031.792s">[Bears]</a>: to refer this to the Community Development Board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1033.593s">[Bears]</a>: The Community Development Board will have a public hearing and at every step along the way, community members will be engaged and are being engaged in that process and will have continued voice even beyond the voice that's already been part of this process to inform this plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1048.925s">[Bears]</a>: So I don't know specifically what the request is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1054.309s">[Bears]</a>: If it is to have a public meeting,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1060.509s">[Bears]</a>: That's happening and has happened and will continue to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2002.948s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Madam Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2004.289s">[Bears]</a>: I was just wondering,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2006.688s">[Bears]</a>: Paula, in the memo, you noted that we need a little more study on like what the community solar incentive would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2014.715s">[Bears]</a>: Are we thinking that that would be something that the research could be done like, well, this is being also at the public meetings for the Community Development Board and could maybe be included as a recommendation from the CD board or at the final council hearing on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2031.55s">[Bears]</a>: Or do we need more time than that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2152.716s">[Bears]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2153.016s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2462.403s">[Bears]</a>: about how we communicate this process, and I mean this for all stakeholders here and those who have been part of this so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2473.814s">[Bears]</a>: We are doing a comprehensive update to the zoning ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2477.497s">[Bears]</a>: We're breaking that into pieces, as was discussed in the RFP, as was discussed in our first 13 meeting of this committee on this topic so far, because we want<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2489.133s">[Bears]</a>: the public to be able to access the different pieces of the project as we move along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2494.035s">[Bears]</a>: But instead of saying, I mean, we could have met, you know, 25, 30, 40 times, and then had a document at the end of it, you know, and had a 200 page document that here's the new zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2504.619s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think anyone would have really been able to understand that in the way that this process is working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2510.141s">[Bears]</a>: So that's why I think we just need to be really clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2512.182s">[Bears]</a>: And I think we need to tighten up a little bit how we're communicating this out, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2520.35s">[Bears]</a>: each of these stages as part of this comprehensive zoning update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2524.072s">[Bears]</a>: Right now we're working on the Mystic Avenue Corridor District.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2528.155s">[Bears]</a>: That is the district boundaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2531.497s">[Bears]</a>: What uses do we want in that area?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2533.358s">[Bears]</a>: How does that align with the comprehensive plan and all the public participation up to this point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2538.061s">[Bears]</a>: The goal of this committee, and I think we need to maybe really put out a very specific calendar and probably work through this together in our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2550.247s">[Bears]</a>: meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2550.407s">[Bears]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2550.487s">[Bears]</a>: Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2550.727s">[Bears]</a>: You know, our steering meetings here of the goal was to have essentially two meetings a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2558.051s">[Bears]</a>: Where one meeting was discussing districts and one meeting was discussing global changes like what director Hunt said around parking, and I think we need to put out a calendar going forward that says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2569.756s">[Bears]</a>: Here's the district that we're working on this month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2576.55s">[Bears]</a>: here's the global change that we're working on this month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2578.791s">[Bears]</a>: Here's the date and the time of that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2580.931s">[Bears]</a>: And, you know, the, and just really like lock that in and lock that down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2585.992s">[Bears]</a>: I understand we need to have some flexibility as questions come up, but, um, I think putting that out is going to just behoove all of us to a, keep us on track, keep us on plan, but also to make sure that, um, folks feel communicated to about this and,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2606.235s">[Bears]</a>: So I just really think we should probably sit down in our next meeting and say, OK, November, we're finishing up the Salem Street corridor district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2616.701s">[Bears]</a>: That's what we've already talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2618.441s">[Bears]</a>: We're looking at this set of global plans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2620.803s">[Bears]</a>: I think we're doing that in memos.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2622.083s">[Bears]</a>: And I think like those of us who are maybe like in this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2625.774s">[Bears]</a>: and especially those who are in the steering part of the process understand what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2629.737s">[Bears]</a>: I just don't think we're like putting that out in a communications way really effectively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2634.039s">[Bears]</a>: So I just wanna think about how we can do that where we move forward from here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2642.965s">[Bears]</a>: And also, I just wanna note, like, I appreciate that we can, you know, look at further studies and look at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2652.958s">[Bears]</a>: finding more grants for more studies and things like that, and I think that that's useful in some cases, but I think the goal of this process as outlined in the RFP is to do the comprehensive rezoning of the entire zoning ordinance and to rezone the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2666.944s">[Bears]</a>: And if there are studies that need to go longer than that, then I think we should think about that in the way that Director Hunt and Vice President Collins were just talking about, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2679.11s">[Bears]</a>: We can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2680.111s">[Bears]</a>: implement this change now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2682.412s">[Bears]</a>: And if there's a study where we're not going to get the grant funding for a year, we can come back and further fine tune that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2688.055s">[Bears]</a>: But I just want to make sure that we keep moving along this plan so that at the end of this process, we have that comprehensive zoning update that matches the goals and action items from the comprehensive plan<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2703.262s">[Bears]</a>: And then that's the thing that can then be further updated, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2706.524s">[Bears]</a>: I think that's the base document for the city planning for the next 20 to 30 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2712.086s">[Bears]</a>: And then we'll have those additional studies and long-term pieces of things that will further inform tweaks and changes down the road as market conditions change or new industries pop up or whatever it may be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2725.451s">[Bears]</a>: But I just think there's like a little bit of communications work<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2729.15s">[Bears]</a>: that we can be doing that would go a long way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2731.112s">[Bears]</a>: And so I hope that we can work on that going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2818.814s">[Bears]</a>: And even more so, I think it's actually less granular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2820.955s">[Bears]</a>: I think we've done that, but it's like a slide in a presentation or a paragraph or a section in a memo<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2827.922s">[Bears]</a>: And I think, you know, I'm just thinking of like how people access information and, you know, if someone doesn't open the memo or watch the meeting or see the presentation, it's really more of a presentation question to me than anything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2840.566s">[Bears]</a>: Like, how do we take that information that we've already kind of discussed and put out a little more formally and turn what is a slide in a presentation into a flyer, something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3051.417s">[Bears]</a>: took us on a bit of a tangent there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3053.038s">[Bears]</a>: I appreciate everybody going through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3055.759s">[Bears]</a>: I did have one question going back to the development standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3063.142s">[Bears]</a>: I know that we're hoping, or the plan is that at the end, there's kind of a realignment of the development standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3071.165s">[Bears]</a>: And that probably coincides with the catching of like the artifacts and other quirks that end up<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3082.492s">[Bears]</a>: happening because of the way that we're doing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3086.354s">[Bears]</a>: Would the intent of that be that there would be like a development standard section that's outside of the corridor specific sections and what basically would there then just be like a development standard section and then it would have the corridor separate breakdowns within them or just could we go a little bit more into that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3109.848s">[Bears]</a>: Just want to clarify that for myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3179.974s">[Bears]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3180.295s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3180.695s">[Bears]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4285.472s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I just wanted to say thanks, Martha, and I wanted to know what you just noted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4290.873s">[Bears]</a>: Chair Collins, which is that, you know, the most recent, I mean, I think there's a few language changes that aren't yet up on the Civic Clerk website, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4300.778s">[Bears]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4300.898s">[Bears]</a>: Draft as a Friday on the map as a Friday are up at, um, our council agenda portal and attached his files there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4308.882s">[Bears]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4310.783s">[Bears]</a>: And appreciate the comment about flexibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4314.065s">[Bears]</a>: Um, it looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4316.366s">[Bears]</a>: The C two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4318.027s">[Bears]</a>: The zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4320.748s">[Bears]</a>: I think it actually a but a commercial and an auto<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4328.914s">[Bears]</a>: In Somerville, and then about so residential, but I think it's worth certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4333.476s">[Bears]</a>: As this moves through the planning board, if they want to take a look at that, the community development board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4337.517s">[Bears]</a>: Um, if there's something we could do there, but that math inspection site, and then the used auto shop immediately to it's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4346.08s">[Bears]</a>: East those are actually in Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4349.341s">[Bears]</a>: Um, and it looks like there's, I can't quite read the summerville map right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4353.783s">[Bears]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4355.362s">[Bears]</a>: or I can't quite tell exactly what they put there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4357.203s">[Bears]</a>: It looks like it might be a mid-rise three district, because I have seen those very narrow, very thin housing units, which I've always been interested in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4365.847s">[Bears]</a>: It seems like a great way to use an interesting lot for affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4371.05s">[Bears]</a>: But there are actually auto uses on the Somerville side as well, abutting that C2 on Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4466.374s">[Bears]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4467.094s">[Bears]</a>: I also have a minor amendment<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4477.359s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, just a slight language amendment to move to refer the draft Mystic Avenue zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4485.022s">[Bears]</a>: Quarter district proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4487.363s">[Bears]</a>: To the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4489.524s">[Bears]</a>: Next regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4491.225s">[Bears]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4492.145s">[Bears]</a>: So just be clear that it's the missing Avenue<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4518.722s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4519.323s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4538.78s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1036.567s">[Bears]</a>: 20th regular meeting Medford City Council October 2024 Mr. Clerk, please call the roll Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1068.689s">[Bears]</a>: announcements, accolades, remembrances, reports, and records.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1074.317s">[Bears]</a>: 24480, offered by President Behrs, resolution to thank two DPW staff members for an act of kindness and their dedicated service to Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1083.106s">[Bears]</a>: Whereas on Saturday, October 5th, quick thinking by DPW employees, Jeff Gangy and Anthony Pompeo helped return a lost wallet to Robert Bohannon, an 82 year old disabled veteran.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1093.091s">[Bears]</a>: And whereas Mr. Bohannon was deeply thankful to have the wallet returned, both because it was designed by his late brother and because the cards and information would have taken months to replace, describing the act, quote, as quote, as close to a miracle as we have experienced and,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1106.857s">[Bears]</a>: Whereas Mr. Bohannon and his wife wanted to express their gratitude and, quote, do something for these really thoughtful employees while noting that, quote, they wouldn't take anything and including his letter with the words, quote, we love Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1117.506s">[Bears]</a>: Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we thank Jeff Genge and Anthony Pompeo from our DPW for their dedicated service to the city of Medford and honor their active service and kindness that was described as Mr. Bohannon as, quote, the best of many great moments I've experienced in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1134.875s">[Bears]</a>: For me, we just got a really, really kind email and I felt like it was worth saying thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1139.32s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone want to say anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1140.081s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1174.807s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, is there a motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1175.887s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion to approve by Vice President Khan, seconded by Councilor Seng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1181.069s">[Bears]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1182.65s">[Bears]</a>: Opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1187.792s">[Bears]</a>: Records, the records of the meeting of October 15th, 2024, yes, were passed to Councilor Seng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1192.554s">[Bears]</a>: Councilor Seng, how did you find those records?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1196.455s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion of Councilor Seng to approve, seconded by Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1199.396s">[Bears]</a>: Mr. Clerk, you don't have to call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1201.337s">[Bears]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1202.677s">[Bears]</a>: Opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1203.418s">[Bears]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1207.068s">[Bears]</a>: reports of committees 24475 offered by council President bears committee of the whole October 15 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1214.93s">[Bears]</a>: This was the question and answer session that we held October 15 regarding the proposed override and debt exclusion ballot questions that are on the ballot on November 5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1227.092s">[Bears]</a>: And just a point of note, as regards to the voting Councilor Scarpelli raised to me the point of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1232.566s">[Bears]</a>: the letting people know if you're coming in, we're seeing a lot of early voting, a lot of mail voting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1237.528s">[Bears]</a>: And just a reminder to everyone, when you early vote or you mail vote, your ballot is put into a sealed envelope and that envelope is opened on election day and counted on election day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1247.892s">[Bears]</a>: So if you're expecting it to run through the machine on the early voter, the mail vote, that's not how the state law around elections work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1255.57s">[Bears]</a>: So those envelopes will be opened by the elections department staff on election day and then will be run through the machines on election day, along with all the ballots of everyone who votes on election day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1266.542s">[Bears]</a>: Councillor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1284.863s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councillor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1475.186s">[Bears]</a>: We have here October 23rd, 2024 petition to the Honorable City Council, Councilors, the undersigned respectfully pray for discussion of the well-used parking lot adjacent to the Medford Senior Center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1486.695s">[Bears]</a>: So recognize Marion and we will go from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1494.431s">[Bears]</a>: Let me give you one second to turn on your microphone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1720.041s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you to the members of the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1722.762s">[Bears]</a>: Does anyone like to respond before we go to members of the public?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1725.683s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1727.184s">[Bears]</a>: And I do have a response from the planning department as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1734.567s">[Bears]</a>: Would you rather go first?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1735.827s">[Bears]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1736.848s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1740.748s">[Bears]</a>: and then we'll go to, I'm gonna read the response, we'll go to councilors, then we'll go to the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1746.572s">[Bears]</a>: I have here to Council President Behrs and honorable members of the council regarding the public participation petition respectfully submitted for your honorable body's consideration as additional information about activities concerning the municipally owned parking lot at 75 Riverside Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1765.144s">[Bears]</a>: Clippership pop-up as of October 9th, the corner of the parking lot has been repurposed to create<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1773.453s">[Bears]</a>: Oh, sorry, repurpose to create the clipper ship pop up park, the pop up is utilized by the city, particularly the recreation department for periodic programming and is otherwise open for passive recreation to the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1786.946s">[Bears]</a>: To create the pop-up park, no parking spaces were lost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1789.489s">[Bears]</a>: The pop-up area was created from what was a previously redundant drive aisle and six parking spots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1795.715s">[Bears]</a>: To prevent any loss of parking, eight new parking spots were re-striped in the parking lot, resulting in a net positive for parking spaces overall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1803.903s">[Bears]</a>: Please see photos below demonstrating locations of eight new parking spaces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1810.123s">[Bears]</a>: Request for proposals Medford Square, the city published an RFP request for proposal for three underutilized parcels behind City Hall on September 30th, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1820.511s">[Bears]</a>: The city wants to garner interest from developers to explore what redevelopment options there would be for these three combined parcels, including mixed use buildings, affordable housing and parking structures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1831.279s">[Bears]</a>: The city will enter a long-term ground lease for up to 99 years with a qualified developer for these parcels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1837.383s">[Bears]</a>: The due date for responses is December 20th, 2024 at 1 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1842.026s">[Bears]</a>: Community outreach for this project was conducted through focus groups and community meetings through the Transforming the Square project in partnership with Metropolitan Area Planning Council in 2023.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1852.071s">[Bears]</a>: MAPC conducted research using previous plans and site visits of the square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1855.933s">[Bears]</a>: Please note that parking for our seniors is a top priority for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1859.675s">[Bears]</a>: The mayor explicitly mentioned this in her greeting to developers before the walkthrough last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1866.451s">[Bears]</a>: Construction employee parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1868.174s">[Bears]</a>: Due to the large-scale construction project at 121 Riverside Avenue, the adjacent Clippership lot has seen an influx of commercial and personal vehicle parking to accommodate workers and staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1878.757s">[Bears]</a>: As a result of this temporary parking situation, the mayor contacted Medford Housing Authority Director Jeffrey Driscoll to get a more complete breakdown of what vehicles are occupying spaces during the day, how long this disruption is anticipated and how a compromise can be reached to alleviate community concerns and allow accessibility to the worksite.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1897.464s">[Bears]</a>: The mayor concluded that there were up to an additional 40 cars due to the lot construction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1902.285s">[Bears]</a>: Director Driscoll has been receptive and helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1904.386s">[Bears]</a>: He reached out to the contractor for support<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1907.04s">[Bears]</a>: Jim Silva, Special Project Coordinator, also visited the lot earlier last week and requested that the workers use the lower City Hall lot instead so that seniors had spots when visiting the Senior Center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1917.272s">[Bears]</a>: It is a work in progress to get the construction workers to relocate, but we are doing everything possible as parking for our seniors is our priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1923.939s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1926.922s">[Bears]</a>: And I'll recognize Councilor Scarbelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2166.323s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2167.387s">[Bears]</a>: Any further comments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2169.233s">[Bears]</a>: Council Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2234.44s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2235.4s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Councilor Zaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2316.202s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2359.915s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2360.335s">[Bears]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2360.655s">[Bears]</a>: And just procedurally, um, the next steps as far as I understand it, the memo mentioned that responses will be due December 20th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2369.618s">[Bears]</a>: I believe then the planning department would come to this body to request our approval to authorize a land lease.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2375.68s">[Bears]</a>: So there would be further public meetings regarding the proposal, and it would require a vote of the council to authorize the city to lease the land.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2383.917s">[Bears]</a>: No, I'm just saying that that's the next steps for the RFP, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2388.759s">[Bears]</a>: But we will go to comments and everyone will have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2392.181s">[Bears]</a>: Give me one second as I figure out our new microphone system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2399.724s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2449.281s">[Bears]</a>: name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2450.322s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2597.416s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2599.117s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2792.383s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2792.843s">[Bears]</a>: I can speak to the process that the planning department is working on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2797.986s">[Bears]</a>: I spoke with the planning director, Alicia Hunt, and she was at the Chamber of Commerce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2804.01s">[Bears]</a>: I think last week they had a day where all the businesses in the square could meet with her and kind of have conversations about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2811.294s">[Bears]</a>: That includes the current chair is the Chevalier manager, Andrew Mather, and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2819.539s">[Bears]</a>: So that was something that happened, and I know that she relayed to me that there was a lot of excitement, but they did want to be engaged specifically around this question of parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2827.602s">[Bears]</a>: And one of the things that they were looking at, and I don't know if it's going to happen as part of this project, and it really depends on the proposals that come in from the people who are proposing, was seeing if the parking garage that is attached to Atrius Health could be redeveloped to be a more public parking garage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2847.548s">[Bears]</a>: so that during the day it could be used by the health folks and at night potentially be used for other uses, because right now it's closed at night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2856.712s">[Bears]</a>: But I don't think that would be the only answer, but that was just an idea that I had heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2861.895s">[Bears]</a>: In any case, there was a meeting with the Chamber of Commerce specifically about these RFPs with the businesses in the square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2868.898s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2874.909s">[Bears]</a>: Does anyone else want to speak on the topic Councillor saying, Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2982.91s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2984.19s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion on this public participation petition?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2988.892s">[Bears]</a>: Councillor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3012.845s">[Bears]</a>: I need your name and address for the record to start off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3017.168s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3104.148s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3104.549s">[Bears]</a>: Go to Councilor Callahan, then we'll go back to the microphone for public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3462.992s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3463.392s">[Bears]</a>: I do want to just make a point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3465.094s">[Bears]</a>: I don't disagree with what you said and engaging people is really important, but I just want to be clear that going to the RFP was not the first thing as part of this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3474.743s">[Bears]</a>: This process references the 2017 Medford Square plan under Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3479.988s">[Bears]</a>: There was a 2019 evaluation of development potential under Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3483.671s">[Bears]</a>: the 2022 housing plan and the 2022 draft comprehensive plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3487.232s">[Bears]</a>: And there were multiple community meetings last year before the drafting of this RFP, including two at the senior center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3494.214s">[Bears]</a>: So, you know, that work has happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3496.475s">[Bears]</a>: Maybe not everyone went to every meeting, but when we talk about what happened, I just think that should be noted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3503.397s">[Bears]</a>: There was two public meetings at the senior center talking about this project and the transforming the square initiative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3564.569s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3565.07s">[Bears]</a>: And I certainly don't disagree with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3567.151s">[Bears]</a>: I do know that the office worked with the senior center to get the word out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3571.522s">[Bears]</a>: And I am hopeful, again, we heard from Dan Kennedy recently online about a city newspaper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3577.027s">[Bears]</a>: We need that level of information and resource, but there have been meetings and we do do as much outreach as we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3585.414s">[Bears]</a>: And that doesn't always reach everyone, even when we try to reach everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3588.437s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Councillor Singh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3672.987s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3673.667s">[Bears]</a>: I'll go to the podium, name and address for the record, and you'll have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3705.901s">[Bears]</a>: In terms of the Colleen's behind there, that's not part of the scope of the request for proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3763.459s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address the record, you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3850.669s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, so we don't have the proposals yet, but the request for proposals document says that parking is a priority and that the senior center parking needs to be replaced in full no matter what develops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3862.474s">[Bears]</a>: But the specific proposals such as height, et cetera, hasn't come out yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3866.276s">[Bears]</a>: And that won't be out until after December 20th, which is the deadline for the proposals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3942.484s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3944.387s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion on this subject counselor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4056.088s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, I would just note.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4058.681s">[Bears]</a>: that we did receive that they were well attended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4061.502s">[Bears]</a>: We could probably get more information about that to share with folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4065.664s">[Bears]</a>: And I believe there are recordings available online as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4069.006s">[Bears]</a>: But it does tend to be as part of the planning process that you spend a the time to do the comprehensive plan, then you spend the time to do the community outreach, and then you put together the proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4077.71s">[Bears]</a>: And then again, right, like, that's not the end of the public process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4081.391s">[Bears]</a>: So it's a multi year multi stage planning process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4083.892s">[Bears]</a>: But<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4085.973s">[Bears]</a>: We're having a conversation right now, and people can come to any council meeting and talk about it, but we also will have further public meetings and public hearings as the process goes forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4150.94s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion on this item?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4157.472s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, we'll move to general public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4159.553s">[Bears]</a>: Public participation on any topic not on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4165.495s">[Bears]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4182.783s">[Bears]</a>: I saw him just the other day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4288.273s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion or anyone who'd like to participate in public participation on any item that's not on the agenda for the rest of the evening?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4299.881s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, is there a motion on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4303.965s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4308.789s">[Bears]</a>: On the motion of Vice President Collins to revert to the regular order of business, seconded by Councilor Sang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4313.033s">[Bears]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4314.614s">[Bears]</a>: Opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4315.235s">[Bears]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4318.554s">[Bears]</a>: 24484, resolution to adopt local options of HERO Act, whereas Governor Healey recently signed into law an act honoring, empowering, and recognizing our service members and veterans, also known as the HERO Act, Chapter 178 of the Acts of 2024, to increase benefits, modernize services, and promote inclusivity for veterans in Massachusetts, and whereas the HERO Act allows local option in which cities may tie property tax exemptions and veteran-specific exemptions to the Consumer Price Index<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4347.436s">[Bears]</a>: allowing for automatic year-to-year increases in these exemptions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4350.679s">[Bears]</a>: Now therefore be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the City of Medford accept General Law, Chapter 59, Section 5, Clause 22i, which authorizes an annual increase in the amount of the exemption granted under General Law, Chapter 59, Section 5, Clause 22, 22a, 22b, 22c, 22e, and 22f,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4370.317s">[Bears]</a>: by the percentage increase in the U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4371.798s">[Bears]</a>: Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index for the previous year as determined by the Department of Revenue to be effective for the applicable exemptions granted for any fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2025, and be it further resolved that the City of Medford accept the General Laws Chapter 59, Section 5, Clause 22J, which authorizes an annual increase in the amount of the exemption granted under General Laws Chapter 59, Section 5, Clauses 22,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4400.237s">[Bears]</a>: 22A, 22B, 22C, 22E, and 22F by up to 100% of the personal exemption amount subject to the conditions in Clause 22J to be effective for applicable exemptions granted for any fiscal year beginning on or after July 1st, 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4414.69s">[Bears]</a>: And we do have attached here the memo from the Division of Local Services of the State Department of Revenue regarding the HERO Act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4425.147s">[Bears]</a>: and I believe Councilor Lemming has also discussed this with the assessor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4429.289s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Councilor Lemming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4540.403s">[Bears]</a>: That was what he on the motion of Councilor lemming to refer this paper for legal review seconded by Councilor Kelly and is there any further discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4589.42s">[Bears]</a>: Go to Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4646.79s">[Bears]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4648.351s">[Bears]</a>: I'll go back to Councilor Lemming in just a second, but I was on some of the email chains and we can get that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4653.752s">[Bears]</a>: Ted has already said he doesn't expect it to be a significant impact on the overlay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4658.353s">[Bears]</a>: And yeah, but I'll go to Councilor Lemming, he had more of the conversations than I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4689.462s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you Councilor Megan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4691.103s">[Bears]</a>: I mean, I would note DLS literally gave us sample language here and that's the language we're using.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4697.968s">[Bears]</a>: I personally don't think this needs to go to KP for however long they're going to take on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4708.836s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4710.497s">[Bears]</a>: It's really written, but if we want to just get a letter from the assessor and then we can take it up in two weeks or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4715.861s">[Bears]</a>: And if KP can get us something in two weeks,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4719.892s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4721.553s">[Bears]</a>: So I think that would mean that would be a motion to table till the next regular meeting and request a memo from the assessor and legal if they can provide one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4737.919s">[Bears]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4739.02s">[Bears]</a>: On that motion by Councilor Lemming, seconded by Councilor Sang, all those in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4745.823s">[Bears]</a>: All those opposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4747.398s">[Bears]</a>: Motion passes and this is tabled to the next regular meeting pending those requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4754.043s">[Bears]</a>: And Councilor Lemming if you could just ping Ted, and maybe Nina for KP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4763.731s">[Bears]</a>: And the clerk can coordinate with you on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4765.292s">[Bears]</a>: 24489 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5053.075s">[Bears]</a>: Anyone would like to comment on the item?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5058.079s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, Chief, if you would like to speak, you're more than welcome to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5063.283s">[Bears]</a>: It's your call, and then we can go to members of the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5084.506s">[Bears]</a>: I believe the request is for the report for the consultant to be released.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5193.447s">[Bears]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5193.967s">[Bears]</a>: Is this an amendment to the resolution to request?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5197.729s">[Bears]</a>: It says here right now, consultants attend the next city council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5201.151s">[Bears]</a>: Do we want to change that to a future council meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5252.921s">[Bears]</a>: Any further discussion by members of the council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5254.642s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5258.165s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5269.654s">[Bears]</a>: We can take people at the podium or on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5278.732s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing no hands on zoom and no one at the podium in the chamber on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli as amended by Councilor Scarpelli seconded by seconded by Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5289.328s">[Bears]</a>: All those in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5290.029s">[Bears]</a>: Opposed motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5295.662s">[Bears]</a>: 24490 offered by President bears and Vice President Collins amendment to the zoning ordinance mystic Avenue quarter district for full to the Community Development Board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5303.385s">[Bears]</a>: This memorandum contains draft text for the following proposed zoning changes, amend section 94 dash 2.1 division into districts page two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5311.821s">[Bears]</a>: Amend and section 94 dash 3.2 table of use regulations table a dimensional standards page three, and then section 94 dash 4.1 table of dimensional requirements table be page nine, amend section 94 dash 12.0 definitions page 10 and insert section 94 dash nine dot x mystic Avenue quarter district page 12.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5335.26s">[Bears]</a>: And I will go to Vice President Collins in just a second but just to say, this has been discussed I think we've had 13 committee meetings on the zoning updates project and the planning and permitting committee meet in planning and permitting committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5347.388s">[Bears]</a>: This was referred out last week, procedurally the next steps are that we would now refer to the Community Development Board, they will hold a public hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5356.533s">[Bears]</a>: then they will refer it back with amendments or without to the City Council where the City Council will hold a public hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5364.078s">[Bears]</a>: And at that public hearing, the City Council would vote to adopt finally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5368.14s">[Bears]</a>: So there are two more public hearings on this proposal and I will go to Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5600.501s">[Bears]</a>: on the motion to refer to community development by Vice President Collins seconded by Councilor Lemming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5605.287s">[Bears]</a>: We'll have further discussion I'll go to Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5897.932s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5898.573s">[Bears]</a>: I just want to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5900.074s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think any proposal for 12 stories on Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5906.368s">[Bears]</a>: it's I think it's I know I just I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5910.029s">[Bears]</a>: I just want to put it out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5911.489s">[Bears]</a>: You know, if anyone is thinking that that is not been discussed at all, um, it would be, I think, significantly out of scope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5920.351s">[Bears]</a>: I do have the innest proposal that we accepted here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5924.252s">[Bears]</a>: Um, and project deliverables number two meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5928.272s">[Bears]</a>: This phase includes the meetings throughout the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5931.453s">[Bears]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5932.373s">[Bears]</a>: And there's meetings city staff monthly for the length of the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5937.236s">[Bears]</a>: City Council 10 to 15 throughout the three phases updates the Community Development Board one in each phases one and 22 and phase three public workshops to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5947.637s">[Bears]</a>: steering committee, six to eight stakeholder interviews, 12 to 15, four to five per phasers targeted to phases one and three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5956.082s">[Bears]</a>: So that is what the proposal was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5959.984s">[Bears]</a>: And I do know that NS Associates and planning department have done a lot of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5965.527s">[Bears]</a>: one to one discussions with folks in different neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5970.669s">[Bears]</a>: And I think something that we've discussed, as we discussed in the committee meeting last week, is trying to just be more clear and direct and use more of the city resources that are available to say, and our goal is to do this a month in advance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5986.055s">[Bears]</a>: Here's the meeting at which we will be talking about this specific area, and to try to use the city resources of the robocall system, as well as the different newsletters and digital outreach to inform people in each neighborhood, an area about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6003.69s">[Bears]</a>: the limited technological capability of us to hold public meetings in a hybrid fashion anywhere except for this room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6010.955s">[Bears]</a>: That has been a limiting factor, but we do want to get that out there in advance of each specific area of discussion so that folks can say, I live in this neighborhood, here's the meeting about my neighborhood, I can voice my input at that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6075.108s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6075.528s">[Bears]</a>: I'll go to Councilor Sang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6473.658s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Zaro, Councilor Kellyanne.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6540.537s">[Bears]</a>: That's a good point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6542.557s">[Bears]</a>: That may be a typo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6548.188s">[Bears]</a>: We should just note that for Innis and the planning department as it moves through planning development, community development board, they can correct that and send it back to us amended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6587.057s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, and I will note, basically,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6589.887s">[Bears]</a>: We haven't won one of these districts before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6591.387s">[Bears]</a>: I don't think as a council, this council, Community Development Board will refer back an amended proposal to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6598.388s">[Bears]</a>: We could then make amendments at the public hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6601.869s">[Bears]</a>: If we feel we can either, we don't have to accept all the Community Development Board amendments, we can make additional amendments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6607.87s">[Bears]</a>: I'm just trying to look at the map from our last meeting, but I'll go to Councilor Collins, if you're finished.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6619.235s">[Bears]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6891.98s">[Bears]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6892.461s">[Bears]</a>: Yeah, and I'd note that question resource I know someone who was just hired as the communications director for the parking department in Cambridge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6900.892s">[Bears]</a>: So, it's not to communication search for the city it's like one person per department which is wild level of resources that I would<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6909.56s">[Bears]</a>: love to see the city have just one note, the difference between MX one and MX two is the step backs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6918.047s">[Bears]</a>: So that's why there would be a change in the massing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6921.209s">[Bears]</a>: I was just looking at the map.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6922.19s">[Bears]</a>: That was a helpful reference point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6923.911s">[Bears]</a>: It is still maximum six in the MX two, but the step back is different versus the MX one on the motion of vice president Collins, seconded by council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6933.939s">[Bears]</a>: Let me to refer this amendment to the community development board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6937.162s">[Bears]</a>: Is there any further discussion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6940.737s">[Bears]</a>: Seeing none, is there any discussion by members of the public?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6943.318s">[Bears]</a>: You can raise your hand on Zoom or come to the podium in the chamber.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6950.699s">[Bears]</a>: We'll go to Melanie Tringali.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6952.98s">[Bears]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6954.58s">[Bears]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7011.614s">[Bears]</a>: Yes, a lot of those are based on the existing use table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7034.677s">[Bears]</a>: But most of this, basically anything that's not a new use, which I think is highlighted in bold, is essentially following the special permit currently in the use table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8039.571s">[Bears]</a>: It's like a pile of grass now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8059.304s">[Bears]</a>: I know as a member of the MMA's Public Works Committee, Mass Municipal Association, we talk often about the cost of remediating and removing soil.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8203.457s">[Bears]</a>: I'm guessing this has something to do with when I walked in here and there was broken glass after a windstorm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8331.929s">[Bears]</a>: heat issue and make sure that we're keeping heat and cool air in the chamber.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8335.672s">[Bears]</a>: I know that's a huge problem as well with these windows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8355.575s">[Bears]</a>: because of the historical status of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8358.437s">[Bears]</a>: And these are the original windows, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8365.804s">[Bears]</a>: So they're about 85 years old or so.<br><br>
