 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=8601.484s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Beers. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=8602.684s">Andrew</a> Castaneda, Cushman Street, East Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=8607.767s">First</a> of all, I want to apologize if my phone blew up with a phone call at the start of the meeting over an hour ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=8616.212s">It</a> was one of our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=8618.893s">She</a> was very irate and yelling at me because <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=8622.237s">Channel</a> 22 Comcast was not coming through for this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=8626.278s">So</a> hopefully it got rectified, because I did not want to interrupt your meeting an hour ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=8631.8s">I</a> tried to knock on the door, it was locked, no response. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=8635.921s">So</a> hopefully it's working for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=8639.783s">As</a> far as Salem Street goes, I'll make it very, very brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=8650.885s">because</a> I'm repeating myself from last five meetings on the same subject, Salem Street is congested enough as is. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=8661.207s">My</a> uncle had three family with a store attached to it, still there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=8666.188s">And</a> it's congested in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=8671.609s">If</a> you can do anything is get that large gas station out of the three of them that takes up the whole block around Otter Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=8678.21s">If</a> you can get that, <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=8680.284s">from</a> the owner who lives in Winchester to give it up or Eminent Domain there, that's a nice big parcel, it's a whole block. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=8688.907s">That</a> would be tremendous. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=8690.828s">But</a> otherwise, I wouldn't do too much more because it's already gonna be like Somerville with the Somerville congestion and the issues with or without heroin or methadone. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=8706.733s">Go</a> easy on Salem Street, please.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=12777.128s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=12778.008s">Castanetti,</a> Cushion Street, East Mayfair, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=12782.069s">There's</a> a lot of stuff going on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=12785.03s">I</a> wouldn't want to age off all the tea in China. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=12789.647s">Crazy.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=12792.028s">I</a> guess the old adage is true, you cannot satisfy all the people, especially at one particular time. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=12799.21s">But</a> anyways, first, I should probably congratulations to you councillors on the re-election. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=12811.193s">I</a> hope it was a good and fair election. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=12815.074s">Number</a> two, also special thanks to all the <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=12819.685s">politician</a> wannabes who ran. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=12822.626s">Keep</a> the faith because our country needs you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=12825.246s">Number</a> three, charter review also passed with term limits, but it would be better still if we term limited the Congress and the Senate and more in Washington, D.C., in our opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=12841.729s">Was</a> this meeting scheduled for Tuesday night, last night on the 11th originally?
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=12849.527s">It</a> was originally originally way back. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=12852.568s">Yeah,</a> it was changed because of Veterans Day six months ago.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=12857.15s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=12858.11s">So</a> anyways, I wanted to say happy Veterans Night after. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=12863.592s">Because</a> it wasn't for our veterans from World War Two, we'd be speaking German here if we'd be alive at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=12871.095s">Maybe</a> Japanese on the West Coast, or maybe Spanish, up to the man based in Dixon line. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=12877.537s">The</a> veterans <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=12879.773s">They're</a> not respected enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=12882.975s">They</a> tried to throw me in Vietnam back in 68. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=12885.277s">I've</a> seen my friends come back in body bags from Haines Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=12890.3s">Another</a> one coming back missing an arm and a leg. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=12893.202s">We</a> saw around Mr. Marcelino, Barry Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=12898.225s">And</a> it's just horrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=12900.106s">Imagine</a> if you walked a half mile in their shoes, what they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=12904.669s">They're</a> not respected enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=12907.472s">So</a> a thank you is not good enough, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=12910.314s">A</a> heartfelt prayer is what I like to say to these soldiers. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=12916.518s">Please</a> hear my prayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=12919.059s">Almighty</a> God, creator of heaven, earth, all sentient beings, and more, please get me and all of us to be and do the best that we can, now, always, forever and ever, in our quest for eternal, blissful peace. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=12932.007s">Amen.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=12932.548s">God</a> help them, wherever they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=12936.115s">And</a> hooray, I think I've seen some holiday lights coming back from the VFW of Veterans Party on Sunday night along the footbridge in the Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=12945.803s">Hooray.</a> <h2><a href="../2025-10-28_Y4wcHicGmic/2025-10-28_Y4wcHicGmic.html">City Council 10-28-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=2255.144s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Bears, appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=2260.747s">I</a> am very much dismayed and shocked if Salem Street is going to relax their zoning to a point that, as I stated many times before, it's already congested and it's going to become like Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=2277.69s">And</a> we're going to have the summable hassles along with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=2281.551s">In</a> my opinion, the only best place is Mystic Avenue for development. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=2287.533s">End</a> of story.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=2568.739s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=2571.001s">I've</a> neglected to say that Salem Street is very, very congested as is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=2577.408s">I</a> live <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=2578.955s">one</a> block away. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=2580.376s">I</a> avoid that and go through the square because it's easier to deal with Medford Square than it is with Salem Street at times. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=2590.303s">And</a> don't forget, we on the east side of Route 93 have been suffering with the noise pollution 24 hours a day, which really hurts at three o'clock in the morning when you have a motorcycle revving up <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=2607.737s">It's</a> not fun, and the pollution is not good either. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=2611.899s">Even</a> the people that say, oh, the noise doesn't bother me, but I have to wash my boat at the Riverside Yacht Club on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=2620.423s">It's</a> like insult to injury. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=2624.064s">For</a> 65 years, they've been suffering since they built Route 93 in 1960. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=2630.027s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=4472.03s">Castagnetti,</a> Andrew, Cushman Street, East Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=4476.333s">I</a> just have one question for these two individual department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=4482.717s">What</a> was our new growth value last year, and what is it projected to be this year?
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=4526.703s">With</a> the extra million dollars new growth this year, can for a change, can we eliminate the prop two and a half increase and use this new growth to offset our increases?
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=5018.763s">I</a> just wanted to chime in on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=5020.884s">Going</a> hungry is no fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=5022.185s">And</a> it seems like one in five Massachusetts residents are getting whatever they call it, snap, eight, food cards. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=5031.091s">And</a> it's not fun, especially if they're used to getting the food. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=5036.815s">However,</a> if I'm not mistaken, didn't the governor Haley come up with a billion dollars somehow to help with these hotels, with the immigration situation? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=5049.027s">I</a> would think if she can come up with a billion dollars, maybe she could do something for all the 351 cities and towns.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=5075.373s">No,</a> this is...
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=5087.116s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=5089.717s">I</a> have a question that's very unusual. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=5097.962s">First,</a> your Prop 2.5 double override that we passed <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=5103.875s">costs</a> me about $1,000 extra on my real estate tax bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=5107.577s">Now</a> I'm pushing up to $10,000 on a year real estate tax bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=5112.58s">And</a> that doesn't take into account the $1,000 extra from the increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=5118.564s">It</a> is going to be a 2.5% added thanks to Barbara Anderson. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=5122.827s">It</a> won't be any more unless we do another override. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=5127.049s">But</a> that's going to be in perpetuity along with the $9,000 I'm already paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=5134.012s">Some</a> of us are having trouble paying our real estate tax bills, especially our seniors on a fixed income. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=5141.278s">My</a> question is, if you all city councilors are reelected next week, will you please repeal this unfair prop two and a half override and help all the method real estate taxpayers? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=5157.43s">Yes,</a> no or no comments.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=5165.329s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=5165.509s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=5167.231s">Now,</a> number two. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=5172.455s">I</a> also have a question for Mr. Beers and another Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=5178.58s">What</a> the heck happened with my $100 check I gave to you in the city to install the memorial lights on the Mystic River footbridge? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=5189.43s">Are</a> you gonna give it to the mayor?
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=5192.697s">And</a> there's no lights, it's over a year now.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=5200.759s">It's</a> a lousy hundred foot of lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=5204.36s">And</a> one of the Councilors checked on the internet and a dollar light that would cover a hundred lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=5210.321s">And</a> it should face the Craddock Bridge, the first bridge in North America built in 1638. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=5221.604s">it</a> will look wicked pisser, and it will be glowing on the mystic river. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=5228.206s">It's</a> so sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=5231.567s">I</a> would say, may the good Lord shine a light for all method people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4wcHicGmic&t=5235.668s">It's</a> a memorial, living and deceased, amen.<h2><a href="../2025-10-21_sAkPmqbndfk/2025-10-21_sAkPmqbndfk.html">City Council 10-21-25</a></h2>

<a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4982.568s">We</a> also need real estate tax savings. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4986.451s">Somerville</a> owner-occupied homeowners saved $4,053 last year with a cap break of, a breakeven cap of $2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5001.76s">And</a> Malden saved <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5008.289s">$2,690.04</a> with a cap break even of at one and a quarter million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5022.241s">These</a> numbers are not fake. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5025.704s">These</a> numbers I got from both city hall assessors in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5032.309s">I</a> will leave with you these assessor <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5038.65s">City</a> reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5040.971s">There</a> they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5043.892s">I</a> will leave you with the reports from the assessors and these reports with you to trust and but verify the numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5059.396s">P.S.,</a> in the last 10 years, these owner-occupied homeowners in Malden and Somerville saved an average of <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5069.794s">$2,600</a> per year in the last 10-year average. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5076.559s">My</a> translation means we MedFed owner-occupied homeowners have lost out on a $26,000 savings in the last 10 years on average. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5091.469s">And</a> that does not include lost bank and interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5098.476s">Page</a> two. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5102.397s">People</a> say you can't fight city hall, but I had fun trying for 19 years without success on this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5115.579s">This</a> is my 19th time trying to help the average homeowner. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5119.52s">Here</a> comes my 19th nervous breakdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5122.56s">I'm</a> tired. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5125.661s">So</a> now I am asking the homeowners <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5128.604s">in</a> Medford for small donations to hire a real estate tax lawyer and a retired real estate tax assessor. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5138.811s">Andrew</a> Castagnetti, 23 Cushing Street, Medford, Massachusetts, 23. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5152.62s">Here</a> is the packet of information from Malden and Somerville City Assessors. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5162.617s">Somerville</a> started in 1992. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5168.121s">Malden</a> started the owner-occupied-exemption in 2008. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5174.926s">Again,</a> I repeat, City of Malden saved the owner-occupied-exemption peoples that own the houses, that live in the house $2,690 last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5193.3s">And</a> Somerville, as I said, started in 1992, and last year they saved, if they qualified, if they truly lived in the home, doesn't matter if it's a one, two, three, four, five, or six family, because it only applies to their unit, including Senator Kerry, if he's telling the truth about his address, and Beacon Hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5223.874s">That's</a> a lot of cake, man. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5227.336s">And</a> there's other communities, as you know, and it all started in Martha's Vineyard, I believe, or Nantucket, or both, this exemption, because the residents, the working class people that were taking care of the lawns and working in the restaurants that lived there, they couldn't really afford, but they didn't want people around with these mansions like ex-president <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5253.243s">Obama,</a> who don't live there, they're not owner-occupied, and they get tired. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5261.925s">And</a> this is how this law passed, according to what I believe is truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5268.067s">So</a> I think I've said enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5269.368s">If</a> you have any comments or questions, I really would appreciate it.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5279.971s">It's</a> been a long time coming.

 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5418.713s">Can</a> you imagine that the state senators had a hot, for the first time ever, to help the owner occupied to get a break on the real estate tax? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5436.312s">I'm</a> shocked that they did this back in the 90s, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5439.874s">It's</a> amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5441.075s">So</a> besides, the owner-occupied homeowners, they've carried the financial load for more than 100 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5455.545s">That's</a> all I want to say.<h2><a href="../2024-11-20_rk5kVycceTI/2024-11-20_rk5kVycceTI.html">City Council 11-19-24</a></h2>

 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2600.123s">And,</a> you know, this, I mean, I don't wanna push the envelope. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2603.486s">I'm</a> trying to get these heavy duty, well-built Christmas lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2608.53s">They</a> shouldn't cost more than $100. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2609.571s">And</a> what can they afford more than paying for six packages of cigarettes? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2615.116s">That's</a> 16.50 a wack. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2617.338s">So</a> the point is, this is not rocket science. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2620.0s">It's</a> very doable. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2621.622s">And</a> there'll be thousands of people that would appreciate this.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2628.943s">I</a> think it's appropriate that I leave the check with my letter that I hope you forward to the mayor as a council president you meet with him frequently, and it's appropriate that I leave it on the same messages desk.

 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13279.133s">That's</a> good news, not compared to Summerville, but better than last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13284.514s">So</a> five and three, $8 million on top of the 190, without doing an override, we're going to have another $8 million more than last year's by right, without doing anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13298.877s">But</a> still, I guess it's not enough, and you want more? <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13303.238s">That's</a> ouch. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13305.599s">That</a> hurts. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13309.225s">Medford</a> never asked for a prop two and a half override or a debt exclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13316.73s">We</a> are not Winchester. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13318.11s">We</a> don't have deep pockets. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13319.851s">We're</a> a working class town. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13322.013s">God</a> help us forever and ever to pay our bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=13324.974s">Good</a> night and good health.

 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6688.44s">Yeah,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6690.481s">This</a> is not chapter 59, 5C. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6694.892s">This</a> is to make housing much more affordable. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6697.153s">They've</a> done it in New York City for many decades, I'm sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6700.395s">For</a> example, my guesstimation, the price of a million dollar condo here would cost you, if you put zero down, it would cost you a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6712.28s">But</a> if you buy this co-op, it would be probably a third of the million dollar price. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6718.863s">It'd</a> be probably in the ballpark of $300,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6723.015s">That</a> means if you're paying $2,000 rent now and owning nothing but stacks of rent receipts, with the $2,000 rent, that'll allow you to pay 500, 1,000, $2,000, it would allow you to get out of the rental situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6737.661s">You</a> could borrow $400,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6749.943s">with</a> a $2,000 rent payment by giving it to the mortgager. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6755.808s">And</a> you have total rights to your apartment, just like a condominium, you own shares in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6764.235s">It</a> makes sense to me, I'm not sure if they have the apartment co-op ownership around Boston, but it would be like three times less expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6776.994s">you</a> can get out of paying the rent and making the landlords happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6780.297s">I</a> just wanted to bring that up again. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6783.219s">I</a> hope you investigate that.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7355.529s">someone</a> left their trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7356.91s">Listen,</a> I kind of understand in this country, how we could have a housing shortage. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7365.213s">When</a> I was educated in the seventh grade back in the 60s, back at the Lincoln Junior High School, I believe an economics teacher that said to me, this is a democratic republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7377.297s">And</a> it's a capitalistic society. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7382.352s">which</a> runs better than Russia or China, as a matter of fact, from what I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7387.541s">My</a> point is, I was told it's supply and demand. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7393.052s">Well,</a> if we're in such a crisis, what the hell happened? <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7396.714s">How</a> come the developers were not on top of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7399.456s">Or</a> is the government somewhat responsible for discouraging and not encouraging development? <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7407.622s">Maybe</a> lower the linkage while you're at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7409.823s">I</a> don't have the answer because I didn't go to too many colleges, but it doesn't make sense to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7414.306s">And</a> furthermore, you mentioned Chapter 40B. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7418.41s">Now</a> that's a state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7420.031s">The</a> developers can come in if you don't have over 10% affordable or something to that effect, they can come in and circumvent your actually your building codes, et cetera, to a certain degree. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7431.614s">Is</a> it true that we have one, two or three large developments of apartments that are 40 Bs that are tied up in court by the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7441.418s">Is</a> that true?
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7480.182s">And</a> these are how many units approximate? <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7483.504s">Hundreds</a> of apartments?
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7497.551s">Well,</a> something doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7499.193s">Something</a> is rotten at Denmark. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7501.475s">This</a> shouldn't be a shortage. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7503.778s">There</a> might be a shortage of cash with all this hyped up inflation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7507.362s">That</a> I'll agree with. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7509.892s">I</a> don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7510.693s">The</a> life sciences went down the tubes, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7513.374s">That's</a> where they were going to put the illegals, as a matter of fact, in the building that was sold from a Boston retail, where my son worked. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7521.0s">And</a> he's probably stuck with not just that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7523.401s">He</a> made two offers they couldn't refuse behind him, including Santini Iron Works. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7528.765s">And</a> I guess musical chairs is over. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7532.207s">And</a> that's <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7534.534s">That</a> song is done for now.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7549.244s">I</a> think we're in a sad situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7551.166s">I</a> hope leaders can fix this.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8067.007s">Gee,</a> you're cheap.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8070.408s">Yeah,</a> I noticed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8071.988s">Am</a> I off then?
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8075.529s">Thank</a> you, sir.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8083.1s">The</a> Councilor made a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8084.561s">Land</a> is scarce in 02155. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8087.402s">There's</a> plenty of land. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8089.663s">A</a> third of Medford is woods. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8093.185s">That's</a> called Middlesex Falls Reservation by Saltwater Road towards Stoneham and Winchester. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8098.808s">That's</a> over a third of this land mass that's protected. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8104.21s">However,</a> I remember on Mystic Avenue, I lived there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8108.049s">listen</a> to those big trucks going to Boston, because that was the highway to Boston, Route 38. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8112.375s">It's</a> still called Route 38, it's still called Mystic Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8117.041s">But</a> when they built Route 93 in 1960, I remember the eminent domain, these houses over here, <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8125.359s">And</a> I remember making a raft out of telephone poles, about eight of them with two by fours. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8130.26s">And</a> we sailed like Tom Sawyers down the Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8133.441s">When</a> the ocean came up to Medford Square, the Chronic Bridge, my blowtide was not pleasant. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8140.604s">However,</a> when they built 93, they never developed Mystic Ave to its full potential, especially on <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8153.416s">The</a> 93 side, they have huge parcels of land that have buildings mostly, and it goes back, the lots of land go back like 300 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8163.706s">And</a> at 300 feet frontage, it's huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8167.29s">And</a> if I remember my real estate business, there are air rights.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8178.345s">Air</a> rights.

<a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11292.893s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11294.695s">600,000,</a> probably. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11295.396s">900,000,</a> that might happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11298.5s">So</a> the point is, inflation is rampant. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11303.667s">And</a> my mother took care of the two children, and she didn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11309.67s">And</a> he paid it with a rent that says $100 from his brother and $80 a month rent from his brother-in-law who he sponsored to come from Italy, the old fashioned way and get him a job. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11321.878s">And</a> he wanted me to kick in to buy three new heating systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11326.32s">I</a> said, sorry, I'm going to Woodstock, I'm done. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11328.582s">He</a> sold the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11332.78s">40</a> grand you don't want to hear the rest so I'm going to cut that short. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11335.822s">The</a> point is, I gave you people a solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11339.025s">The</a> last meeting, two minutes ago I was here, I guess that's a month ago or more. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11345.809s">And</a> I gave I had the city messenger. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11349.112s">Mr.</a> LaPore give an old New York Post I had from January, and gave it to Councilor kick Carson. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11357.117s">Maybe</a> she can hear and she remembers it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11359.82s">Maybe</a> you can recall. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11360.941s">I</a> don't know if anyone read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11362.722s">It's</a> a solution to the housing problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11365.124s">It's</a> called co-op apartment shares. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11369.008s">Co-op</a> ownership. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11371.05s">They</a> do this in New York big time, probably 30 years ago to make it affordable. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11376.214s">So</a> anyways, I don't know if you people have any information on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11380.089s">If</a> it's done around Boston, has anyone done any homework to find that answer? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11384.911s">If</a> you have a housing problem, you should have checked that out in my humble opinion.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11391.514s">Answers?</a> 
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11449.987s">That's</a> not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11451.228s">He</a> took up some of my time.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11456.178s">Okay,</a> the point is, if you did it, we also, if it makes it more conducive and doable, we have three parcels of city land. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11465.401s">One</a> here, next to 93, one behind you, and one across from the senior citizens, their parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11471.423s">So</a> that might solve a big problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11475.765s">So</a> I would look into it if you have any things to do that's gonna help.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11487.87s">And</a> this is important, Councilor Beards. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11491.372s">I</a> never busted him. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11492.432s">I</a> got it.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11496.274s">Yeah,</a> let me finish my first round.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11501.476s">I</a> understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11502.056s">I'm</a> I'm usually the one is your million dollar Mr. Castagnetti. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11508.419s">Yeah,</a> but let me finish the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11510.7s">The</a> million dollar condo. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11512.8s">Fussy</a> Lansky.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19711.748s">Scott</a> Powell, you get a gag order, it's my turn, quiet. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19718.431s">You</a> get 20 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19719.451s">I</a> know, my wife's been wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19722.693s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19723.053s">Oh,</a> by the way, thank you for, I think you remember.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19729.116s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19731.577s">I</a> wanna thank you very, very much, I appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19734.458s">I</a> like to close off meetings, but I didn't realize it would be the next day. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19738.119s">What</a> time is it?
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19741.299s">I'm</a> sorry, what was the question? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19745.253s">My</a> paper?
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19749.115s">Who's</a> who's talking? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19750.575s">It's</a> Matt. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19751.516s">I</a> thought it was from the movie, 13 Ghosts. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19753.497s">I</a> just watched it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19755.298s">Never</a> mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19756.078s">You</a> wouldn't get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19758.019s">It</a> was 1964. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19760.24s">These</a> papers, I have to get my notes in order because these are my president notes, my cue cards. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19766.222s">They're</a> all shuffled from not speaking before. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19770.144s">That's</a> what they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19770.764s">They're</a> cue cards, presidential ones.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19777.329s">I</a> bet you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19779.469s">So</a> anyways, maybe I can get this done real quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19784.53s">I'll</a> agree affordability is a monumental problem, but it's not my fault, it's not their fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19791.551s">And</a> to make matters much, much worse, three years this week, we've had the most worst rampant inflation in 50 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19802.413s">P.S.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19802.993s">inflation</a> is the most regressive tax of all.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19811.015s">I</a> guess you interrupted me, I mixed up my presidential cut.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19816.139s">All</a> right, so this is, I think it's number two. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19819.302s">Math</a> doesn't lie, but people skew the numbers.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19823.685s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19827.028s">That's</a> great, good memory. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19828.229s">You</a> have a great memory, what did I say?
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19833.173s">And</a> what was below it?
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19843.462s">That's</a> not coming here. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19846.283s">My</a> old man paid 11 five for the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19849.724s">Yeah,</a> he met his $5,000 salary, the call of 50 so he paid triple the salary today you make 100,000 a year, I have no clue. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19857.386s">I</a> never seen that kind of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19859.502s">The</a> same formula would be you could pay only 300,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19861.645s">You</a> ain't gonna find for three, it's gonna be six or 900. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19864.228s">So</a> you're gonna have to put up a heck of a hundreds of thousands and thousands of dollars down payment in order to qualify with the mortgagor. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19874.578s">I</a> gave you a solution a month ago from the New York Post, cooperative shares. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19881.562s">It's</a> like a condo, but you have shares. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19883.604s">It's</a> the same thing, but instead of a million dollar condo in this condo area in Station Landing, you get into it for 300,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19890.769s">Think</a> about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19894.204s">If</a> we take a mortgage for the whole $300,000, no money down, it's $510, $1,500 a month, instead of you paying $2,500 a month rent right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19904.887s">This</a> is a solution.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19909.088s">Oh,</a> you know I had my last one.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19914.349s">I</a> waited until after midnight.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19920.471s">You</a> know, you're a pain.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19925.906s">By</a> the way, the CPA tax, there's a story about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19929.628s">When</a> they started gathering the signatures like five years ago, and one of the girls was Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19934.992s">Cameroon,</a> along with other girls, and they gathered signatures by the hat shell here, and they only needed half the required signatures that you and I, the regular people, would have to acquire in order to put it on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19951.852s">because</a> the state did that, because they liked the tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19954.535s">They</a> allowed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19955.956s">And</a> anyways, that was not fair, because not only that, they put the ballot question on the CPA tax on the back of the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19964.724s">Not</a> very many people turned the ballot over, and it passed by a narrow margin. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19970.249s">That</a> was like unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19973.483s">Also,</a> by the way, I told you about the HO3, car insurance came in yesterday, $2,500 to $3,000.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19983.147s">That's</a> crazy, the house bills are insane. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19986.748s">There's</a> a quote that goes like this, tax the rich, feed the poor, until there are no rich no more. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19993.591s">Tell</a> me where is sanity? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19997.052s">But</a> the point is, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19998.905s">I</a> don't worry about the rich. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=20001.006s">They</a> can only sleep in one house if they have five mansions like the Rolling Stones. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=20004.647s">The</a> point is, it's the middle class you're destroying now. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=20007.368s">No</a> more the lower middle class. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=20008.928s">Now</a> you're going after the middle class. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=20011.609s">Once</a> you do that, we don't have a society worth a damn. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=20014.19s">You</a> might have a Marie Antoinette running on the best deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=20018.371s">That's</a> serious stuff you're talking. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=20020.431s">I'm</a> not blaming you, I'm blaming your government.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=20027.35s">or</a> say middle class. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=20029.251s">Oh</a> yeah one thing Council my uncle said something there's a city council you probably don't know him. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=20034.513s">He</a> just say one thing that I agree with one, and he said leave the people alone and Council March when he retired from this body, you might recollect. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=20043.476s">He</a> says to you, Councils, as he left. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=20047.264s">Go</a> easy on the people, especially his mother probably trying to on a fixed income like me and West method, trying to support herself. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=20054.809s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=20055.249s">So</a> please consider we got to wrap it up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=20057.911s">It's</a> a one paragraph.

 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15237.844s">I</a> believe I understand Councilor Matt's idea here, commercial vacancy tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15244.367s">So</a> the West Bedford Square and other locations can look fuller, like we're all selling on a full apple cart, and it looks better on a retail basis, I presume. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15256.854s">And</a> this may be an extra additional real estate tax, commercial real estate tax, on top of the existing, I presume. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15267.068s">as</a> a sort of penalty to push forward someone to rent it out, and make the city look better. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15273.671s">Nate</a> brought up 398-400 Riverside Avenue, and I believe it was Life Sciences that bought that building a year or two ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15288.578s">My</a> son used to work there in the machining department. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15295.447s">And</a> I'm just guessing that I think the life science industry hit the fan. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15305.851s">And</a> he paid, or the entity paid $29 million, I believe, for that property. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15311.094s">And</a> his last sold, I think, I forget, and previous to that, it was sold for a dollar, probably father to son, I presume. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15318.657s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15319.949s">And</a> I believe the entity bought the building behind it, and also the other building behind that, which was Santini Ironworks. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15328.474s">They've</a> been in business over 100 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15330.775s">They</a> build steel beams to build all these bridges in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15336.179s">But</a> anyways, they're all empty. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15337.94s">Of</a> course, they're not on street level in the front and center. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15345.124s">But</a> what concerns me more than all of this is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15350.458s">And</a> I'm generally going to ask if you have an answer and be willing to answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15357.382s">I'm</a> more concerned if the commercial real estate values are crashing. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15363.845s">That</a> is a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15366.326s">Are</a> they crashing? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15368.167s">Commercial</a> real estate values, are they crashing as we speak?
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15376.699s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15377.779s">Big</a> time, I hope not.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15415.72s">Yes,</a> I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15416.28s">My</a> real estate tax didn't go up prop two and a half style. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15419.561s">It</a> went up like four, $500. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15422.462s">Again.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15423.242s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15424.923s">Every</a> year for the last three years, 400, 400, 400.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15435.506s">Yeah,</a> so what I'm concerned about is for, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15440.114s">17,000</a> real estate taxpayers, if the commercial real estate is going in the dumps, that means the residential real estate is gonna have a huge increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15458.204s">It's</a> gonna rise dramatically, big time. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15461.145s">This</a> happened before, and Mr. McGlynn had this meeting at the McGlynn School. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15467.671s">I</a> said, well, what are you talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15468.531s">Prop</a> two and a half, it should only go up like 50 bucks, a hundred dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15472.394s">He</a> says, Andrew, you had a full house there, high rate residential owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15478.817s">And</a> he says, it's gonna go up, I think it was like $700 instead of the a hundred bucks usually. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15486.342s">So</a> I said, what about prop two and a half, Mr. McGlynn, Mayor? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15490.324s">He</a> says, Andrew, good question. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15491.745s">Because</a> when the commercial real estate values go down, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15496.803s">We're</a> gonna get it big time, maybe two, three, four times more increase than normal, which is already $450 for mine last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15506.148s">That's</a> a scary thought for people with fixed incomes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15510.89s">I</a> don't know if you know about this, if I'm factual, but you might wanna check that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15516.092s">Thank</a> you for listening.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16296.468s">I</a> think this is great that Councilor Bearsley brought this forward because maintenance is key, I've said many times. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16307.754s">And</a> furthermore, the McGlynn School, I'm not sure if anyone here knows it, but it's been leaking for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16318.299s">It's</a> only a 23-year-old building, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16323.203s">That's</a> when I asked for the bike path to be built from those schools to Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16329.068s">And</a> finally, it looks like it's getting done. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16330.89s">I'm</a> impressed so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16333.312s">But</a> the point is, there's over 7,000 wood frame homes in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16338.597s">I'm</a> guesstimating. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16340.699s">And</a> it seems like they're all still standing. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16345.248s">And</a> most of the people back 70, 80, 90, 100 years ago when they were built, most of them were legal immigrants, and they didn't make much cash, salary-wise. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16357.755s">But</a> yet, they kept them afloat, and they're still standing. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16362.117s">So</a> it hurts me to think, I remember when they built the Method Library in 59, and it seems like 63 years later, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16373.419s">A</a> brick and mortar building is condemned and they had to rebuild it for 30 million plus two from Bloomberg. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16379.763s">And</a> if you see the configuration of the two or three roofs, it's like an invitation for snow and leaks to occur, in my humble opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16392.15s">I'm</a> not a contractor. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16394.171s">So</a> the police station, same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16396.853s">I</a> remember being a customer there back in 63 when that was built, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16407.226s">And</a> I told my friends, it was their fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16413.012s">They</a> weren't quick on their feet like I was.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16419.258s">That</a> was five, six years before that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16423.202s">So</a> what I'm trying to say is, if I cut out the Milwaukee, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16432.247s">brick</a> and mortar buildings owned by the city of Medford, our most precious assets are not being taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16439.833s">And</a> we don't need no debt overrides, a prop two and a half overrides, debt exclusions.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_VjU9zacMOgA/2024-06-01_VjU9zacMOgA.html">City Council Public Works and Facilities Committee 01-31-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2945.155s">I</a> want to congratulate all the new Councilors that were elected, first of all. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2949.756s">I</a> also want to thank all the other political figures that ran and spent a lot of time and effort and cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2957.718s">And</a> I want to thank them for trying hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2963.119s">I</a> came because on this agenda, it does say 19-554. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2967.941s">I</a> didn't realize it was six years ago when I brought this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2975.936s">and</a> before that, and it says resolution to add noise barriers along Route 93 on the north side. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2986.441s">So</a> I'm here to correct this because it was done, well, first of all, I should back up to like more than 10 years ago, I believe, when, as you mentioned, <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3001.325s">Mr.</a> Donato, the state rep, he had done great things for the city, including getting Chevalier all kinds of seats, and you're speaking about trees, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3012.889s">So</a> he's had some good clout in the state house. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3016.59s">However,</a> when he came forward and said, I have the cash in place in order to add a sound barrier on one side only, and that was the west side. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3031.499s">which</a> is the West Medford side of 93, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3037.624s">So</a> I said to him, and he didn't like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3043.41s">I</a> said, Mr. Donato, if you're gonna give it to one child, why not give it to the other side of the Route 93 child? <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3050.854s">And</a> he made a comment, I don't want to misquote him, but it's something to the effect like, oh, I've had a few complaints from some East side residents on the East Medford side. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3064.102s">So</a> my reply to him was, I can't see how a few people can sway <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3071.772s">You,</a> as an individual, not to give it to our east side. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3079.116s">So</a> I don't recollect if there was any comment after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3082.519s">As</a> a matter of fact, there probably was not. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3086.401s">So</a> I was ecstatic to see this on the agenda yesterday, and that's why I am here. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3095.086s">However,</a> I'd like to see this corrected <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3101.235s">to</a> state that on the east side of 93, not the north side, because this is west, east is on the opposite side, and it's not north. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3116.4s">And</a> as Councilor Bears, I believe, mentioned certain areas that should have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3122.001s">And</a> I believe he said, and he's right, where I am near Riverside Avenue, it should start <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3129.266s">not</a> just at Riverside Avenue, further south, about a football field, three, four, 500 feet, probably. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3139.488s">Actually,</a> we're right on top of the river, on the bridge, behind the Senior Citizen Center, because there's at least five condominium complexes there, and houses on the Ship Ave and Marine Street area, which is, that alone has gotta be, <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3160.067s">500</a> units.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3193.542s">Also</a> 93 goes in the opposite direction towards Boston South.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3227.839s">So</a> I think there's a semantics by my mentality.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3241.147s">I</a> got a pretty good compass rose in my head. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3243.148s">You</a> know, I know my directions quite well. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3246.572s">And</a> also, who wrote up the resolution? <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3249.695s">Does</a> it state where it starts and where it finishes?
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3255.101s">Does</a> it state where this barrier would start and where it finishes?
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3261.909s">Who</a> makes that determination, us?
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3309.137s">So</a> do we know when this, if it ever gets started, when this will start?
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3315.741s">Can</a> you ballpark that timeline?
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3328.988s">I</a> really would appreciate that for at least half the population of the city, over 30,000 on the east side. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3334.73s">We</a> keep getting the short end of the stick.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3337.471s">And</a> we supply more real estate taxes than all the other three sections of Medford combined probably.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3345.086s">I</a> want to say thank you, but it would be nice if it was done from day one, east meets west.<h2><a href="../2024-10-05_j424Dcv3DNY/2024-10-05_j424Dcv3DNY.html">City Council 12-12-23</a></h2>

Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2818.055s">I</a> haven't been here in a while, and I'll make this very brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2822.178s">It</a> is election time in two weeks, and I have some pros and cons for the city of Medford that concern me and other voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2831.817s">Number</a> one, on a positive note, we have the best, as you know, location in all of New England, five miles north of Boston, Interstate Route 93. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2843.726s">Can't</a> beat it, and mostly residential community, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2848.109s">On</a> the con side, I live in Mystic Ave, and in 1960, they built Route 93. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2854.895s">That</a> was 63 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2863.373s">Mr.</a> Gav was kind of like in rough condition business-wise in those days. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2868.495s">It's</a> the same old song and dance, mostly cars and car lots and too many cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2876.879s">And</a> it's just a disaster. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2880.32s">So</a> I was thinking out loud here that we should have requests for proposals from the best you can get, even from the boys from New York City and the New York Minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2892.725s">to</a> give us the best, as Murata would say, best possible use for that land while we're still here. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2899.207s">And</a> don't forget, it's like 63-year relic. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2903.428s">This</a> is a great opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2905.588s">It's</a> probably 35 times more valuable today than it was 63 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2913.31s">So</a> if I was in charge, I would have mixed shoes, like the Roman Empire did business <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2921.715s">The</a> first floor would be business, commercial, even a 24-hour donut and coffee shop, and other commercial businesses, retail. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2929.722s">Second</a> floor, you could do offices, whatever, insurance companies, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2934.506s">And</a> the third floor up to this, whatever, six, seven, eight, nine, especially on the east side of the, which is next to 93, it's a lot of land back there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2945.515s">You</a> could have affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2948.86s">I</a> mean really affordable housing instead of what they call affordable. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2953.581s">And</a> this is a golden opportunity, especially with the rental problems these days. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2965.324s">And</a> then maybe after you have all these residential units, maybe you'd be able to adopt by chapter 59, section 5C, the owner-occupied real estate tax exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2974.385s">Although</a> not everybody would be grateful about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2980.669s">So</a> I guess I said enough about that golden opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2985.571s">But</a> first we have safety issues in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2988.532s">And</a> number one I have is the same old song from when I was here three months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2994.974s">It's</a> Roosevelt Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2997.414s">Get</a> on 93 right here, go north, first exit is Roosevelt Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3004.067s">As</a> you're going around the intersection, the roundabouts, as they say in Great Britain, there's weeds that are taller than me, they're six feet tall. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3012.749s">And</a> it's an obstruction, it's a danger, it's a safety problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3018.05s">And</a> the cars are flying around there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3019.91s">And</a> guess what I found out, coming back from my friends from our walk around the Hidden Reservoir, coming down 93, <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3029.005s">from</a> Stoneham to Roseville Circle, it's worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3032.727s">Not</a> only do you have eight foot weeds, you have 30, 40, 50 foot high junk trees, wild. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3041.372s">And</a> you cannot see what's coming around the bend on the roundabout. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3046.696s">There's</a> been too many accidents there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3049.858s">You</a> can say, hey Andrew, this is MG, it's a state issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3055.281s">Do</a> you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3056.181s">I'm</a> not that smart, maybe you people are city councilors, <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3059.124s">that</a> are smarter and more honorable. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3062.186s">Maybe</a> you should just check it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3064.347s">And</a> if you feel it's an issue, you drop the dime to the state and not leave it on Castagnetti. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3070.611s">You</a> might have more pull. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3072.572s">I'm</a> tired. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3073.732s">I've</a> been fighting the city for too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3076.074s">And</a> I've come up with solutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3077.975s">I'm</a> not trying to be negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3081.657s">Another</a> one's a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3083.098s">I'm</a> gonna talk fast because you're not gonna wanna hear about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3085.779s">You're</a> on Mystic Avenue from Somerville driving <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3090.401s">38</a> north towards Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3092.522s">As</a> you pass Harvard Street, you have two lanes on both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3096.363s">There's</a> no cars parked there at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3099.263s">It's</a> a state road. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3101.004s">It's</a> the old highway to Boston before Route 93. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3107.205s">And</a> then all of a sudden, we're doing 40, 50, some are doing 60 miles an hour on average. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3113.687s">I'm</a> not pushing the number here. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3115.847s">And</a> all of a sudden, it merges into one lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3121.494s">And</a> instead of no cars, right after Atlas and Hancock Street, as you mentioned earlier, Councilor, there's five cars parked there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3133.042s">Why</a> can't they park further down in front of the VFW or the Verizon building? <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3139.206s">That</a> gives us an extra 100 feet to make the adjustment. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3142.248s">I</a> see a car roll over there with an accident with an elderly lady. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3146.311s">There's</a> too many accidents in that location. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3148.868s">I'm</a> not gonna say it again for the fourth time, so I said it for the third time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3152.069s">I</a> wonder about this missing bike path right behind you, Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3159.313s">The</a> bike path comes from Arlington, West Medford, it goes right into Medford Square, right behind you, at the Senior Citizen Center, it stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3168.897s">It's</a> a half a mile blockage. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3171.966s">Once</a> you get to the Doug Andrews School, 23 years ago they were built, you had a bike path all the way to take the subway, you don't have to worry about driving down Willis Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3180.855s">You</a> could take your bicycle, you could walk too, or a wheelchair. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3187.561s">So</a> what happened to this missing bike path? <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3191.445s">Can</a> anyone tell me what's going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3193.387s">When</a> will it be done? <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3195.515s">All</a> these people want more transportation, but what is going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3198.718s">It's</a> been five, six, seven years I've been working on this and broke my head in one of the potholes there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3204.183s">Can</a> someone tell me, please?
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3217.728s">Cool,</a> and by the way, it's gonna be within 12 feet of mean high tide next to the river, I hope, because that's the Massachusetts law back in the 1700s on the riparian rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3228.714s">You</a> know about that, right, Councilor? <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3229.995s">I</a> absolutely do. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3230.835s">I'm</a> glad you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3232.396s">I</a> always said you were smart. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3234.757s">But</a> let's get the job done.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3237.499s">I</a> don't wanna get PO'd, man.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3239.64s">I</a> wanna be able to use it with a bicycle, and not have, down the road, they have to use a wheelchair.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3245.583s">Oh,</a> come on, this is ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3249.232s">Okay,</a> I'm gonna keep my animation down. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3252.354s">And</a> what about the marathon bombing? <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3256.137s">2000,</a> what? <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3257.137s">My</a> wife had cancer, I was in Mass General. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3260.459s">I</a> wanted to go, she said, I don't want to go, let's go, I've never been there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3263.281s">Thank</a> God we didn't go. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3265.262s">And</a> I missed the Dalai Lama too, at the Buddhist temple. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3269.085s">But</a> the point is, McGlynn, Mayor McGlynn, he got a lot of business people at the Chamber of Commerce <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3276.496s">thousands,</a> tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands to build the Kristin Campbell fountain. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3284.179s">I</a> don't see any activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3285.759s">I</a> don't see any water spouting out of that for at least months, years. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3289.501s">But</a> Mr. Scarpelli, Mr. Caraviello, can you help me?
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3294.663s">The</a> parts are on order? <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3296.243s">They</a> can't get the parts?
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3337.787s">Where</a> is it, a pump? <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3339.228s">What's</a> a pump, $100?
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3357.633s">I</a> know you've always been good about these things, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3360.155s">I</a> appreciate your help. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3361.156s">You</a> have good common sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3362.276s">I</a> want to say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3362.917s">I'm</a> going to say it again later.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3370.042s">Where</a> is the scoop? <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3372.723s">I</a> shouldn't say this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3374.204s">Where</a> is the scoop on all the silence with the airplanes running? <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3378.444s">runway</a> 33L. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3379.144s">It's</a> another construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3380.985s">Haven't</a> heard a plane in months or months. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3382.886s">That's</a> why I'm going. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3384.606s">Yeah,</a> just don't jinx it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3388.708s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3389.548s">Somebody</a> must know the answer.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3396.091s">Maybe</a> they forgot about us.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3398.192s">Let's</a> hope is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3400.432s">I</a> must thank City Councilor Caraviello for having great common sense all these years. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3407.711s">I</a> really, we thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3410.072s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3411.633s">And</a> hopefully your concern will come to materialize and fruition about that guy, that big guy north of Richmond might cause a drag us into a World War III.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3430.28s">I</a> saw buying Camel cigarettes at 1750. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3432.341s">It</a> must be Biden economics. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3437.138s">It</a> used to be 28 cents a pack. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3438.819s">28</a> cents a pack, 1962, when the first bar movie came out, Dr. No. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3443.14s">The</a> stock market went up so many times, the cigarettes went up more, 20% more than the Dow Jones. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3450.081s">Can</a> you imagine? <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3450.801s">Larry</a> knows what I'm speaking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3453.942s">Okay,</a> you city councilors, would you want to take this opportunity to tell the voters of your best accomplishment in the past two years, starting with Councilor Knight, but I think he's indisposed.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3466.323s">Going</a> to tell us, can you, can Council build some of your best accomplishment in the last two years? <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3470.246s">And</a> I want to go around the horn. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3471.687s">I'm</a> sure the voters want to know.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3477.652s">You</a> don't get into that, you said? <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3479.193s">No?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3480.754s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3481.935s">Lastly,</a> I have a really, really cool idea for the city, for the best landmark. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3488.38s">What's</a> the, it's essential or something? <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3489.741s">The</a> best landmark in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3491.723s">Do</a> you know what the best landmark would be in your opinions? <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3496.451s">Not</a> the big or low building. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3499.392s">Do</a> you anybody have an idea? <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3500.853s">The</a> best landmark in this city, what would that be? <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3504.115s">Like</a> a square? <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3504.975s">Wright's</a> Tower. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3506.136s">Wright's</a> Tower. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3508.037s">How</a> about the London? <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3510.958s">How</a> about the footbridge behind Old Craddock's? <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3515.62s">The</a> footbridge over the Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3522.363s">I</a> think it would be really cool <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3524.113s">If</a> you did a like a salt and pepper thing like the bridge in Boston Council bid maybe you take $100 instead. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3533.904s">I'm,</a> I'm offering $100. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3536.207s">I</a> donate this to the city to put two strands of Christmas lights on each side of that footbridge since you don't know where to send that direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3547.182s">It</a> would look really cool with the lights glowing, have it come on at dusk. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3550.283s">And</a> by the way, my old electrician used to work for the city, Jimmy Abagast told me, and I saw it, the pole was right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3556.064s">It's</a> called the electric pole. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3558.404s">I</a> could spit at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3560.204s">It's</a> only five feet away from the bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3562.725s">So</a> Mr. City messenger, please take this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3566.806s">I</a> want you to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3570.126s">I</a> want you to message it over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3572.127s">Please</a> write a check. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3574.764s">Can</a> you please get this to the mayor?
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3605.98s">No,</a> I want you to give it to the mayor.

 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=2026.969s">I</a> have a simple possible solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=2034.32s">um</a> to make some sort of a spray ball and fill it with maybe a hot pepper liquid or something and spray the top of the lid so they would have some hot pepper and they might stop that business you know and because i don't think they like licking the hot pepper as they're chewing you know anyways that's one if you heard it yep thank you <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=2062.546s">okay</a> number two as far as the rubbish bottles um the raccoons are pretty cunning and they have hands and fingers they open those barrels i've seen them open the barrels they jump right in i don't know how the hell they get out or maybe they get dumped into the rubbish truck <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=2079.402s">So</a> what I do is I put a small bungee cord, there's a hole on top of the lid in the front, and I can actually bungee cord it with a four-inch bungee, or you could tie it yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=2090.59s">But</a> just make sure when it's time to go out to the track, you untie it, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=2095.353s">That</a> was number two. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=2097.975s">And</a> I have an addendum. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=2099.816s">Did</a> I hear Councilor Bears say something like playoffs? <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=2104.96s">You</a> mentioned that at seven o'clock earlier.

 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=2124.42s">Okay,</a> it wasn't a playoff, it was an override. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=2128.604s">Okay,</a> which has to be voted on by the public.

 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1042.658s">Yeah,</a> since this subject has come up again and again and again, I recollect when Councilor De La Ruza was here, he called the plot holes plot holders. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1055.231s">But</a> anyways, I brought this up years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1057.713s">I</a> kind of understand why you fix a pothole, and then it regurgitates, and it becomes a pothole again after it was patched. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1067.461s">I</a> brought this up years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1069.162s">Maybe</a> we should reach out to other TPW yachts, such as Buffalo, New York, or Montreal, Quebec, wherever, someplace in Maine, where they have probably more potholes than we have, since they probably use more salt. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1085.33s">If</a> I DPW could reach out our administration, maybe there's a better way to build a mousetrap. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1092.839s">Maybe</a> if you cut them at an angle, what a task skills are, I'm not sure, whether it's slanted in or slanted out, or different type of material. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1104.82s">but</a> it seems like we're fighting mother nature and it's the same old song and dance. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1109.163s">I've</a> also lost two tires on the old 2155 out streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1114.347s">I</a> have yet to put in to get paid for one, but I think this time it's more time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1121.432s">And</a> of course, Councilor Knight lost two at one shot on Mystic Avenue, but you gotta pay attention out there too.

 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1364.083s">the</a> 85% of the home occupied would receive savings instead of the usual 4% increases, which happens by clockwork instead of prop two and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1374.851s">It's</a> more like four or 5%, especially with my two family. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1378.233s">And</a> yes, I would see an increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1380.115s">So</a> I'm not here to save money for me, it would cost me. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1383.998s">But</a> 85% of the people are gonna save. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1389.018s">instead</a> of the usual 4% tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1392.921s">Also,</a> if it's such a bad program, why is all these communities, especially some of them with a maximum of 35% shift exemption, why are they still in the program? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1404.628s">They</a> can drop out anytime. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1406.029s">So</a> could we, if we got in. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1408.131s">And</a> also, I don't wanna see anyone's bills go up personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1412.534s">I</a> think the tax man gets more than their fair share. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1415.936s">It</a> just never ends. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1418.017s">If</a> you wanna help, <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1419.191s">the</a> renters, I suggest you all talk to your president in Washington DC to get them to reverse the energy situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1429.74s">Because</a> I've never seen this inflation since when Jimmy Carter was there in the 70s. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1434.103s">And</a> we had gas lines to buy gasoline for our vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1438.927s">And</a> if it's so complicated, it can't be rocket science if all these communities are doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1447.774s">Boston,</a> I missed Everett, Chelsea, Cambridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1453.137s">It</a> started in Nantucket originally. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1456.199s">And</a> the formula is defective, I'll agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1460.282s">It</a> should not be a cutoff point of $700,000 or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1465.525s">It</a> should be rewritten at the state house that take the exemption amount of that tax swing at 35%, for example, it should be even dollars <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1477.137s">for</a> every owner occupied one set amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1480.718s">It</a> can't be that hard to do the mathematics. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1482.578s">Instead</a> of someone saving 2,000, which is not right, which will happen in the Heights more than downtown. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1491.019s">It</a> should be one set figure, probably $700 it might come out to for every single owner occupied. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1497.541s">I</a> rest my case.

 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12828.287s">I'm</a> not talking about a peon, especially if, if, if the injured party were not respected properly, maybe set an example and teach it some good lessons. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12840.554s">Um,</a> I could go on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12845.588s">But</a> to make it brief, if you're not getting a response, well, maybe it's true. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12849.851s">Maybe</a> I've heard this years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12851.893s">I</a> never believed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12853.434s">So</a> maybe it's true that the tail of the school committee is wagging the city's dog. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12860.38s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12861.241s">I</a> never went to a school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12862.642s">I</a> have no interest in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12864.023s">They</a> are full houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12866.024s">I</a> don't know if they're allowed to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12868.206s">As</a> a matter of fact, at what time? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12872.982s">quarter</a> to 11, there's over 60 people on the Zoom meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12877.463s">And</a> it seems like most of them are school committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12880.924s">If</a> you're not getting responses, maybe they could tune in and plug in right now, hit the button. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12886.306s">This</a> is not acceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12887.646s">This</a> is real bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12889.026s">What</a> if it was you? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12892.167s">Get</a> your stones together, cast a stone, rewrite it if you have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12896.668s">Night</a> is bright.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_80br4JUepho/2024-11-19_80br4JUepho.html">City Council 10-11-22</a></h2>

 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4552.383s">Good</a> evening, Andrew Castagnetti, East Medford Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4555.746s">I'll</a> be very brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4557.848s">I'm</a> actually glad that you're a day late and a dollar short and not going to be able to get this Prop 2.5 override on this November's ballot, because a lot of the taxpayers are struggling to pay their bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4570.939s">As</a> you said, with inflation, especially the homeowners, <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4575.393s">Matter</a> of fact, we already got hit last December when we set the tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4579.855s">My</a> hit was probably $450, an extra charge that just started this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4587.338s">And</a> if this $12 million override went through, I'm hearing it's gonna cost 800, it's gonna cost me $1,000 extra. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4596.122s">At</a> the worst scenario, and I'm not for overrides of two and a half, God rest Barbara Anderson's soul, <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4604.162s">Although</a> the law is flawed on a state level, and I'll get into it some other time. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4607.784s">Because</a> everyone, every single owner occupied should get the same dollar amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4614.646s">And</a> that would make it fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4617.528s">But</a> I got to fight City Hall and Medford before I can fight the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4622.67s">But</a> I know my idea is perfect if I can get the right mathematician to do the math. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4628.372s">So</a> I don't need a thousand dollar jump on top of it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4633.213s">And</a> we're not Winchester with these overrides of two and a half or debt exclusions. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4638.62s">Never</a> been done in this town. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4641.263s">However,</a> if it did something like this for $12 million, that would cost me a thousand dollars one shot this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4646.29s">I</a> want you to do that debt override business. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4649.233s">It'll</a> probably cost $40 per annum. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4652.432s">instead</a> of $1,000 per year for 20 years until the debt is paid, then it stops.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4687.379s">Okay,</a> so like Winchester, I went to legal for $100 million debt exclusion to build the Winchester High School a few years back. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4693.441s">And</a> that was 800 bucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4695.502s">per</a> quarter for 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4698.885s">So</a> at least if you can't help relieve the taxpayer, as Dr. Sorella would say, come down even one lousy dollar. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4708.615s">But</a> if you can't really help the taxpayer, give them tax relief, or hear her, at least do no harm. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4714.861s">Thank</a> you for not getting it in a timely manner.

 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7761.278s">Would</a> you like to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7768.683s">No,</a> he's good. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7770.144s">I'm</a> going to say something that's probably a bit insensitive, but I'm going to fix it with a solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7781.011s">My</a> godfather from Northern Italian dialect used to say to me, <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7790.263s">On</a> the first of the month, he who laughs and he or she who cries. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7795.291s">In</a> other words, landlord tenant situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7799.157s">And</a> I think what he meant by that was, <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7801.954s">that</a> if you can afford to buy the house, for some, even if they can, they don't want the headaches. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7807.601s">And</a> I understand, believe me. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7809.524s">But</a> eventually after 25, 30, 35 year payments, you own it free and clear, hopefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7817.033s">And</a> then you are in control of your own destiny, hopefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7822.362s">So,</a> there is a solution and you don't need the state for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7825.803s">You</a> can do it right here, especially on that mile of Mystic Avenue, the old highway to Boston 38 could do it like New York City does to control your rents. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7835.807s">They</a> have the cooperative housing I believe that's the term. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7839.648s">Have</a> you heard of a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7841.529s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7842.569s">So,</a> whether it's. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7844.718s">private</a> or quasi government and quasi private, a mixture. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7850.601s">And</a> you could, the rents would be locked in with minimal increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7857.885s">It</a> can't be that hard to do if someone wants to get going. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7863.548s">But</a> also in Vienna, Austria, <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7868.498s">I</a> cut out an article from the Boston Globe, but my wife has me throwing out papers, so I discarded it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7874.72s">It's</a> a huge building, and it's quasi government and private, and everybody seems to be happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7882.541s">It's</a> not like a development or a project type that we have here. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7886.562s">I</a> mean, it has a swimming pools, it has everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7892.364s">So</a> it can be done if somebody wants to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7896.625s">Thank</a> you for listening.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11788.838s">Castagnetti.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11792.88s">When</a> I grew up as a kid on Mystic Ave in a house that was built in the 1750s, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11801.603s">It</a> used to be where Governor's Ave is. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11805.125s">They</a> moved it to Mystic Ave to make Governor's Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11809.686s">A</a> reasonable facsimile of Commonwealth Avenue in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11812.427s">Hence,</a> you have the islands in the middle, but you don't have those beautiful brownstones. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11816.989s">My</a> father used to say to me, <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11819.112s">with</a> a sixth grade education method is anti-business. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11826.293s">So</a> he said, look, the only two businesses that are making it that's Cal's diner and Hosmer. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11838.515s">And</a> constant light is getting ahead of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11842.576s">Carol's</a> is still is there as part two location. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11848.866s">They</a> had a beautiful location, Grosvenor Police Station and the fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11854.39s">And</a> Hosmer is now Grava. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11859.573s">Hosmer</a> Chiefs, baseball? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11862.455s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11863.556s">So</a> I'm agreeing with these two gentlemen to my left and right. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11871.601s">I</a> understand historical, I like to keep character. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11875.964s">However,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11877.752s">Even</a> though we have over 10,000 houses at over 100 years old, to me they're not historical per se. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11884.636s">The</a> real house, house my father owned, I'm not mentioning where, because he might have problems down the road when they start destroying Mr. Gav to rebuild. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11896.164s">So</a> I'm not going to flip the card over. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11899.766s">We're</a> anti-business. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11902.372s">If</a> my house is built in 1910, it should not be questioned, it might be historical. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11907.456s">If</a> a developer wants to come in and rip it down, I understand you want to keep up the character, but you've got to develop the Councilor mindset and then add extra real estate tax base. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11923.029s">It's</a> sad, they have to wait a year and a half to knock it down, is that right? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11928.273s">And</a> they have to put up some serious money. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11931.452s">and</a> they have to carry that, and they still have to need the approval, mind you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11935.893s">And</a> some of them went bankrupt, me and me on Riverside Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11939.234s">I'd</a> like to buy that parcel and do it myself, if it's not too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11944.295s">You</a> can't be anti-business to a point that you're crippling our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11948.876s">I</a> think I'm gonna stop talking. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11953.377s">I'm</a> kind of upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11955.577s">It's</a> just overkill. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11958.378s">It</a> really is.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_E3nlU10YCrs/2024-11-19_E3nlU10YCrs.html">City Council 07-19-22</a></h2>
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=2012.917s">Mr.</a> Andrew Paul Castagnetti, Cushing Street, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=2018.296s">I</a> never thought I would say this. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=2020.217s">It's</a> like 53 years since I've been to Woodstock 1969. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=2023.218s">And</a> I was not a big fan of method cops in those days. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=2031.14s">However,</a> things certainly changed in the last two or three decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=2036.982s">And</a> I truly respect them a lot more than back then. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=2040.303s">So</a> I just want, especially in these trying times out there in this country, in the world, <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=2046.05s">I</a> believe we should back boys and girls in blue because they've come a long way since the safe deposit box heist.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6655.042s">Thank</a> you, Council President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6656.943s">Good</a> evening, honorable councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6660.124s">My</a> name is Mr. Andrew P. Castagnetti, and usually I speak last on issues and to throw out my Andrew-isms or sort of, but Councilor Marks allowed me to speak first, and I'm gonna let the best, all these speakers, if they come forward to be, come last. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6683.352s">I</a> just wanted to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6685.723s">I'm</a> going to add a few points, I'll make it probably less than three minutes without point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6695.489s">This,</a> no matter how you disguise this, it's not written on 22-439, but basically we all know it's a prop two and a half override, never been done in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6709.078s">Winchester's</a> done many of them and dead exclusions. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6715.106s">So</a> if it's 12 million, why not go for 10 times that 120 million while we're at it? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6723.353s">Because</a> it's never enough, is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6727.957s">For</a> the tax man or tax woman, the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6733.421s">What's</a> next? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6734.963s">Is</a> this a prelude for a $300 million bond for a new high school, which ain't so new in 52 years? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6745.12s">due</a> to lack of maintenance amongst other buildings that were only 52 years old, library, police, fire, DPW, that's a different story. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6755.905s">You're</a> financially killing the working class heroes, especially the fixed income retirees. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6764.489s">Don't</a> you care? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6768.411s">Don't</a> you care? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6770.807s">You've</a> talked about housing affordability in Medford many, many, many times. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6776.51s">Even</a> the newies spoke of this, especially them who's paying rent or doesn't even own home property. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6784.433s">Doesn't</a> have to pay real estate tax per se. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6788.115s">Your</a> $12 million prop two and a half override will cost us probably more like 10 to 12% more on the current bill starting this fiscal year, which is already started. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6801.678s">and</a> you are still refusing us, the homeowners, my baby, Mass General Award, Chapter 59, Section 5C, the owner-occupied real estate tax exemption at the full 35% shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6817.722s">We've</a> lost over $2,000 a year, on average, per household. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6829.224s">Since</a> the Commonwealth of Massachusetts adopted this in 1998, mind you, that's 22 years or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6836.587s">Imagine,</a> even the state politicians had some compassion to help the owner-occupied homeowners, and many cities have adopted this savings. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6847.671s">Somerville,</a> Everett, Malvern, Boston, even Senator Kerry gets it at 28 Lewisbury Square, if that's his legal address, he's not lying to the IRS, again. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6859.033s">And</a> they're still doing it after years. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6861.676s">Does</a> that tell us it works or does not work? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6865.881s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6866.502s">Maybe</a> my common sense is going south. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6869.886s">I</a> think it works just fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6872.109s">It's</a> still in the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6874.011s">They</a> didn't unadopt it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6875.432s">They</a> adopted it and they're still using it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6878.766s">I've</a> been asking you all for this real estate tax relief for 19 years, and be aware, this will not cost the city hall, a dime, Mr. Orlando, because the tax savings that the owner occupied would save is simply shifted to the absentee maybe slumlords. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6904.079s">So</a> the city gets dime number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6907.053s">What</a> if people don't understand that? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6908.754s">I</a> read the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6909.934s">I</a> have a sixth grade education, but I read the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6912.515s">Has</a> everyone here read the law? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6914.455s">Has</a> anyone read the law? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6916.176s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6917.436s">Hold</a> that thought, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6920.277s">So</a> again, I ask you all again, why not here? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6925.559s">Come</a> on, man.

 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1280.825s">Okay,</a> in that case, I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to make the committee of the whole if it exists in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1287.67s">So</a> basically, I wrote this up real quick for tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1290.332s">I'm</a> a little nervous, so please bear with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1294.775s">This</a> law, the Mass General Law, Chapter 59, Section 5C, was started in 1998, for your information, 24 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1307.069s">Imagine</a> even our state politicians had the compassion to pass this law to help lower the real estate tax for owner-occupied homeowners. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1319.015s">But</a> only, it's only if you, the mayor, and the council adopt this law at the full 35% exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1329.94s">Do</a> you councils have, have you all, any of you, have you read the law in full? <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1339.783s">Okay,</a> hearing none and seeing you not, thank you, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1345.965s">These</a> cities have adopted this law and are saving their own occupied homeowners tons of real estate tax monies. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1357.269s">That's</a> Chelsea, Everett, Malden, Cambridge, Somerville, and all of Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1363.891s">Even</a> Senator Kerry gets it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1366.954s">28</a> Lewisburg Square, if that in fact is correct address according to the IRS. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1373.736s">And</a> I believe these cities are still in none have dropped out, which tells me the majority must be quite happy with this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1386.332s">Therefore,</a> I strongly suggest that we, you, in the mirror, also adopt Mass General Law, Chapter 59, Section 5C, here in Medford, at the full 35% exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1401.761s">I</a> want to thank you for listening and bringing this up more than six months prior to setting the tax rate in December, as I asked you to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1411.467s">And</a> I want to commend you again for bringing it up eight months prior <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1417.143s">Are</a> there any questions or comments while I'm here?
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1427.135s">I</a> hope to be able to make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1428.716s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_NqJnNNyD4Uw/2024-11-19_NqJnNNyD4Uw.html">City Council 02-15-22</a></h2>

 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=4257.833s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=4263.526s">One</a> time ago, I'm wondering if, if there's a better way to fill these potholes so they actually stay filled, or as Councilor Dello Russo called them, potholes.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=4277.65s">So</a> I was thinking a little further out of the box. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=4280.331s">Maybe</a> we should speak to someone who has more experience than us in colder fluctuations of temperatures up and down, such as. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=4288.832s">Montreal,</a> Ottawa, Vancouver, Iceland, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=4293.255s">But</a> it seems like they pop up everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=4297.538s">As</a> Councilor Marches has said, I go put a glass of milk in my dish, on my dashboard, and by the time I get to Brigham's, it becomes a milkshake. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=4306.743s">It</a> is bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=4307.304s">There's</a> gotta be a better way of, <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=4311.242s">fill</a> in the holes, I mean, maybe cut them at an angle, whether it's inside or outside going down. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=4317.626s">I'm</a> not sure, but it doesn't make sense why it just keeps crumbling. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=4322.59s">It's</a> getting worse and worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=4324.291s">And</a> to fix the a hundred miles of roads, it would cost more than what the government gave us, the 15 million, by the way.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_s4ePTNAg4Nw/2024-11-19_s4ePTNAg4Nw.html">City Council 02-08-22</a></h2>

 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3974.953s">Thank</a> you, Mr. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3976.55s">President</a> Andrew, for me, Smith, I'll be very brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3979.491s">Councilor</a> Morell brings up some good points. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3982.852s">I</a> wouldn't want anyone to get told, unless they're in front of my driveway, or they're causing problems near where I have to navigate with my vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3991.275s">On</a> the other hand, signage, as Councilor Caraviello stated, that we get enough signs, it's more than sign pollution, it's sign confusion also. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4003.2s">And</a> the ex-chief, <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4005.447s">Leo</a> Sacco used to say, we have too many signs in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4010.23s">I</a> don't want to add any more. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4013.312s">So</a> I guess the song says, signs, signs, everywhere is signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4018.034s">Don't</a> do this, don't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4019.455s">Can't</a> you read the sign? <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4020.716s">However,</a> we need solutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4022.537s">You</a> already have a field that worked, it worked for me and some of my neighbors, and actually there were absentee owner tenants. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4031.823s">And</a> I was impressed that they paid attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4034.841s">being</a> absentee tenants, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4039.544s">So</a> you do the reverse 9-1-1, and I guess you do an email, I understand, this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4044.867s">The</a> only other solution I can come up with is maybe get a Times Square billboard in the middle of the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4050.53s">But</a> it's still never gonna satisfy all the people at any time. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4055.373s">I</a> wish you good luck.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5963.166s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Bears for bringing up higher pay for the cannabis industry, especially with three entities soon hopefully to be opened in Medford, and who knows what other type of cannabis entities might also open down the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5983.133s">I</a> want to thank you for that, because I'm sure it's a very lucrative business. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5988.018s">especially</a> with only three in the city at this point coming, unless there's too much competition, that might affect their profitability, of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5999.106s">But</a> I'm interested in Mr. Camucho, if he's still there, I'd like to make a point that I believe he said that some of these cannabis owners, <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6012.199s">have</a> paid fines on the unfair labor practices come with the Massachusetts.

 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6085.188s">What's</a> the name of that company, sir?
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6101.579s">Do</a> you know the name of that company, Mr. Camucho?

 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8250.547s">Right,</a> so I simply wanted to say before, I believe there's good and bad in every race, creed, and religion, and I believe Martin Luther King had the right idea, we should judge man or woman by their character. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8263.933s">Now,</a> onto the subject at hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8266.554s">Councilor</a> Marks is right on, as usual. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8271.256s">I</a> remember when the previous mayor was gonna sell her for a song, a cheap song at that, <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8278.234s">and</a> I think believe Council Marks and Caraviello was saving it for the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8283.978s">And</a> Council Marks is always also right about when the three to three vote for the Swan School was the deciding dagger in the table was by Councilor Muccini-Burke at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8300.27s">And</a> that's why we lost the vote four to three to get the Swan School for the TB3 and methadoxinitis and the, <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8308.922s">Method</a> Arts Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8310.563s">Council</a> March has been right on for over two decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8314.425s">Anyways,</a> maybe this opportunity for the artists might come somewhere else, it seems to me in my gut feeling. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8322.95s">So</a> maybe this would, it is cost prohibitive <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8326.548s">and</a> maybe you people should just sell it our city building to a developer dependent on the square footage and just demolish it and make more hopefully affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8338.394s">I</a> have no further comments.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19__tT-sIarT8Q/2024-11-19__tT-sIarT8Q.html">City Council 09-21-21</a></h2>

 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8853.394s">Andrew</a> Castagnetti, 23 Cushing Street, Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8858.176s">I</a> sincerely want to thank City Councilor Morell for bringing this up, especially the Clippership Connector part. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8867.281s">It's</a> very personal to me being injured in that location. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8875.785s">I</a> scribbled a few notes, I hope it makes sense, but this missing incomplete <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8883.132s">bike</a> community path. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8886.313s">And</a> we in Medford have the best location in all of New England, in my opinion, five miles north of Boston with Route 93 here. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8896.776s">But</a> you know, they can't seem to finish off the missing link, the half mile right behind 99 Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8905.859s">I</a> was supposed to wave to Mr. Sano, who lives there. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8910.24s">Anyways,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8912.045s">It's</a> sad because you could go from West Method and beyond, actually, you come right through here, if you didn't have the half mile blockage to the Duggar Andrews, you could go clear to the MBTA stations without dealing with Route 16 or Route 28. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8929.141s">That's</a> huge as a safety concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8934.09s">So</a> it's long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8936.852s">Personally,</a> in my opinion, it should have been done 20 years ago about when they built the two new schools, so-called two new schools, with bike paths and footpaths that go underneath Route 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8952.04s">Also,</a> they should do this job right. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8957.663s">Finish</a> this half-mile missing link in the center of Medford Square <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8963.396s">with</a> the Riparian Right Law. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8965.978s">It's</a> a 1600 Massachusetts law. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8970.302s">And</a> that means we the people have the right of pathway, egress, I believe it's 15 feet alongside waterways. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8983.553s">In</a> this case, the Mystic River and Blessing of the Bay. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8988.777s">Please,</a> build this missing link <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8993.14s">The</a> part that's missing is right next to the Doug Randrew School, that piece of land there. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9002.622s">And</a> then the next piece would be the Riverside Yacht Club. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9008.524s">And</a> then heading towards the square would be two condo buildings, 54 to 68, Ship Ave, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9018.746s">And</a> by the way, they have two fences on each end of the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9022.688s">that</a> go from the sidewalk all the way to the river, which, in my opinion, under riparian rights, is illegally built on the people's egress land. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9036.771s">And</a> then there's another building going towards 93 that will be the last building, the 76th shipyard, large condo complex of approximately 20 units. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9046.992s">They</a> have plenty of land and they didn't build any fences <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9051.996s">on</a> top of the people's land. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9054.218s">And</a> it continues around where I actually broke my hand with a bike injury when my bike found one of two potholes, four feet wide, one to two feet deep. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9066.046s">They're</a> still there. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9067.287s">They</a> put cones there. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9069.288s">I</a> found one on the river today, took my bike ride again. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9072.21s">I</a> put one cone inside the hole. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9077.194s">The</a> DCR, they should at least fill in the potholes, which is grass. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9083.664s">And</a> the storm outfall number is OF04100. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9091.486s">And</a> then it continues, the missing link I should say, does not continue, underneath 93 to behind the senior citizen center, which is the building in the back where Mr. Sano lives at 99 Riverside Avenue, the high affordable rent building. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9110.311s">It's</a> a lousy half a mile, we're talking like <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9114.093s">10,</a> 15 miles beyond Arlington, Lexington possibly. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9119.016s">Are</a> you kidding? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9119.997s">This</a> is ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9122.319s">Excuse</a> my lack of 10 cent words here, but I understand the wheels of government work slowly, but 20 years and still waiting is ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9138.47s">Come</a> on, man. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9141.809s">Let's</a> get the missing half-mile path done now and complete the 10-mile plus route to the MBTA assembly row and station landing, and safely keep with the people off the streets, especially Route 16 and Route 28. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9161.556s">This</a> is a no-brainer. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9164.177s">Please,</a> city, wake up.

 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3237.918s">Yes,</a> sir.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3240.9s">Thanks,</a> Councilor Marks, for bringing this on your agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3244.16s">And</a> I believe last week, Councilor Penta was right when he said back when we installed these meters in 2002, thereabouts, that as Councilor Penta says, they sold us a bill of sale. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3259.086s">It's</a> more like a bill of goods. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3261.307s">I</a> believe back then it was stated by the department heads in the water and Mr. Geer, that if there's an unusual increase in our water meters, <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3273.261s">that</a> we would be notified through the computer system. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3278.123s">And</a> I remember it like it was yesterday, even though it's probably 18 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3282.725s">So</a> a friend of mine received a bill instead of the usual bill, it was like six times per bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3295.471s">And</a> she owns Bell Raviolis, it happened in her home. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3301.573s">And</a> she was very upset about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3304.428s">I</a> guess she used the bathroom downstairs in the cellar and went upstairs and probably didn't go back for two more months until she received the bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3313.653s">Probably</a> six times the usual bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3316.755s">And</a> it's hard for her to make the steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3320.216s">So,</a> very sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3321.717s">She</a> went to pay the bill or actually question it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3326.24s">And</a> I guess she just paid it, period. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3328.901s">As</a> they say, it counts by city hall.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3349.174s">I'm</a> glad to hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3352.976s">So</a> therefore, since the city has approximately $5 million in the so-called water fund account, <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3361.568s">Basically,</a> in my opinion, it's like an overcharge to all us rate payers. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3368.149s">So</a> therefore, the money's just sitting there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3371.41s">Maybe</a> I'm thinking outside the box that the city could figure it out or the city council to give us a one strike, one time only shot. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3383.172s">If</a> it is increased by double and triple or better, that you could forgive it <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3391.386s">through</a> the $5 million overcharge fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3394.607s">Just</a> a thought, if you want to take it on the committee as a whole, because sometimes you face City Hall, if you appeal it, you probably, maybe you don't have any requests after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3408.47s">So</a> that's all I wanted to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3409.81s">You</a> might want to consider something like that with the $5 million, but the commission, that's what you're hiring.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3467.339s">All</a> right, because please urge you to do that to receive a bill that's like five or 10 or 20 times your usual. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3474.146s">That</a> might hurt a lot of people who are having struggles in these times. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3477.79s">Thank</a> you, sir.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_6Dwt4KXgHTk/2024-11-19_6Dwt4KXgHTk.html">City Council 04-13-21</a></h2>

Community? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5639.133s">Mystic</a> Ave Corridor. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5641.775s">The</a> Big Mac. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5645.817s">Although</a> no McDonald's is in Bedford, Burger King's down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5650.947s">But</a> the point is, unless we get a handle on this, if it's possible to avoid this 40B being jammed on our throats with all this congestion we already have, without our Orange Line subway behind you, we're gonna be in deep stuff, man. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5671.407s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5672.762s">I'm</a> not sure if you can do moratoriums or anything that's fancy with those 25 cent words, but chances are you can't if we're already in this 40 B thing with the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5684.728s">But,</a> carverum tuor, buyer beware, be careful.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_eQfu2R5n4yE/2024-11-19_eQfu2R5n4yE.html">City Council 01-14-20</a></h2>

majority of the homeowners. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=4854.541s">Number</a> five, I would want to reduce real estate tax bills for owner-occupied homeowners by adopting the full 35% under Massachusetts general law <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=4867.752s">Chapter</a> 59, Section 5C, as it is done, as Dr. Starella said, in Somerville, Malden, Everett, all of Boston, and other area communities, to provide some long overdue tax relief to homeowners. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=4892.133s">Please</a> be aware and assured <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=4897.962s">all</a> seven Councilors, and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=4900.303s">Mayor</a> Burke, the city would not lose any real estate tax dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=4909.246s">They</a> still will receive the whole real estate tax levy of $109.5 million, as they want, with a 4% increase from last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=4926.423s">Our</a> savings will simply be paid for by all others, such as absentee, residential only, residential homeowners who are absentee landlords, period. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=4942.443s">At</a> the tune of whatever it cost on their bill, I didn't get enough current factual information to write this number in. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=4953.355s">However,</a> I may continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=4956.521s">On</a> average, these absentee owners, they're collecting $2,000 a month rent. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=4965.005s">If</a> it's a two family, you're talking $48,000 in rents, even if they had an $800 increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=4973.509s">They're</a> still generating $48,000 and not living in our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=4981.932s">You,</a> the city councilors and the mayor, have before you an opportunity of a lifetime. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=4988.134s">If</a> you adopt Mass General Law, Chapter 59, Section 5C, the owner-occupied real estate tax exemption, the people would benefit greatly. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=5002.48s">Now,</a> I don't have all my information because of other circumstances that I had no control over. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=5013.39s">However,</a> I have a packet from the assessor's office that was given out a week ago, last Wednesday, and it states the communities and cities and towns that give out this owner-occupied exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=5030.664s">And</a> we're talking, as I said, Boston, Chelsea, Everett, Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=5037.082s">And</a> the numbers I'm seeing here that they're saving on real estate tax bills, like the lowest is like $1,400 a year, and that is in Chelsea. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=5048.234s">And</a> that is where the interim director of the assessor's office, Mr. Ken Stein, who's here this evening, <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=5056.642s">was</a> working in that department. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=5059.366s">And</a> I just found out this evening that the owner-occupied exemption was in effect prior to him working there in 1999. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=5069.398s">Wow,</a> this has been around since the millennium. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=5074.0s">This</a> is over 17 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=5075.881s">If</a> we're losing $1,000 a year for the average homeowner, and I'm talking nine out of 10, if you live in the house, that's 90%, 900% batting average. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=5083.904s">That's</a> incredible. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=5089.395s">And</a> furthermore, if that 10th person has an increase, it may indeed be less of an increase if we were not to adopt wonderful law that was thought up by our Massachusetts legislators. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=5104.302s">Finally,</a> they come up with a solution to keep maybe the seniors to be able to afford to live in their town. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=5115.187s">because</a> the real estate taxes are just too much for them to carry. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=5119.208s">And</a> furthermore, I don't

 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3926.455s">Yeah,</a> exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3928.076s">In</a> TB3. <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3929.596s">And</a> they put the high school here in the West Medford Woods. <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3933.752s">which</a> in effect was the kiss of death in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3937.035s">Then</a> the middle of Glen Mall was finally in the coffin. <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3940.237s">And</a> coincidentally, ironically, they went bankrupt, except for Wegmans, bail them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3945.381s">The</a> point is, we're repeating, we're not learning from history, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3950.665s">We're</a> repeating the same mistakes. <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3952.787s">We're</a> not putting it in a central location. <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3955.189s">Hopefully</a> you understand my point.<h2><a href="../2017-09-26_3rLlhNFiQKU/2017-09-26_3rLlhNFiQKU.html">Medford, MA City Council - Sep. 26, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3515.575s">Okay,</a> so there's a narrow margin in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3524.742s">Number</a> three, why did they only require approximately 1,700 signatures to get the CPA question on the ballot? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3539.558s">But</a> we, the average people or person, we need 20% of the registered voters, which is about approximately 7,000 signatures to get something on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3555.484s">And</a> also, I believe some people were involved with grabbing the petitions, worked for City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3563.787s">A</a> director of a certain department I noticed was involved.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3568.101s">I'm</a> not sure if that was legal. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3570.141s">Do</a> not be quiet about that right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3574.902s">Number</a> four, however, I'm not very upset at the extra $60 a year for my real estate tax bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3582.144s">I'm</a> more concerned I'm three real estate tax bills in arrears at the tune of $4,500 plus fine, plus 14% per annum juice interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3595.027s">Because</a> some of us are struggling to pay our bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3598.26s">Number</a> five, also I'm most concerned where most of this money will be spent, meaning outside of the West Medford area, we have South Medford, East Medford, Fulton Heights, and I believe these other areas have greater need to improve our quality of life, period. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3622.38s">And</a> finally, number six, <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3624.413s">And</a> of course, the so-called matching state funds was and is a fallacy, period, again. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3631.256s">Thank</a> you, if you're listening.<h2><a href="../2017-09-20_CtRL2YQa7iI/2017-09-20_CtRL2YQa7iI.html">Medford, MA City Council - Sep. 19, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9570.474s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9572.396s">Excuse</a> my appearance. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9573.236s">I</a> had a bad injury at the bike path that doesn't exist in the Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9580.107s">The</a> formula for a primary, I believe, is seven positions for the city council, which you all hold, times two is 14, add one is 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9588.871s">If</a> there's 15 or more candidates running, and there are, I believe, triggers a primary according to the city ordinance or charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9601.616s">Is</a> that accurate? <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9602.377s">That</a> is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9603.237s">Thank</a> you, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9609.264s">I,</a> when Mr. City Clerk Finn had the drawing for the post positions, I did sign as a council candidate for this election a so-called document, I believe all eight of us signed it, of the challenges, I should say. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9635.969s">And</a> that's the only document I ever signed to that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9639.972s">And</a> the document was stating, I believe, to let's waive the primary and save the taxpayers $30,000, $45,000, I hear sometimes $70,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9652.64s">I</a> don't know what the actual figure is. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9656.243s">So</a> I said, sure, it makes sense to me, common sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9660.702s">that</a> why spend 30 to 45,000 to eliminate one out of the 15? <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9668.026s">And</a> God forbid someone gets eliminated, if there is a primary, that person's not gonna feel very happy, I presume. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9677.171s">It</a> seems like a lot of big chunk of cash to eliminate one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9682.154s">However,</a> if you put it in perspective, as Councilor Marks was alluding to, <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9690.804s">45,000,</a> when this city spent, first of all, they collected from our pockets, the taxpayers, a billion dollars, over a billion dollars, not including the bonds they borrowed and extended our debt, the public debt. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9708.179s">And</a> from real perspective, I believe the 45,000, <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9715.851s">is</a> 2 hundredths of 1% of this year's $167 million budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9726.233s">Furthermore,</a> bottom line, this might be the best $45,000 this city has ever spent in 55 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9734.595s">It's</a> going to open up some conversation, I would think. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9737.335s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9738.115s">You're</a> welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9738.796s">I'm</a> not finished. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9742.236s">And</a> maybe we can get some leadership <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9745.721s">that</a> can improve our situation in the city and lower our real estate taxes, et cetera, et cetera, and improve the quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9757.807s">So</a> frankly, Charlotte, have the primary, don't have the primary, it might be a good thing to spend that $45,000 after all. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9765.791s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9766.531s">You're</a> quite welcome, sir.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10753.516s">Thank</a> you, Councilor, President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10756.878s">Part</a> of my appearance, I had a bad bicycle injury on Mystic River last Wednesday, right where the Clippership connected path is supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10766.785s">Unfortunately,</a> it's not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10768.085s">There's</a> a couple of sinkholes.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10771.888s">Yeah,</a> I noticed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10772.708s">I've</a> been through a thousand times. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10773.949s">I</a> get distracted, and it costs me dearly. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10777.111s">Head</a> injuries and broken bones. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10781.82s">If</a> I had some power in this, I would be the first on the agenda that I would take care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10787.663s">It's</a> public safety, not just that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10789.883s">Mystic</a> Avenue, cars that should not be parked there when five lanes becomes two lanes.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10796.046s">Yes,</a> we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10801.768s">In</a> a nutshell, Andrew Castagnetti, 23 Cushion Street, 781396. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10810.776s">TIPS,</a> T-I-P-S. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10814.259s">This</a> new growth, we've had this for many, many years, probably every year since pre-my birth. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10822.646s">However,</a> I don't understand why we don't use this new growth, which basically is real estate tax that never existed before from a development. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10836.791s">Why</a> don't they use that new growth to offset Prop 2.5 increases? <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10843.896s">Directly,</a> it should be directly applied to Prop 2.5 increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10850.301s">I</a> don't understand why. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10852.323s">Two</a> years ago, I did the math, my real estate tax bill went up $400. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10859.241s">if</a> they apply the $1.5 million of new growth, brand new real estate taxes against the 2.5%, which was $2.5 million, it would have went up $80 instead of $400. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10872.003s">And</a> this has been going on since before I was born. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10879.825s">Basically,</a> I believe this new growth, it should not be encouraged the way it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10887.507s">I'm</a> for smart growth, great economic growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10892.828s">However,</a> if you don't use that new real estate tax to offset two and a half increases, not only does it hurt us, it hurts us five fold. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10907.771s">First</a> of all, you need more fire, police, school teachers, buildings, vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10917.237s">and</a> infrastructure improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10920.298s">It</a> doesn't make sense to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10922.359s">I'm</a> asking if you could formally ask the mayor for an answer, a formal answer, because I've tried on my own with the head of the city assessor's office, and I have not received a straight answer, although I was told <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10945.175s">he</a> would mail me something that was three months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10948.196s">I</a> understand I'm not tech savvy. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10950.698s">Snail</a> mail can take time, but it's been three months. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10955.54s">Could</a> you please, can one councilor make a formal request to ask the mayor why aren't we using new growth to offset Prop 2.5 increases? <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10972.188s">Sure.</a> 
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10974.109s">Please.</a> 
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10975.83s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10977.01s">Who</a> will make that?

<a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16365.763s">That</a> is my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16367.385s">An</a> extreme concern here in 02155 and for all of the United States of America. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16373.678s">Number</a> two, for example, I must read two letters that were issued from the City of Medford Board of Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16383.901s">The</a> first letter was sent, I'm not sure of the date because it's not dated, from Mary Ann O'Connor, Director of the Board of Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16395.245s">It</a> states, the Board of Health recently voted to implement <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16400.07s">proposed</a> changes to Medford tobacco regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16403.692s">As</a> of July 10, 2017, the proposed changes will become effective. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16409.796s">And</a> in the bottom, it's directed towards private clubs. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16414.859s">Smoking</a> prohibited in private clubs slash memberships associations. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16421.162s">Another</a> letter was also sent out thereafter. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16424.604s">What</a> date, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16426.025s">It's</a> not dated, again. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16429.563s">Same</a> department, same director. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16432.325s">It</a> states, Board of Health notice to private clubs. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16436.088s">The</a> Medford Board of Health voted at the June meeting to postpone the enactment of the private club smoking ban for six months until after the next election. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16449.078s">Three,</a> it seems very undemocratic, you'd think. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16454.158s">Before</a> I continue, I'll disclose I am an officer at the Sons of Italy in Winchester, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16460.32s">And</a> yes, the club did ban smoking, November of 016. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16465.123s">However,</a> the private club membership voted amongst themselves in a democratic election period. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16471.087s">Furthermore,</a> the Winchester town government never dictated any such order. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16477.231s">And</a> also, our club did allow a special area for the people to go and enjoy their medicine, smoking. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16487.938s">With</a> thoughtful respect, thank you to the sons of Italy. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16491.5s">Number</a> five, look, we understand that smoking is a nasty addictive habit. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16496.382s">My</a> belief is nicotine is the most addictive drug on earth. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16501.465s">They</a> say smoking kills people and may indeed be killing me. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16505.167s">However,</a> did anyone ever think that this nicotine medicine kept me alive for 66 years? <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16511.93s">And</a> many others. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16513.477s">especially</a> U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16514.778s">soldiers</a> who are now veterans, a la VFW, American Legion, and more. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16521.984s">Six,</a> by the way, my point of factual information, when I started smoking in 1962, cigarettes was 28 cents a pack, the same price as a gallon of gasoline at Dick's Esso at Tufts Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16537.344s">OK,</a> so gas is now $2.10 a gallon. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16542.246s">But</a> a package of smokes is five times more than that in Texas. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16550.409s">Costing</a> the most addicted and poorest people in society more than $10 per package. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16558.813s">PS,</a> most of that $10 is federal, state, local taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16564.008s">hello,</a> if we all stop smoking, the government will lose billions in tax revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16571.373s">And</a> I don't even want to think how and what the government would tax to recoup the huge tax loss, especially with Proposition 2.5 in effect in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16584.282s">Thank</a> you, Barbara Anderson. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16586.543s">Rest</a> her soul. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16589.196s">6A,</a> please don't get too lost in what I just said. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16593.179s">But</a> at that time, I really felt that way, and I still do. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16599.524s">In</a> closing, sorry, I'm going to have to ad lib now. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16605.108s">Once,</a> I agree with the past councilor, President Robert Mayorko, when he once said, leave the people alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16621.455s">I</a> remember it because it was the only time I agreed with a man. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16628.402s">I'll</a> never forget it, but that never happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16632.406s">It</a> seems Big Brother, the government, has its own nasty habit. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16639.158s">of</a> putting their nose in people's private business. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16642.419s">Again,</a> again, and again. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16644.1s">It</a> is appalling to me and many other voters when our so-called leaders dictate to our VFW veterans of way too many wars, demanding that we cease from smoking in our private club. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16661.587s">This</a> is not fair and very undemocratic. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16666.114s">We,</a> the member peoples, are very capable to vote amongst ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16671.237s">Furthermore,</a> these fellow veterans who sacrificed life and limb and much more that I couldn't even comprehend, and we don't want to walk a mile on this show, I'm sure, unless you already have, you don't want to go back there, are the only reason we are not speaking German on the East Coast or Japanese on the West Coast and maybe even Mexican up to the Mason-Dixon line. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16696.446s">Number</a> nine, you know when I started kindergarten at the Hancock School, I no speak of the English at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16703.851s">I</a> spoke a Northern Italian dialect. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16706.353s">Eventually</a> I picked up your English as my second language without an ESL teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16713.097s">But</a> I do remember quite well those 50s teachers told me, this country is based on democracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16723.142s">However,</a> I've learned since then that this may be the biggest lie of all time, because it seems to be capitalism rules, and therefore trumps over our so-called democracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16738.866s">So</a> please, back off. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16742.827s">Leave</a> us alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16746.048s">And</a> finally, number 10, my fellow VFW members asked me to ask you all, will you stand on this matter now tonight, July 18th, 2017? <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16762.778s">This</a> is from seven minutes ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16764.379s">It's</a> 11.58.

 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16779.226s">My</a> fellow VFW members, including the top three, Commander Down, and in succession, they asked me to ask you all, where you stand on this matter now, tonight, <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16793.008s">before</a> the next general election. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16795.47s">Thank</a> you for listening.

 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=3011.273s">Castagnetti,</a> Andrew. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=3012.273s">The</a> man's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=3014.954s">Usually</a> when the city comes up with an idea, I'm not usually for it because it might cost us money or aggravation or a combination thereof sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=3024.218s">However,</a> I believe we in East Medford deserve this as a connection to West Medford all the way through to Assembly Road <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=3035.164s">so</a> I can continue my bike path. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=3040.148s">Also,</a> I must say, Route 93 got sound barriers on the west side, but the other child on my side, east forward, we never got any sound barriers. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=3052.119s">If</a> you're gonna give it to one child, you should give it to both childs, or else Paul did not bring any presents home whatsoever for Christmas. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=3060.707s">That's</a> only my opinion, of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=3063.907s">You're</a> welcome, Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=3067.47s">So</a> why not us in East Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=3072.814s">Besides,</a> there is a law, I believe it goes back to 1647, Cuomo of the Massachusetts, probably the oldest law in the 13 colonies, that states we the people have egress rights to walk along waterways, <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=3092.343s">up</a> to 20 feet, I believe, above high mean high tide. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=3099.068s">So</a> if properties were built close to the waterway, that's a nice amenity for them to have in the real estate business. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=3108.054s">However,</a> the Supreme Court also backed up this law on Cape Cod with Smith and Wesson's Peninsula down in Kituit. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=3118.622s">It's</a> the people's right of way. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=3122.064s">I</a> hope it goes forward as it should, as in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=3127.065s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6041.863s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6044.365s">Name</a> and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6045.725s">Andrew</a> Cast and Eddie Cushion Street, Method, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6050.728s">I'm</a> for historical preservation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6053.988s">As</a> a matter of fact, if I may tell you a short story, you might find it interesting, although most of the people behind me I'm sure know this story already. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6061.429s">I</a> lived in 41 Mystic Avenue for 25 years in a three family, which was originally a single family, that was originally next to Gaffey's, Captain Isaac Hall's house. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6080.132s">And</a> they moved that house, I have no idea when, <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6083.789s">before</a> I was born, where Governor Zav is today. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6089.134s">They</a> moved it, instead of destroying it, over 100 years ago, in order to make Governor Zav and you a reasonable facsimile of Commonwealth Avenue in Boston, from what I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6101.646s">How</a> they got it across the Karate Bridge, I have no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6105.569s">That</a> probably explains why those <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6109.884s">200-year-old</a> floors were sagging. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6112.245s">The</a> house was built in the 1750s, before Paul Revere. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6117.046s">Paul</a> Revere went right by it before they broke up and that's where the house was. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6121.087s">Captain</a> Isaac Hall had three sons, if I understand correctly, and I was the first of three sons. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6127.748s">I</a> won't get into the fact that they married three sisters from Cambridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6131.849s">However,</a> by the way, historical designation can be complicated, I'm sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6138.99s">I'm</a> sure there's different entities that classify it, whatever strength of power they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6143.111s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6143.911s">You</a> have the federal, you have state, city, and I presume there's others, including possibly Middlesex County that I'm not aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6152.734s">But</a> you should also consider the new growth as not anti-American, especially if we can fix up some blighted properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6169.6s">And</a> as far as gentrification, as the lady had spoken earlier, I don't believe we would have much gentrification, even if real estate taxes, the real estate values, the prices, valuations went up drastically. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6184.627s">But</a> if you don't use that new growth from the new development to offset Prop 2.5 increases, then we will be pushed out, especially seniors on fixed income. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6199.092s">or</a> zero income for the last 29 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6202.754s">Just</a> wanted to volunteer a story from my childhood.

 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6100.703s">Andrew</a> Castagnetti, Cushion Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6105.447s">It's</a> hard to follow Dr. Starella, he's so eloquent. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6112.553s">And</a> my education is not so good, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6116.537s">From</a> Tuspac, I was educated at Woodstock, and I went to BU once. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6121.381s">I</a> did go to BU once, Boston University I think it's called, but it was closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6127.866s">However,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6129.321s">What</a> really fries my backside is this new growth that's projected at about $1.5 million, it is not, never has been deducted from Prop 2.5 before you raise the real estate tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6156.052s">If</a> it did last year, the $1.7 million, <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6160.65s">of</a> new growth deducted that first from the two and a half percent of 100 million, two and a half million, you would have had like $800,000 increase instead of two, three, $4 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6181.404s">Approximately,</a> I would say, <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6188.465s">The</a> real estate tax was never going up like $400. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6190.466s">It</a> probably would have went up $80. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6192.608s">Probably</a> would have saved 80% on the tax increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6199.633s">I</a> don't know why it's not being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6204.497s">Furthermore,</a> I don't understand why we can't do what Somerville, Everett, Malden does, Boston, Brookline, and I believe Martha's Vineyard. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6217.418s">to</a> give the owner-occupied who live in their one home, doesn't matter if it's a condo, single, two, three family, or 100 family, marauder home, doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6228.547s">They're</a> all gonna get the same 20% exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6232.49s">Actually,</a> now I'm talking, since it's never been done here, 35% to make it worthwhile. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6239.436s">So</a> no one's real estate tax will go up, even if you live in it, because the cap would be <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6247.587s">much</a> higher than last year's projected $600,000 or thereabouts, it'll go up to $1 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6254.191s">And</a> if it does go up, because you live in a house that's valued over $1 million, it's going to be a minuscule increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6260.936s">And</a> don't forget, at 20%, if that was adopted, it would have been, I don't know, <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6277.537s">I'm</a> losing track because it's highly unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6282.078s">And</a> I kind of understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6283.859s">And</a> if you give the city more money, even on the side, I'm sure they'll take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6291.16s">But</a> Dr. Sorella brings up some good points. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6294.501s">I</a> still understand why we don't use that new growth, because the new growth, we might as well not have it because we don't need more congestion in East Ford, South Medford, because <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6306.174s">They</a> don't help the real estate tax because it's been carrying the load for decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6311.058s">They</a> hurt us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6312.779s">Need</a> more police, more fire, schools, school teachers, infrastructure, things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6323.126s">So</a> where does that come from? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6325.648s">We</a> need more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6327.55s">And</a> the real estate tax, thanks to Barbara Anderson, rest her soul, is about two and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6333.714s">But</a> like Dr. Stirella says, <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6335.405s">last</a> year's increase or his projected increase for 2018 will be like over 4%. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6340.026s">So</a> that's a fallacy also, Prop 2.5. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6345.588s">How</a> much more can you tax the lower middle class? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6348.028s">I</a> really don't care too much for rich people, and I'm not really in the poor people's corner either. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6354.73s">I'm</a> for the lower middle class, because without the lower middle class, which is the majority, you're not gonna have a society worth a damn, and I repeat, <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6364.068s">and</a> it might be time for a second revolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6367.209s">That's</a> how this country was founded when we threw out the English. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6371.711s">Give</a> him a break. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6374.211s">Please,</a> help the taxpayer, the average person, please help them for a change, just once.<h2><a href="../2017-04-04_43IdaIBcFp0/2017-04-04_43IdaIBcFp0.html">Medford, MA City Council - Apr. 4, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3107.55s">Name</a> and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3112.072s">Andrew</a> Castagnetti, Cushman street, Method, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3115.874s">Great</a> to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3117.727s">vocational</a> training for our local students in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3121.75s">As</a> a matter of fact, it seems it's way overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3128.595s">From</a> what I understand, a lot of corporations that are here, the Raytheons and GEs, they cannot find enough qualified students, especially coming out of high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3141.264s">So</a> I was kind of surprised to hear that the Minuteman bill was <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3146.502s">I</a> believe the awards were up to a million dollars on one annual basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3152.347s">And</a> I understand and I've heard for many years if it's true that some other communities send their students here, such as Everett and others maybe. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3164.517s">And</a> I was just curious if it's $20,000 or $30,000 to send our children to Minuteman, <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3172.675s">times</a> 20-something, whatever, became a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3175.717s">I</a> was just wondering, if you put it on a scale, how much did we acquire by renting out vocational and teachers to other students? <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3185.745s">How</a> much per year and what that total was compared to up to the million dollars? <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3193.651s">One</a> other addendum, if I could recollect. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3198.275s">Yes,</a> I recollect. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3199.536s">Thank</a> you for your patience. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3200.677s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3201.869s">On</a> the motion by- May I just finish one- I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3204.61s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3206.431s">I</a> would hope it would be automatic that in the future, even the present, that the Medford High School vocational school would be on a first term, first basis to satisfy all of our local students that live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3231.563s">before</a> we start renting it out and charging and making monies from other students. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3238.405s">So</a> to the chair, I'd like to know, on a scale of a million dollars, minute man versus how much we charged and how much per student we charge, and also if there'd be a guarantee that to make sure that our students would have first preference over any aliens that might come in from other cities.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4310.056s">Thank</a> you, Honorable Caraviello Presidents. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4313.079s">Andrew</a> Kast and Eddie Cushing Street in Medford, Mass., <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4316.0s">And</a> I want to thank Councilor Marks and Brianna and other Councilors for bringing up this situation at the Wellington Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4325.686s">In</a> my opinion, it's well over 20 years overdue that the state itself, I would think, should have at least put some bridges or tunnels, water permitting, et cetera, as they did on McGrath Highway and other sections towards Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4345.454s">Unfortunately,</a> it has not been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4347.135s">And</a> meanwhile, since 20 years ago or 30 years ago, they closed the Meadowland Drive and the Wellington Trenton Drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4356.299s">We</a> have multiple apartment buildings left and right. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4360.561s">And</a> we have Wegmans about to open. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4363.863s">We</a> have Station Landon. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4365.784s">Then</a> we have Assembly Road is probably only 5% developed, mind you. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4370.146s">I'm</a> just guesstimating. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4372.905s">And</a> I think the casino's supposed to draw 17,000 cars per whatever, which sounds like a big number. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4381.867s">So</a> it's unfair, especially to these two Councilors who do business or live in that neighborhood also. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4392.21s">And</a> it affects my wife going to Market Basket in Chelsea. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4398.212s">In</a> the name of Medford traffic safety, however, <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4402.647s">I</a> saw Mr. Gav in this resolution, and I wanted to bring up something. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4409.272s">And</a> in the name of Medford Public's traffic safety, again, I want to notify 02155 of two dangerous traffic locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4426.046s">Number</a> one is at Route 38, which is Mystic Avenue, the old highway to Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4433.609s">heading</a> north from Harvard Street towards Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4437.83s">There's</a> five lanes on that highway going towards Atlas Liquors. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4444.611s">And</a> there's no parking on either side of that state road. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4448.992s">And</a> then the five lanes reduces to only two lanes directly across the street of 141 Mystic Avenue, which has a sign on that building saying, <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4463.492s">David's</a> auto repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4466.674s">For</a> lack of better words, it's a real goat's F of a situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4470.236s">There's</a> been many accidents there, and I've seen cars turn over, and I've seen people get into wheelchairs and not walk again. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4481.141s">So,</a> all of a sudden, when you hit Atlas, there's an ambiguous sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4489.406s">Left</a> lane's supposed to take a left onto Hancock Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4492.627s">And</a> the other lane, there's an arrow where it says only, but good luck if you can try to configure what that means. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4500.251s">And</a> then there's also a sign where it says crosswalk, and it has a big, beautiful yellow sign, brand new, and it shows a crosswalk with two people, caricatures crossing. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4514.019s">However,</a> wouldn't you know, there's three vehicles parked on the right-hand side at David's Auto Repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4523.182s">a</a> dangerous, dangerous situation, especially when vehicles sometimes are doing well over 40, maybe 50 or 60 miles per hour, and a lot of them are outsiders, they don't know about that left onto Hancock Street, and it reduces, I repeat, from five lanes to two lanes, and all of a sudden there's three cars parked on the right, and they're SUVs, and you can't see over them, especially if you're a pedestrian wanting to cross <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4550.192s">the</a> old civilization to cross the street to 141. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4552.694s">It's</a> very dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4553.915s">That's</a> not the only one, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4557.658s">I</a> hope we get resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4558.939s">I</a> brought this up at the police station, at their meetings, and a couple of officers said they would look into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4566.325s">I'm</a> not sure if it's already been ratified. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4572.29s">I'm</a> not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4573.471s">But</a> the last time I was out last week, I did see the three vehicles still there. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4578.05s">Whether</a> they're legally parked or illegally parked, I don't know, but common sense says you're looking for another bad accident. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4586.214s">The</a> second one is also a dangerous intersection, and it's my neck of the woods in East Ford. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4593.697s">At</a> Park Street, as you're coming down Park Street onto Riverside Avenue, you cannot see over that left house on the end, which is number one Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4607.787s">It</a> has a corner wooden fence, which causes an obstructed view. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4612.33s">Again,</a> there's been many, many accidents there. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4615.533s">Some</a> police officers have told me, good luck, because it'd be nice to get rid of that fence. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4621.016s">And</a> I'm not saying to do it in eminent domain, but maybe you could ask the resident if they'd be willing to allow me to cut the top half of that fence down at my cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4634.286s">I'd</a> be happy to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4636.007s">Two</a> dangerous situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4637.642s">And</a> the third one I've already covered before, and that was the Roosevelt Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4646.287s">Was</a> it Roosevelt? <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4648.128s">Yeah,</a> Wellington I talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4650.789s">That's</a> the bridge that should have been there 20 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4653.071s">Roosevelt</a> Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4654.391s">As</a> you're coming from Medford Square, going on to Exit 33, it may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4660.575s">But</a> you're going towards that first rotary before you get to the Rice Pond turnoff, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4667.173s">But</a> anyway, around that rotary, there's a lot of overgrown trees, it seems, that are wild. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4672.517s">But</a> I think in the last year or so, they've been cutting them down. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4675.299s">Another</a> dangerous location, because they're really flying around that rotary, and a lot of accidents happen at that rotary also. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4682.244s">So</a> I don't want to give you more than three today. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=4685.246s">Thank</a> you for listening.<h2><a href="../2017-03-30_Ekl5AjaSUkg/2017-03-30_Ekl5AjaSUkg.html">Medford, MA City Council - Mar. 28,

 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=2443.396s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=2444.596s">Andrew</a> Castagnetti, Cushing Street Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=2446.617s">Thank</a> you, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=2447.737s">Appreciate</a> your attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=2449.937s">Thought</a> I'd share some information about this gas leak situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=2454.598s">Approximately</a> 15 years ago, my wife said there was a gas leak in front of the house, but I couldn't tell. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=2462.379s">She</a> can smell a cigarette from a mile away, but I really can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=2466.6s">So,</a> sure enough, a gas employee, National Grid, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=2472.768s">came</a> in front of the house and I didn't notice my new tree on Cushion Street was dwarfed and it looked like it was dying compared to the others that were newly planted. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=2486.131s">Anyways,</a> across the street, they had gone through multiple trees about number 26 Cushion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=2495.433s">So</a> the guest gentleman said to me, listen, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=2499.815s">This</a> is, I thought he said stage one, stage two, stage three, or I said grade, you said stage, whatever it is, there's one, two, and three. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=2509.42s">I'm</a> not sure which was the worst. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=2511.181s">I'm</a> sure you counsel much, you know better. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=2514.163s">And</a> your mind is refreshed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=2516.664s">However,</a> he said it was not so bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=2520.767s">Okay,</a> so he also says to me, don't say I said it, so I'm not quoting his name, I probably have it in my notes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=2528.989s">He</a> said, Medford is known as the gassy city, kind of like Shark Bay. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=2533.85s">And</a> I said, I presume it has nothing to do with Boston baked beans, mind you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=2538.492s">So,</a> and I've been seeing them walking around and driving around with their scanners and snifters, whatever they hang from their bumpers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=2548.435s">And</a> sure enough, they did come and replace the whole main for the entire street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=2555.137s">And</a> we've been fortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=2556.677s">We</a> have new infrastructure on that street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=2561.507s">And</a> they replanted new trees, because they also did the sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=2567.932s">And</a> our tree in the front seems a little bit more dwarfed than the other one we have on the front, which is more on the Abbott's corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=2577.4s">And</a> across the street, where they already went through three trees prior to the replacement of the new line, their tree looks more dwarfed than mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=2587.288s">I</a> would say it's ready to go to De La Ruza's pretty soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=2591.618s">So</a> I think I covered the information I'd like to share. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=2600.545s">And</a> just think, these pipes are probably 100 years old or more, give or take 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=2608.731s">God</a> forbid, if we ever had to do entire re-digging the infrastructure, I don't think this country could afford such a thing and the inconvenience. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=2621.062s">So</a> I guess we're gonna have to do a piecemeal when it becomes a stage one, as you say, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=2627.507s">But</a> I wanna re-quote this gentleman, just don't quote me, but Medford is known as the gassy city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=2636.753s">That's</a> all I have to offer.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=2994.895s">Andrew,</a> Cushing Street, Method Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=2998.573s">I</a> appreciate Councilor Knight's concern about keeping a more of a Winchester-type atmosphere versus a Chelsea-type atmosphere. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=3007.536s">It's</a> a great thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=3009.517s">Glad</a> you respect the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=3012.238s">It</a> seems to me most people in the world, including in our community, are good people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=3018.26s">However,</a> there are some that have issues, and maybe they do bad things, and I'm not sure if we can, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=3026.527s">Someone</a> can dictate, even through an ordinance, and you probably can, but to whether they should have grates or not, especially if they're carrying 24-karat gold bullion or jewelry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=3037.912s">I'm</a> not sure about ice cream parlors. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=3040.473s">However,</a> I think in order to avoid possibly more of the secondhand shops and <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=3053.892s">massage</a> parlors, which kept Medford hopping until after eight o'clock at night, but they had to go, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=3060.714s">But</a> they had to roll up the sidewalks at 4 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=3062.995s">at</a> least. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=3064.575s">However,</a> all kidding aside, I believe it's more important for the leadership in this city to make better amends to beautify our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=3081.486s">and</a> at least clean up the trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=3083.407s">I</a> know it's not Winchester, but I fear it might become like the communities on the East Coast as night is implying it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=3093.25s">So</a> behind Mystic River Bend Park, for example, that parking lot, and I've said it to many people, leaders in this community, it's insane. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=3108.654s">It's</a> like a war zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=3111.483s">You</a> have these cement things that's supposed to stop the cars from hitting the curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=3115.644s">Well,</a> they've been plowed over and broken in half, and you have rebar sticking up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=3120.225s">I'm</a> afraid someone's gonna end up in a wheelchair. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=3125.606s">And</a> there's a lot of debris back there, and it's just, that's only one location. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=3132.168s">I</a> guess, what's the name? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=3133.588s">Aretha</a> Franklin, R-E-S. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=3136.249s">Respect</a> the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=3139.55s">Do</a> something. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=3142.688s">Besides</a> the great work you're doing, we gotta have respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=3148.433s">I</a> don't mind picking up papers in the street, pieces of plywood in Medford Square, on Salem Street, Riverside Ave, but what am I gonna put in my pocket? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=3159.082s">The</a> city could do a better job, although DPW employees have a shortage of manpower, in my estimation, and <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=3171.008s">They're</a> tired after a snowstorm, and instead of spending money for the high execs, maybe we should hire a few Indians, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=3183.791s">Use</a> some of that free cash to clean up the neighborhood, and maybe people will stop throwing their chewing gum wrappers on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ekl5AjaSUkg&t=3192.273s">Just</a> thinking out loud, sir.

 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=3224.21s">No,</a> Ricky, I hope to make a God willing, but on the other hand, <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=3231.093s">This</a> is a great city and a lot of what in a lot of ways really is by we live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=3237.637s">Location</a> is incredible. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=3241.6s">However,</a> we're an underachiever by far. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=3245.563s">I</a> can agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=3247.564s">We</a> got to cut this stuff out. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=3250.346s">One</a> side of Mr. Gav should all be 25 stories high. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=3253.028s">35</a> years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=3254.569s">One</a> side only with a ring road. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=3256.73s">Keep</a> them off main street. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=3257.711s">They</a> don't want to go to the old deepest qualities. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=3260.375s">If</a> you worked here, you'd be at work now. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=3262.016s">As</a> Sloan took my idea 10 years ago for his billboard. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=3267.498s">The</a> location is incredible. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=3269.438s">Councilor</a> Baxter was right. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=3270.499s">Why</a> would you want to put that kind of a Springstead building in front of the city hall and block our view? <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=3277.401s">Why</a> don't we have phase two from the Green Line if the squeaky wheel Tufts University ever gets their subway stop? <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=3284.924s">Or</a> why don't phase two, instead of redundantly go to the west side of town, <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=3289.748s">The</a> squeaky wheels already have the commuter line. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=3293.49s">Malden</a> Center has downtown subway. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=3296.272s">Winchester</a> Center has it above ground, mind you, in the town of Winchester. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=3300.434s">Well,</a> why not have it come from Tufts when they eventually get it? <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=3305.437s">If</a> it's not double over the budget and underground as the crow flies three quarters of a mile and no eminent domain at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=3317.123s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=3317.814s">You</a> have Emerge right behind you, Councilor Rick, at the Redbrick Building, that I would take by eminent domain, because I don't go to the dentist there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=3331.457s">And</a> I would have a subway entrance right there, and this is not Andrew Castagnetti's idea, this is Mr. Dick Ober's idea, retired electrical engineer, and he used to take care of Chevalier, like the Phantom of the Opera. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=3346.867s">It's</a> his idea, it's not Andrew's idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=3349.108s">And</a> furthermore, I would add a tour clipper ship on the river, and you could chauffeur in tourists from all over the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=3358.972s">10,000</a> a day with pockets full of Japanese yen, euro, whatever, and put us back on the map, because we built clipper ships. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=3367.995s">Over</a> 50 was longer than Edgley Field of Dreams. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=3372.437s">It's</a> incredible. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=3374.27s">So,</a> and who would pay for this subway underground? <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=3378.373s">Not</a> Mexico. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=3379.573s">Have</a> Tufts pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=3382.195s">Good</a> night.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8104.128s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8104.588s">Councilor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8105.048s">President</a> Caraviello, Andrew Castagnetti, Cushing street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8109.949s">Um,</a> this insurance stuff for the lack of a better word is way over my head. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8118.781s">And</a> I can understand why they have the tallest building in Boston and Hartford, Connecticut, and stable of attorneys working in their buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8129.444s">I</a> don't know what happened here, but if I'm not mistaken, I had read a political leader's statement in the local newspaper, the transcript, some six years ago, thereabouts, saying if we select <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8148.817s">the</a> GIC insurance versus what we had, what I have from my wife, we're a school teacher and was tough total health. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8157.179s">I</a> believe that we was, we counseled Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8162.68s">I</a> believe the top leader was quoted in six years ago that we were going to save $5 million annually exalted. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8173.241s">Well,</a> the 5 million seems to be exalted also per annum. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8177.328s">times</a> 6.5 years, maybe. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8180.949s">I</a> don't understand what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8182.41s">If</a> we save $5 million a year, first of all, I told my wife, I don't need her master's degree to figure out for such a great deal in savings through the Corporation of Massachusetts, GIC, that I said, you watch. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8202.378s">The</a> co-pays, the doctor's visits, <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8208.731s">And</a> the monthly costs will be going up again after the 6.5 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8214.854s">But</a> I don't see the $5 million savings. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8219.637s">Did</a> our real estate taxes go down? <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8223.299s">No,</a> probably went up $2.5 million per year for the last five years, approximate. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8229.382s">So,</a> that's a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8233.985s">$5</a> million savings, not having to spend the extra $5 million on health insurance, <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8238.811s">for</a> the city itself, yeah, that's $32 million totaled at the end of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8246.696s">And</a> our real estate tax is going up in that time span, probably at least 2 million times 6, 12 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8253.26s">So</a> that's like a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8255.722s">It's</a> like $50 million we're talking, but yet we don't even save a dime in real estate taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8261.821s">And</a> furthermore, our new growth is never applied to offset the Prop 2.49% increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8270.145s">So</a> what good is this new growth? <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8273.026s">It</a> doesn't help our city.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8278.648s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8279.209s">Not</a> real estate. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8280.789s">And</a> the cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8282.91s">Okay,</a> so it all comes down to health insurance, $5 million a year savings. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8288.373s">Can</a> someone educate me and show me where that money went? <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8292.297s">and</a> we never even adopted the owner-occupied real estate taxes exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8296.559s">The</a> point is we say $5 million a year, real estate taxes go up $2 million a year, something is amiss. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8304.722s">Can</a> someone help me as I pay thousands of dollars every year for real estate tax, can someone tell me where this money went? <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8313.426s">Someone,</a> anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8316.347s">What</a> do we get? <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8318.948s">Somebody,</a> does anybody know where the money went? <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8324.725s">Councilor</a> Dello Russo says aye. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8326.265s">Did</a> he get the money? <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8327.606s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8327.906s">He</a> may have. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8328.266s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8328.726s">I</a> can't answer that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8329.606s">I</a> don't understand.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8333.587s">Thank</a> you for answering my question.<h2><a href="../2017-01-13_HLZVJwxP68w/2017-01-13_HLZVJwxP68w.html">Medford, MA City Council - Jan. 10, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2752.048s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2758.989s">Uh,</a> Andrew cast and Eddie Cushion street method. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2761.231s">Mass.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2762.271s">Um,</a> first of all, congratulations belatedly to council president. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2765.813s">Mr.</a> Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2766.874s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2769.296s">And</a> vice president Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2771.137s">Congratulations</a> on this subject of our traffic and parking in the name of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2781.583s">Bear</a> with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2782.103s">A</a> few things came to my head and didn't have a chance to write them down. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2785.857s">But</a> I believe Karen DiLorenzo Pop, the community developer, I believe, for the city, I questioned her about Route 16 and 93 way back, and she said, what's the point of time? <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2800.427s">There</a> was funds for that, but for whatever reason, it's not done. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2805.39s">Meaning,</a> coming down 93 South, heading into Method Square's exit 32, which is like 32 ounces at a quart, that's why I remember it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2816.251s">So</a> when you get that at exit, it says, I presume rule 16 cause I don't pay attention cause I know the neighborhoods, but I believe it's probably rule 16 exit west to go to the dentist office in Arlington or wherever, but they have to go through method square and they're not buying a cup of coffee. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2834.266s">So</a> there's a lot of congestion for that reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2838.409s">So</a> if indeed the state had earmarked that money's to have when they built with 93 1960, <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2845.733s">they</a> should have came behind you city hall after the method square exit and then go around the senior citizen and go to 16 West directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2859.137s">That's</a> only my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2863.578s">Uh,</a> also I was at the sub method police meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2867.42s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2868.28s">Councilor</a> Falco for bringing the show on the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2871.041s">The</a> fourth thought of four on the compass rose and <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2876.198s">I</a> kind of laid into Chief Sacco a little bit about what I call, for lack of better words, a goat's F of a situation on Mystic Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2885.141s">There's</a> three cars parked right after Atlas as you're coming in towards the square, and it never should have been parked there ever, in my opinion, because five lanes becomes only one lane going south after you pass Atlas. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2900.366s">And</a> all of a sudden, from zero cars parked on both sides, I presume it's a state road, <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2906.905s">There's</a> three cars parked across from 141 Mystic Ave, which is David's Auto Repair and Ravello's Tin Knockin', whatever it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2918.61s">And</a> if I wanted to presume when you gave them the license, whenever that was, either one of those, I'm sure you Councilors questioned them about parking vehicles on the street, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2929.674s">I</a> would think common sense, but I don't recollect for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2933.796s">So</a> anyways, that's a real GOAT situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2937.235s">And</a> I noticed, I didn't go out Thursday after the Wednesday meeting, but I went out Friday and I noticed those three vehicles were not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2944.277s">And</a> I have an index card, I've been listing them for over a month, and two of the vehicles have been there over five times on different days. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2955.36s">And</a> it's just during business hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2958.521s">Anyways,</a> I'm tired of seeing a lot of accidents there. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2961.562s">I'm</a> tired of seeing cars being rolled over in accidents. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2964.803s">Tired</a> of seeing injuries at that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2967.933s">and</a> hopefully there'll be less accidents for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2973.534s">So</a> if I may, I want to come in chief circle and his offices again, Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2981.296s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2983.997s">But</a> I'm here to speak about one thing originally and that is we're talking about traffic safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2993.919s">Method</a> Square is not really a square. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2995.88s">We</a> get a lot of situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=2997.513s">As</a> Councilor Knight, I believe, mentioned, we have three, four, five state roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3003.516s">However,</a> when developers come into this city, I'm worried about parking because if there's parking, then there's less of a road to drive upon also. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3016.163s">But</a> I don't understand, for example, at the end of this month, according to the legal notices and the method transcript, on January 31st, I believe, <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3027.473s">Board</a> of Appeals is having two businesses or two landowners, I should say, LLCs, whatever they are, that are adjoining each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3039.856s">And</a> they want to build condominiums or apartments, I believe, or condominiums. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3045.437s">And</a> I'm not against development, especially smart development, even though it doesn't help the real estate taxpayers because you don't <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3056.1s">deduct</a> that first from prop two and a half increases and it works against us. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3061.663s">It's</a> a, it's called the, uh, the annuity that keeps on giving as a Russian lady used to say, but I won't get into that right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3070.489s">However,</a> according to this various requests amongst height restrictions and this and that, I

 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2748.151s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Dello Russo, Andrew Castagnetti, Cushing Street, Medford Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2752.213s">I</a> also commend all the people involved that want to better the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2756.776s">In</a> the past, I've said it numerous times, if you need something, the city needs it, but they should do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2766.021s">My</a> only concern is these buildings are not that old, such as the police station, the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2774.585s">And</a> actually, they're younger than I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2776.909s">and</a> it doesn't seem right that they're in such disrepair that they have to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2785.055s">Saying</a> that, we have over probably 10,000 houses in this city that are made of wood frame, and they seem to be in fine standing order. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2795.463s">Chevrolet</a> Auditorium, I believe, was built in 1939, according to Dee, and I think Method High School on Forest Street, the old one, I believe, was built in the 1800s. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2805.583s">So</a> it seems to me we have a problem with maintenance and I just don't want to see us spend millions and down the road our children are going to be saddled in another 50 years with billion dollar buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2821.114s">That's</a> my only concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2822.635s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3942.853s">Season's</a> greetings.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3944.894s">First</a> off, I'd be remiss after receiving some information finally from the assessor's office not to <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3952.526s">mentioned</a> this calculation that I did on my own time, hopefully would benefit the middle class real estate taxpayer in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3964.751s">I'll</a> make it very brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3966.752s">Finally,</a> I received all the information pertaining to last week's real estate tax rate meeting, and I did a fair sample calculation to compare what the average real estate tax bill for the year would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3981.183s">if</a> we had adopted the 20% owner occupied real estate tax exemption based on the average home value here in 02155, which is 485,000 times $10 and 50 something cents would be 5,122. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3993.112s">And</a> with the 20% exemption, the 485, you would take away 20% of the value, which is 97,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4010.563s">You</a> have therefore a sum of 388,000 times, much higher rate from 1050 to 1240s, but it's 4,800 and change. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4021.869s">The</a> bottom line is the average home of a home that lives in it would save $307 a year if the 20% exemption was adopted. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4032.994s">But</a> in reality, the average single family will be building extra $280 increase next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4040.635s">Therefore</a> also 11,000 out of the 12,000 owner occupied homeowners who actually live in their house will miss out on this huge real estate savings. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4052.465s">If</a> we only had adopted the Commonwealth of Massachusetts general law chapter 59 section five C which offers us middle class real estate tax relief. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4067.078s">This</a> 300 to <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4068.883s">possibly</a> $600 real estate tax savings for the average homeowner would have been a nice Christmas gift for the first time ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4077.905s">As</a> I say in baseball, wait until next year unless somebody wants to discuss the matter right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4083.926s">Thank</a> you for saying no. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4086.446s">Furthermore,</a> if I may ad lib this, problem number two we have, in my opinion, you may remember the lovely Russian lady brought this issue to this honorable body. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4098.873s">years</a> ago, but I never understood it until now. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4102.795s">Now</a> I get it proposition two and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4106.237s">Thank</a> you to Barbara Anderson. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4107.818s">Rest</a> her soul limits the tax levy, which is about a hundred million dollars last year to two and a half percent increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4115.702s">So</a> that's about two and a half million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4118.124s">However,</a> the new growth that we generated was 1.8 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4125.087s">The</a> city always goes up to the max within a hair. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4128.807s">which</a> is $2.5 million, the new growth is $1.8 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4132.969s">And</a> those are new buildings that just come out of nowhere to generate the extra $1.8 million of new real estate tax that never existed prior. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4143.515s">Never.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4145.196s">So</a> the Russian lady made a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4147.497s">In</a> reality, take away a $2.5 million increase from Prop 2.5, and the new growth was $1.8 million, the increase should have been $700,000, period, <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4158.487s">versus</a> 4.2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4161.168s">That's</a> like seven times. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4164.389s">So</a> we could have saved maybe, instead of a $300 average increase, maybe it would have been like 50 bucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4172.731s">But</a> I'm not a math scientist, but the math seems to tell the facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4179.113s">I'm</a> not sure who was responsible for this injustice. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4183.334s">By</a> not first deducting the new growth, <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4187.723s">from</a> the Prop 2.5 increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4192.085s">As</a> she used to say, it's like an annuity that keeps on giving. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4196.046s">And</a> then the 2.5% is based on the following year on a higher number, and we don't get any tax relief. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4205.149s">Not</a> only that, we get hurt because we have to pay more police cars, more fire trucks, more schooling, more teachers, <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4220.123s">I</a> don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4220.824s">That's</a> my story and I'm sticking to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4227.028s">In</a> closing, if I may say, wishing some of you a merry Christmas and a happy Hanukkah and to all a good night.<h2><a

<a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1634.737s">Go</a> to Commonwealth Massachusetts website referred to mass general laws chapter 59 section five C one Massachusetts cities are <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1644.515s">already</a> presently given this real estate tax savings to its owner-occupied homeowners. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1650.877s">This</a> includes three bordering cities, Malden, Everett, and Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1654.938s">My</a> question is, why not here in Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1658.359s">For</a> the past 40 or more years, our real estate tax bill in Medford has increased over 2.5 percent per year. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1668.543s">If</a> this automatic 20 percent exemption outlined in <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1674.023s">Chapter</a> 59, Section 5C, is adopted, the average owner-occupied homeowner, if you live on that one house, would receive a $200 savings a year instead of the usual $200 increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1688.912s">That's</a> a $400 swing times 12,000 owner-occupieds. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1695.616s">Those</a> are tens of millions of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1699.419s">Again,</a> I am asking, why not here in this city?

To this day, I have not received any responses in writing to the transcript or to me personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1747.678s">It</a> just seems to me that this is way past due to give our middle class some tax relief for the first time ever in my lifetime that I know of. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1759.305s">The</a> $650,000 push <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1762.603s">valuation</a> would be slight increases above that with the adoption of what I'm talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1771.853s">And</a> below that, they would all save money. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1776.819s">In</a> a nutshell, they would save $200 to $300, not having today's numbers, of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1785.73s">And</a> opposed to the opposite direction, so you're talking like $500 to $600 swing difference, again, times 12,000 owner-occupied. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1792.973s">That's</a> tens of millions of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1797.555s">It</a> seems kind of sad to me that we cannot help the middle class, because the middle class, in my day, as a youth, dad worked, mom stood home, took care of the kids, and bought a house, saved money, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1815.99s">Today,</a> if both people are working at what kind of job, I don't know, whatever benefits they may not have, they can't have a hard time paying their bills, let alone saving. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1833.016s">So</a> if the middle class is going to continue in this direction, on one shoulder, they carry the rich that don't want to pay taxes or refuse to. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1846.412s">And</a> then on the other shoulder, they're carrying citizens or non-citizens who are getting checks from federal government, who can work, but maybe refuse to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1863.416s">So</a> if you collapse the middle class, I believe common sense would dictate that we wouldn't have a society worth a damn. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1874.778s">And</a> then? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1875.677s">there</a> might be the second revolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1882.342s">Maybe</a> Bernie Sanders made a good point once upon a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1886.145s">He</a> was telling me about this so-called rigged system. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1891.749s">And</a> I remember one astute individual once said, we can have democracy in this country, or we can have a few capitalists control most of the wealth, but we can't have both.

 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7870.056s">Yes,</a> Andrew Castagnetti, Cushing Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7873.268s">Thank</a> you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7874.989s">Uh,</a> I'm not privy to much of this information, so I, I really don't have any comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7882.954s">However,</a> if a supermarket overcharges me $2 for an item, my shopping cart, it'd be nice to get that $2 back with treble damages, mind you. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7896.322s">And</a> also if, if, if, if some entity is charging me, the homeowner, <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7902.285s">a</a> water bill in excessive totality of $8 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7908.049s">I</a> would like to see that gave them back to the customer also. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7914.213s">Um,</a> and furthermore, what I don't understand is this tier one, tier two and tier three, I believe is designated for tier one, one family, two family, three family, <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7929.381s">It's</a> based on consumption, actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7931.243s">It's</a> an assumption? <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7932.223s">Consumption.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7933.324s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7933.744s">It's</a> a general ballpark number they go by, if I recollect without having a water bill in front of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7940.73s">However,</a> then there's the un-tiered rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7945.773s">And</a> I presume un-tiered has nothing to do with one, two, or three family homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7952.058s">It's</a> most likely commercial, businesses, General Electric, Metal Grimm Mall. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7961.004s">business</a> establishments. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7963.406s">However,</a> that commercial rate, I'd like to call it, sir, is lower than a three family rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7974.653s">So</a> I think the people are getting it and not so nice ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7979.176s">I</a> still, and I brought this up numerous times in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7985.44s">Good</a> luck.

Castagnetti, Cushion Street, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=2048.649s">I</a> don't have much to add to the pains in Salt and Method for the parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=2055.479s">I</a> do feel that pain, however, because although I've been out of there for 36 years, I used to live in Mystic Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=2062.844s">That</a> was the old Route 93 to Boston before they built Route 93 in 1960. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=2067.567s">It</a> wasn't a picnic back then when there's more cars, obviously, these days. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=2079.155s">I</a> would like to advise to a word of caution for future excavations of the problems for future parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=2088.319s">It</a> may become even more of a nightmare if the board of appeals allows developers to not meet their 2.1 parking spots per residential unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=2104.546s">I</a> would find it hard to issue an invariance <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=2108.231s">to</a> not require the 2.1, which maybe we could even increase the three or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=2116.139s">Just</a> a word of caution. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=2117.901s">Thank</a> you for listening.

 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4276.632s">And</a> I don't know what happened thereafter, but maybe there's something to that that might be of some help for the, across industries for these children. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4291.221s">if</a> they could hire them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4293.443s">Thank</a> you for listening.<h2><a href="../2025-03-18_Sqp6S0Yyr0A/2025-03-18_Sqp6S0Yyr0A.html">Medford, MA City Council - Sep. 27, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10851.051s">Greetings,</a> Councilor, President, Andrew Castagnetti, Cushing Street, Method Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10856.912s">Smart</a> new growth is a wonderful thing, most of the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10861.593s">When</a> I was a kid, before Marada did any of his huge projects, I reiterate, living on Mystic Avenue, of all places, <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10870.426s">commercial</a> the old highway to Boston before they built Route 93 in 1960, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10878.113s">I</a> said many times I would have taken all of Mystic Ave on one side only, by eminent domain, when we had the muscle and it was affordable, even if there was an EPA problem at the junkyard. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10893.167s">And</a> I would have put a ring road next to 93. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10896.295s">and</a> keep them off Main Street, unless they really want to go to deeper squalor in those days, and build 20 stories high.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10907.081s">If</a> you worked here, you'd be at work now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10910.242s">Mr.</a> Sloan took my idea 10 years ago on his billboard, 1.5 in the community to the left, on the major highway, of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10920.147s">However,</a> that's near the end of the act, because no one would listen to me then, and I'm not even sure about today. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10926.897s">But</a> that would have taken a lot of the property tax heat off mama and papa in those days, if it was done properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10937.383s">And</a> it's not being done properly as of today, still. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10940.946s">As</a> we know, Prop 2.5. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10942.206s">Thank</a> Barbara Anderson, rest her soul. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10947.51s">Every</a> year, you can only raise it 200 percent on your so-called tax levy, which is approximately very close to $100 million this past budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10956.907s">So</a> that's 2.5% maximum unless you apply for an override. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10961.708s">So</a> that's 2.5 million on top of the 100 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10965.609s">And</a> they never go to 2.5. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10969.05s">They</a> seem to go to 2.49% right on the money, very efficiently close to the max. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10979.013s">So</a> this smart new growth is wonderful, especially the Roman Empire way. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10985.628s">which</a> is like Assembly Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10987.65s">If</a> you lived, worked, and played here, you wouldn't even need a bicycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10992.254s">That's</a> very smart. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10993.715s">That</a> is smart. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10998.199s">My</a> major point is when you have more children attending schools, it costs money for the schools to fire the police. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11011.771s">And</a> the problem is the new growth is hurting the existing real estate taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11018.652s">It's</a> killing us. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11020.493s">Think</a> about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11021.013s">It's</a> common sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11025.274s">If</a> you use the new growth and applied it to that 2.49% increase on a yearly basis, like clockwork for the past many decades I've been around, fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11037.416s">But</a> you don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11039.117s">The</a> city does not. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11042.255s">They</a> take the $100 million and they tax it 2.5% increase, $2.5 million, and they do not deduct that new growth, which was approximately $1.5 to $2 million last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11056.718s">If</a> they did that first, then the increase wouldn't be $2.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11064.139s">It</a> would be more like $1 million increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11067.019s">Instead</a> of my two-family house going up at a rate of 8%, <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11071.39s">So</a> what about Prop 2 1⁄2? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11072.571s">Well,</a> forget about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11074.132s">It's</a> hard to explain it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11075.874s">That's</a> a fallacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11078.316s">So</a> my 2 feet under goes up $400 a year in the past 2 years consecutively. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11083.921s">And</a> before that, who knows? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11088.304s">But</a> they don't apply the new growth to the Prop 2 1⁄2 increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11094.43s">Now</a> that's a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11096.431s">I</a> rest my case.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13016.03s">Yes,</a> if I may, I didn't want to interrupt your moment of silence from my old neighbor, Jack McGlynn, Sr. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13023.012s">I'd</a> be amiss not to say, read this short three paragraphs, <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13028.249s">Please.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13028.549s">If</a> I may, please, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13032.35s">I'd</a> like to say some kind words about my old neighbor, Mr. John Jake, Jack Sr. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13038.672s">McGlynn.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13039.612s">But</a> first off, if I may, I'd like to commend you, Councilor President Dello Russo, for doing an outstanding job on Jack's stately funeral. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13050.115s">Mr.</a> McGlynn Sr. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13051.735s">may</a> have been the consummate politician <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13054.48s">But</a> more importantly, he was and still is, as he is reunited with his wonderful wife, Helen Lennox, the consummate gentleman, a kind and gentle man all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13067.929s">May</a> God bless him and all of us to emulate his character while we are still here on Earth. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13075.954s">Also,</a> I'd like to share a little known fact about Jack Sr. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13082.922s">In</a> 1980, I knocked on his door to introduce myself as his new neighbor, and he surprised me by speaking in a fluent Southern Italian dialect. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13095.091s">This</a> blew my mind, but later on I surmised he must have learned it as a child, as I did, my Northern Italian dialect. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13104.497s">Maybe</a> he learned it from the Perica or the Catino, but I believe it's the Perica side of the family. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13112.688s">Although</a> I know he also spoke Latin. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13116.791s">There's</a> lots more good stories from the past 36 years, but I'll keep it very brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13123.556s">Okay,</a> I'll just say one more. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13126.278s">About</a> 20 years ago, my son knocked on his door for Halloween. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13130.521s">Jack</a> come running down the stairs from the second floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13135.605s">Put</a> some candy in his bag, I guess, and then when he came back down, my son, <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13140.937s">He</a> says, Andrew, is that your boy? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13142.717s">I</a> said, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13144.758s">He</a> says, send him back. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13145.898s">So</a> anyways, he started to deposit some more treats in his bag. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13149.619s">It's</a> like US currency. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13154.82s">Sweet</a> guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13155.98s">Furthermore,</a> can you imagine how many wakes the man attended to? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13164.262s">Including</a> both my parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13166.463s">Didn't</a> have to do these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13169.045s">The</a> man was and will always be a class act. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13173.128s">He</a> truly is one of the greats of the greatest generation. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13176.991s">Jack</a> will be sorely missed, but not forgotten. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13180.153s">Thank</a> you for listening.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_81H3OXzw2Ec/2025-03-21_81H3OXzw2Ec.html">Medford, MA City Council - July 19, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=9539.758s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=9540.298s">Councilor,</a> president Andrew Kasten, Eddie Cushion street method mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=9546.982s">Um,</a> first off everything body and pet deserves to have us place. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=9555.666s">I</a> definitely agree with it and away. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=9559.028s">First</a> off, I do like some dogs and at times even more than some of the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=9566.809s">But</a> dogs, if they're unleashed in a public area, they must be in a fenced-in area, or else we may for sure have an extra safety problem in 02155. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=9579.357s">If</a> it's approved, therefore, would the city, although they say maybe no, be responsible for any dog attacks in the future? <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=9594.905s">for</a> dogs behaving badly? <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=9599.026s">What</a> about the so-called $1.5 million, whatever the figure was, dog park? <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=9606.988s">Therefore,</a> maybe we don't need the dog park. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=9611.009s">So</a> can we cancel that dog park and give our money back to the taxpayers or grant money? <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=9619.711s">Also,</a> who decides if a dog is well-behaved? <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=9624.77s">And</a> if it is true, according to GOP, is it not possible for any dog to have a bout of rage? <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=9634.116s">Therefore,</a> if you, the political leaders, allow this, you may have, maybe you should have dog owners post a bond in the city also to cover all possible dog attacks and injuries. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=9653.91s">In</a> closing, maybe my godfather was right. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=9657.311s">After</a> all, in this country, they care more about the dogs than they do the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=9665.314s">Also,</a> my friend's daughter, as a girl, was brutally mauled in her face and attacked by a dog and required multiple surgeries and, I'm sure, trauma to this day. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=9681.48s">Very</a> sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=9683.52s">P.S.,</a> the average lawsuit, I believe I told the mayor at a meeting over a month ago about this, is about $40,000 per dog attack in the United States of America. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=9697.368s">Personally</a> speaking, I would not repeal your city's leash law. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=9703.251s">Rather,</a> I would reason on the side of caution and safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=9707.373s">The</a> dog is in your court. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=9708.834s">Thank</a> you for your attention.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_L9vF4yM-fUc/2025-03-21_L9vF4yM-fUc.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 28, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8064.749s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8066.73s">Actually,</a> no, it's not on the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8069.991s">However,</a> it's partially on the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8072.891s">I</a> want to say, and this may shock you, <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8079.928s">However,</a> I've been to a lot of these budget meetings that all you Councilors have been to in the last few months, it seems like. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8090.655s">And</a> I never realized how much work that you, lady and gentlemen, put in. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8098.6s">It's</a> astounding. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8101.062s">So</a> if I may, I'd like to commend you on all the hard work, and it's incredible. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8107.688s">I</a> really, I've never realized it was that intensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8113.333s">I</a> don't have the budget myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8117.356s">I'm</a> not privy or I just don't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8120.879s">So</a> therefore, I didn't read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8122.901s">Matter</a> of fact, if I had it, I probably would have a hard time reading it because I have learning disabilities and a head injury, not to sound like Dr. Woods. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8134.991s">However,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8136.656s">I</a> probably have a better chance of reading the Bible instead. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8141.359s">But</a> if it was in my power, I would automatically give all you Councilors a 50% pay increase on a yearly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8152.667s">I</a> honestly would. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8154.368s">Even</a> though you might be, you might be, are you interested? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8158.591s">You</a> may be the second highest paid study Councilors in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts after <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8163.55s">or</a> the third, or the fourth. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8166.531s">Out</a> of 351 communities, I'm sure you're in the top 5%, which would be the top 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8171.874s">But</a> actually, I would actually double your salaries if you would, this December, when you set the tax rate, as Brianna looks and smiles, give me what they have in Somerville, Everett, and Malden, the owner occupied 20% real estate tax savings. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8193.609s">for</a> the owner occupied. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8194.869s">If</a> you live in one house only, and the city will still get their levy of $104 million, they would not lose a dollar of tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8205.532s">It</a> would just be shifted to all others, multiple real estate owners, whether they're Lemire apartment buildings, Meadow Glen malls, Wegmans, or whatever that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8217.855s">They</a> would not lose a dime, but yet, <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8221.344s">Somerville,</a> Everett, and Malden does this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8224.065s">And</a> I won't even mention that Somerville gets 35% with a special exclusion permission, I should say, from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8233.328s">So</a> I hope this December I would like to double your salary if we could just get the owner-occupied real estate tax exemption at the 20% under the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Chapter 56. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8248.996s">Law</a> Section 5C. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8252.118s">I'll</a> see you in December. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8255.041s">However,</a> if you're going to go on hiatus in the next few months, I wish you all a happy, safe summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8261.525s">Thank</a> you for listening.

 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4474.39s">Yes,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4475.37s">Andrew</a> Castagnetti, Method, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4479.811s">I</a> was only going to bring up one point when Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4481.792s">Jean</a> had spoken. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4483.62s">It's</a> been a lengthy conversation and I come up with some more points. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4487.503s">I'm</a> sure I'm not going to take up 10 minutes, whoever knowing me. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4491.666s">So</a> anyways, first off, I'm not for or against this development. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4498.571s">I</a> don't know enough about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4501.673s">490</a> units of apartments for residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4505.256s">I</a> believe that's the number that's they have applied for. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4509.099s">It</a> seems like a big number to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4512.952s">Can</a> someone give me an idea like a block away from this location behind the old metal glam mall? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4520.536s">Well,</a> where miss is gonna go. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4521.696s">I</a> think Marauder. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4522.777s">Mr.</a> Marauder built some condominium complex kind of a large built I'd say does anyone can answer my question like how many units that is to give a comparison perspective a little bit someone please ballpark anyone 140
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4549.017s">Do</a> you know who Mr. Marauders is?
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4562.221s">Approximately,</a> if it's a twin size, that's about 100 units, 120. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4567.522s">So</a> this is like three, four, five times, who knows, if we're accurate, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4574.101s">That's</a> huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4575.582s">However,</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4580.204s">Jean</a> brought up a good point, and I believe ex-councilor Pinter, who spoke a little while ago, alluded to this same comment that Jean had made at past council meetings, when he said we should, I believe his words were, something to the effect that we should have bought <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4603.602s">that</a> corner piece of real estate on Riverside Avenue, Locust Street, where the trucks have trouble making that turn. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4612.584s">When</a> we had the muscle, it was more affordable, and maybe we had some free cash back then also. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4619.866s">And</a> I believe the building is up for sale now, or it was recently sold, and maybe that's part of a development cost for a developer. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4634.104s">Now,</a> I read in the local newspaper, method transcript, that someone was quoted, I believe, saying that this building was going to be mixed use. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4645.132s">Mixed</a> use is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4647.094s">That's</a> how the Roman Empire took care of business in Europe. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4650.256s">When</a> they would conquer a city, like whatever it was, they'll call it Paris. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4654.479s">You</a> don't have to fight. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4656.0s">We</a> will be your army. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4658.342s">We</a> build a round wall, plenty of land. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4661.577s">Now</a> we're going to put the Coliseum in the center. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4663.358s">That's</a> your entertainment. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4664.239s">No</a> more blood and war. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4667.7s">We</a> built City Hall, the Forum, the churches. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4673.524s">Anyways,</a> what they did was once they filled up that community in a round circle, they farmed the land outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4680.627s">But</a> then they would not develop from Boston to Somerville to South Medford to North Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4687.311s">They</a> would say, let's go 50 miles away. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4689.312s">We'll</a> call it Worcester instead. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4691.085s">and</a> start a new development. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4692.886s">And</a> that was perfect mixed-use from 2,000 years ago or more. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4699.188s">So</a> mixed-use is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4701.429s">I</a> remember from the North End, they had businesses downstairs, upstairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4706.471s">They</a> would sleep in their apartments. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4709.152s">Don't</a> need a car or a bicycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4711.313s">It</a> makes great sense, mixed-use. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4713.533s">However,</a> if you're talking 500 units and <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4718.588s">The</a> average apartment is supposed to be 1,000 square feet, I believe, from my real estate days, I recollect. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4725.673s">So</a> that's a half a million square feet of residential space. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4730.556s">So</a> they're talking 7,000 square feet on the ground floor for the mixed use end, not even a coffee shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4739.442s">That's</a> not even 1%. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4745.18s">I</a> mean, 10% of half a million is $50,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4747.042s">They're</a> talking $7,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4749.604s">Mr.</a> President, I'm over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4755.929s">So,</a> this doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4765.517s">Now,</a> my major concern as being a person that's trying to get owner-occupied real estate tax exemption for Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4774.208s">because</a> some of our Everett and Malden does it, but we don't do it for the owner occupies in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4780.21s">So</a> I'd be concerned if this was a sweetheart deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4782.711s">First</a> of all, I'd like to know what the residential real estate tax value is going to be before it's built. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4793.954s">I</a> also want to know, I request to know what the tax rate is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4804.25s">for,</a> and what it is called, if it's called residential, or condominiums, if they go condominium down the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4813.617s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4817.36s">Councilor</a> Falco has been trying for zoning, or looking at new zoning, and I think it makes good sense for the new development that's coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4831.712s">As</a> a matter of fact, in 1960, <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4833.884s">As</a> a child, I was living on Mystic Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4841.628s">And</a> one of my ideas was the city should have taken all of Mystic Avenue only on the Route 93 side. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4854.755s">And</a> they could build a ring road <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4860.476s">to</a> keep the people that would be living in the new buildings off Main Street, unless they really wanted to go to deeper squalor in those days. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4871.885s">And</a> I would have built all high rise office buildings, even 20 stories high. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4879.551s">And</a> if you worked there, you'd be at work now, as Marshall Sloan took the idea and put it on his billboard five years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4891.34s">and</a> helped to lower the real estate tax on Mar and Pa back in the 60s, mind you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4898.184s">Now</a> it's 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4900.785s">Now</a> the people realize we're not a bedroom community. <a

 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10953.293s">Andrew</a> Castagnetti, Method, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10959.175s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10959.615s">Don't</a> get mad at me, but you're the prettiest VP, Vice President I've seen today. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10964.716s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10965.957s">So</a> anyways, I want to thank Mrs. Alicia Hunt for performing her job and trying or implying to save us the residential <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10984.47s">electric</a> payers some money on their bills, hopefully, if it ever goes through there. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10992.715s">However,</a> I know what I pay for my supply service side of the electric bill from National Grid on Cushing Street, and that rate is X amount of cents per kilowatt hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11014.383s">Coincidentally,</a> direct energy, I'm sorry, you didn't get that? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11022.049s">I'm</a> paying X amounts cents per kilowatt hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11027.012s">I</a> left it blank on purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11029.094s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11029.914s">Thank</a> you for paying attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11033.357s">So</a> coincidentally, direct energy knocked on my door and I actually gave them half hour of my time this time instead of zero time. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11045.082s">And</a> they gave me a contract just to use and read, but he didn't want me to keep it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11050.706s">But</a> this is it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11053.888s">He</a> came back later, and I compared it to what he offered. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11057.591s">He</a> offered X amount of cents less than what I'm paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11062.155s">And</a> much to my chagrin, he told me a lot of my neighbors are paying less than I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11068.279s">And</a> I did not know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11071.081s">So</a> I presume some people are paying <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11074.583s">even</a> more than I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11076.024s">That</a> sort of tells me that there is no set rate, I guess, period. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11082.446s">It</a> could vary. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11084.186s">I'm</a> not sure how much it could fluctuate. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11087.707s">So</a> through the chair, I never did hear what the cost would be, presently speaking, or through Alicia's energy connections in her department. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11102.677s">What</a> is the latest rate that you heard of per kilowatt hours on the supply side? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11109.181s">No</a> one would I pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11110.642s">And</a> people out there that may be in the audience listening, that they may go home and check their bill, see what they're paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11117.807s">Can</a> you please answer me for the chair?
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11121.649s">What</a> is the kilowatt hour rate, the latest that you know of?
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11126.412s">Do</a> you understand the question? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11130.355s">Do</a> you understand the question?
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11211.396s">Thank</a> you very much, Mrs. Hunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11217.378s">Okay,</a> direct energy offered me 0.09 cents, which is, as they would say, two-tenths of a cent less than what the latest one in Melrose was. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11231.964s">So</a> direct energy, I believe, is two-tenths of a cent cheaper per kilowatt hour on the supply service charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11242.876s">If</a> I took this offer from direct energy, if it's still available today, from May 30th, I'd be saving 16%, and that would always be 16%. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11252.883s">For</a> one full year thereafter, there is no guarantee in life. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11257.727s">That's</a> what the market rate would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11259.548s">If</a> someone brought up solar energy, if I may go off course, but stay on the grid of solar energy, this is from a method transcript <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11271.868s">I</a> believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11275.289s">And</a> there's a picture of Senator Patricia G. Holland. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11281.271s">Jalen,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11284.812s">She</a> was among one of those who voted to pass the solar energy bill signed into law by the governor on April 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11291.454s">This</a> is in the transcript on April 28, 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11300.762s">And</a> in a nutshell, it says, legislature passes solar energy bill, lifting the net metering cap. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11310.188s">So</a> the first paragraph I'll only read, the Massachusetts legislator recently passed legislation that raises the solar net metering cap. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11318.793s">Net</a> metering allows consumers, businesses, and municipalities to produce solar power and feed it back into the electric grid <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11329.622s">for</a> discounts on electric expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11332.344s">The</a> legislator raises the net metering cap 3 percent for private facilities and 3 percent for public facilities, which will allow solar projects currently in the development pipeline to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11349.213s">I</a> guess it is an incentive of sorts to get these projects more off the oil addiction, as Mr. Bush would say. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11359.585s">My</a> point or question is, if the state really cared about us, they wouldn't have any cap whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11368.852s">And</a> we could sell it all back to the electric company and tell them to get a real job instead. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11374.315s">Thank</a> you for listening.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_B3oaa8YVtBA/2025-03-21_B3oaa8YVtBA.html">Medford, MA City Council - May 31, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6986.647s">And</a> at the Committee of the Whole meeting with the Mayor, you had mentioned, I believe, it costs $25 per panel. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6995.814s">for</a> the concrete aggregated self material and $28 labor, which equals approximately, you believe, $53 average per panel, depending on how the contract comes in. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7014.866s">A</a> panel, I presume, is four feet by six feet, if that, not even. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7022.231s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7024.815s">So</a> my final question to you would be, hopefully my final question is, on average, if you could just ballpark 600 locations on average per location, some might be yay big, some might be a lot bigger. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7043.084s">Can</a> you give me an average per location what the cost might be, please?

I'm just not that smart. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9530.43s">However,</a> after 28 years of having the same old charter of plan A government, maybe it's time to simply <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9540.305s">review</a> our charter options. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9544.147s">It's</a> sort of like a business corporation reviewing its business plan to better compete and be more successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9554.592s">Even</a> at our next election on November 8, 2016, the voters could, would, hopefully, simply elect a nine-person commission who can only <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9569.667s">make</a> recommendations and nothing else. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9574.03s">And</a> then those recommendations, if any, would go on the following year's 2017 voting ballot, allowing all voters to decide yes or no to any proposed changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9591.24s">With</a> that, that I said. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9594.668s">I</a> understand that some citizens want this process to go forward in the traditional way versus going the way of a home rule petition through the Massachusetts State House. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9608.958s">But</a> it is a monumental task and highly improbable to collect the required 5,300 signatures to put this question on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9623.276s">We</a> don't have that Miss Frazzuli type of gun hoe, go get them, back in the 80s. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9630.9s">However,</a> please note this charter review petition presently has about 1,500 signatures or more. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9642.767s">By</a> the way, I almost forgot to say the CPA ballot, which passed, only needed and had approximately <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9653.34s">1750</a> signatures. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9656.742s">How</a> did that happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9661.624s">Need</a> I say more? <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9662.804s">If</a> I wanted to repeat my song that I have done for five years every December and get a petition to get the owner occupied for real estate tax exemption on the ballot, <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9678.84s">I'm</a> not sure the state would let me do that with 1,750 signatures. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9686.163s">I</a> think I need 20% of the registered voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9689.344s">I</a> think that would be 5,300 or more. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9692.745s">And</a> they have to be certified, verified, and all that jazz. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9702.608s">I</a> didn't write the second page. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9705.089s">I'm</a> just basically confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9707.53s">I'm</a> dismayed. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9709.012s">about</a> Methods Home Rule petition by Massachusetts legislation, bill number 4227. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9717.895s">What</a> they did or what they did not do. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9722.776s">I'm</a> told this was a reverse Houdini. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9729.559s">I</a> don't know what that means, but someone very intelligent told me that, and I have no idea, so maybe it's, <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9737.351s">I</a> should change the title and call it Houdini Effect and use Andrew's words. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9745.713s">Now</a> you see it and now you don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9749.834s">I'm</a> very confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9754.375s">I</a> don't know nothing.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_WjkcDsmFdD4/2025-03-21_WjkcDsmFdD4.html">Medford, MA City Council - May 10, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

<a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=264.471s">I'm</a> asking all city council and mayor candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=267.573s">to</a> respond to this question before the upcoming election so that the voters have ample time to read your responses and cast their ballots for candidates who support tax relief for the citizens of our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=282.325s">Please</a> send your written response to the method transcript, letters to the editor, and so we the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=288.811s">Thank</a> you for your attention and response. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=290.592s">APC.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=294.255s">My</a> question was not asked at the great debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=298.159s">And</a> as of tonight, December 8th, 2015, I have not seen any replies of communication in the method transcript as requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=307.823s">Maybe</a> you are not aware of this, come with the Massachusetts law or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=317.387s">I</a> took some time today and I prepared a sampling of all the city appraised valuations. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=328.201s">some</a> of them, most of the city Councilors, homes in the mirrors, and all of these city appraised valuations are below 539,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=338.391s">Even</a> if all of these home values increase 10% next year, they will still see their real estate tax bill go down up to $600 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=356.494s">instead</a> of the usual $130 to $390 increase every year, after year, after year, and so on. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=367.34s">The</a> one exception is one of the Councilors, and it may go up a whopping $7. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=375.784s">Bottom</a> line, nine of 10 owner-occupied average homeowners will save <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=385.924s">about</a> $200 a year instead of the usual $200 increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=390.725s">That's</a> a big swing. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=392.606s">Again,</a> why not here? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=397.167s">And</a> I'm under the weather. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=399.428s">I'm</a> not feeling so good, so I never finished the rest of my spiel. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=404.13s">But</a> basically, I hope when you do the allocation that you will <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=414.254s">give</a> the average owner, occupied homeowner who lives in their one house only the full 20 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=422.759s">That's</a> all I have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=424.54s">I</a> request for the sixth consecutive year. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=427.761s">Thank</a> you for listening.
 <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3106.04s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3108.182s">I'm</a> not sure which question you're moving, so I had a few notations and I didn't want to interrupt prior, so I'd like to just blurt them out if I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3116.648s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3121.895s">The</a> Mass General Law 56-5C is flawed on a Massachusetts state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3129.162s">But</a> don't forget, at least the state did something right to try to help the middle class. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3134.988s">Let's</a> not lose that perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3138.531s">So</a> why are we not adopting it? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3142.335s">Boston's</a> at 37.5%. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3146.313s">My</a> information here is inaccurate at 30%. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3148.433s">Some</a> of those inaccurate in my packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3151.134s">It's</a> not 30, it's 35%. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3153.694s">I'm</a> just shooting for the 20 maximum by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3156.775s">Not</a> only does this city, this body, city council have to approve it by a majority vote, also the mayor, whatever mayor has to also approve it or else the state won't automatically give it to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3174.42s">So</a> that's why my amendment, or my whatever you want to call it, petition, never petitioned in my life, asked for both to adopt it, or else it just gets filed in the basket. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3193.023s">Meanwhile,</a> I would like to fix the state law, however, <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3203.736s">That</a> will be my final mission as far as city hall business. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3207.398s">After</a> the second mission, which I'm not divulging right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3210.7s">And</a> the first mission, this is at hand right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3213.642s">Let's</a> get this one done today for the middle class while they still exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3220.867s">By</a> the way, the law is flawed. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3223.949s">And</a> I believe somebody applied for a home rule petitioner from what I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3227.911s">I</a> never saw the document. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3229.292s">I</a> asked for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3230.513s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3232.677s">And</a> there should be a flat, I believe, if you can make the mathematics work, according to the formulas. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3239.181s">Maybe</a> a flat, whatever it is, 10% off your real tax dollars, period, for every single owner occupied, if you live in one house. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3248.987s">And</a> to clarify something from Mr. Marks, if you live in one family, two, three, four, condo, or a hundred unit building, you will get <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3259.717s">under</a> this master law, blah, blah, blah, blah. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3262.519s">The</a> owner occupied exclusion providing the city council majority at the opposite and the mirror or mirrors at least one at the right time. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3277.25s">So</a> having said all that, the more the law is flawed, but as we speak, like 12,000, <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3288.465s">The</a> number is staggering. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3290.225s">Who</a> gets this? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3291.866s">Let's</a> not lose fact of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3294.667s">12,000</a> is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3296.987s">Let's</a> see. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3301.048s">16,000</a> plus owner occupied. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3304.429s">That</a> includes real estate, land also. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3306.97s">So</a> let's deal with the projected Ed O'Neill number that he believes estimate of 12,000 and change are owner occupied. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3317.848s">Yeah,</a> 1,569 will go up because the law is flawed, granted. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3324.252s">But</a> don't forget, you're talking about 10,695 that will see a decrease versus the usual 100-year standard increases per annum. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3333.778s">It's</a> huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3338.361s">So</a> back to Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3342.744s">So</a> you get the way the formula works, the way I understand <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3347.618s">high</a> school education, 68, 11 went to forestry. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3351.7s">The</a> thing is, it's 20% of a shift, I believe Ed told me, and what I read in the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3359.564s">So</a> the shift of, let's say, about $96 million it was last year, went up like 3.5%, so much for Prop 2.5, that's a fallacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3369.269s">And</a> this year it's going over $100 million, that's over 4.5% increase right now that they're talking, mind you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3378.088s">But</a> the point is, it's a shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3379.548s">And</a> they're divided into, I guess, the 12,000 possible owner-occupieds. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3385.13s">And</a> that comes out to a grand total, at the full 20% I'm asking for, of about $87,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3390.311s">Is</a> that correct, Mr. Ed? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3395.693s">It</a> is. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3396.113s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3399.314s">Thanks,</a> John. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3400.394s">$87,000</a> value reduction from your appraised value. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3403.435s">So</a> therefore, if you have a Marauder 100-unit building and you do live there, <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3411.024s">you</a> can only deduct the 87,000 Councilor Marks, not the 99 units that you don't live in. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3418.488s">It's</a> only pertaining to your unit, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3421.989s">Furthermore,</a> so therefore eight out of nine, or maybe 11 out of 12, the numbers are kind of blurred. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3436.999s">But</a> it's like 90% of owner-occupies are going to save versus the usual increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3444.023s">Last</a> year, I think I put a dollar coin here, and I put nine coins here. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3449.586s">After</a> five, I get tired of counting. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3451.227s">I</a> just drop the whole package. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3453.248s">10</a> to 1 save. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3457.05s">I</a> don't know how to say it diplomatically. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3462.753s">Clarify</a> to Mr. Marks, $87,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3467.445s">And</a> by the way, new growth, what is this? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3471.127s">What's</a> the word, panacea, panacea? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3473.848s">The</a> new growth, or is it a fallacy? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3476.069s">It's</a> supposed to help our parents pay their real estate taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3480.651s">Now</a> the parents are gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3481.632s">We</a> become the elders, as they say. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3484.013s">So</a> what happened to all this new growth that's supposed to help? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3486.614s">Station</a> Lenin, for one example, Lemire and Nishmir, and then you have <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3495.578s">to</a> River Edge or something to that effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3497.678s">We</a> destroyed a bunch of buildings, lost a lot of commercial tax revenue when that was done. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3502.119s">And</a> then we had an economic crash, no fault of my own or your own probably. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3507.22s">And</a> we didn't recoup at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3509.301s">Now,</a> I hope we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3510.861s">But</a> the new growth is not helping the average taxpayer for real estate. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3516.722s">I</a> don't see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3518.263s">Maybe</a> I should have went to college more than high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3521.223s">I</a> don't see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3522.524s">And</a> then I'm told, well, that has to get done. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3525.197s">in</a> June, July, whenever the budget is presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3528.978s">Well,</a> then what came first? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3530.739s">I</a> don't mind the chicken and egg, the cat or the horse. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3533.62s">Isn't</a> that the time to have this new growth, take some of the edge off the middle class so they can still exist, maybe. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3546.605s">So</a> therefore, I keep on ranting about requesting my full 20%. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3554.756s">Because</a> also, according to Ed O'Neill in his documents, I should say, the cutoff, I call it the push, is $580,000 at 10%, 15%, or 20%. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3567.098s">So</a> it's not going to go any higher that you pay more, so why not go for the full 20? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3575.52s">I</a> won't even get into going for special legislation or exemption to go for the Somerville telephone numbers in Boston even higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3585.452s">If</a> you can't do the 20, meet me halfway and give us the 10 cents on the total. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3591.013s">By</a> the way, the circuit breaker he mentioned, Mr. O'Neill, that's on a state level, real estate income tax, I should say. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3598.495s">I</a> think the formula, what they used to do for my mom when she was alive, I believe it's like you take 10% of your adjusted gross income and you take half your water bill, I believe, and your real estate, total it up, <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3614.975s">And</a> every dollar above whatever the formula is, you get back dollar for dollar, up to a max at that time was $900, and today it's over $1,000 easily. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3625.497s">And</a> you don't have to pay any Massachusetts income tax to get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3630.798s">A</a> lot of accountants I speak to, even CPAs, don't know what I'm talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3634.879s">But</a> it's a fact that it exists, and a lot of people might get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3638.84s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3639.18s">Good</a> night.

Anyways, I'm not sure how to feel about this before your decision for the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4863.598s">However,</a> it seems like these water bills, the new tiered system that went into effect a few years back, and I'm not sure if the state set those numbers with the tiered <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4876.163s">But</a> it seems like it adds insult to injury to the ratepayer for water in the MWRA system, because Tier 1 is for, I believe, single-family usage, and it's X amount, like let's just say 12 cents per gallon or whatever it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4895.937s">However,</a> Tier 2 allows more, and that's at a little bit higher cost, a cent more. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4906.375s">Tier</a> 3, that was not really the third because they called it un-tiered for the next highest price, which is fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4919.461s">However,</a> Tier 3 is higher than the un-tiered. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4925.844s">Well,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4926.457s">That</a> means a three-family, in effect, is paying more per gallon than all others outside of a one, two, or three-family home. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4938.001s">And</a> that is businesses, commercial, industrial, maybe, otherwise it has something to do with lobbying the state house to pass this law and its tiered structure, whether it was the state's doing or the local doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4954.155s">It</a> seems like it's as insult to further rape as injuries. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4958.278s">Thank</a> you.
