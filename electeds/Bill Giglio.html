 <p>[Bill Giglio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=5425.201s">Hello,</a> can you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=5426.021s">I'm</a> sorry, did you unmute me? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=5427.58s">I</a> apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=5428.641s">All</a> right, so I have just a couple of quick questions for Councilor Tseng, Councilor Calling. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=5433.663s">So</a> if you're saying, you know, in Medford, you want them to be, you know, you don't want deportation, how many have actually been deported that live here in Medford and not being deported for a criminal reason? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=5445.71s">Do</a> we have that number?
 <p>[Bill Giglio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=5460.643s">They</a> don't have to, but can they?
 <p>[Bill Giglio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=5466.266s">I</a> understand.
 <p>[Bill Giglio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=5468.968s">Okay,</a> that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=5471.349s">And</a> then one of the paragraphs I'm reading, it says, whereas in early September, 2021, that they're being sent <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=5477.463s">anyone</a> crossing over the borders is being held and then sent back. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=5480.445s">But</a> I believe wasn't that policy put in because we, that was in the midst of a major pandemic, which I, you know, I've heard for the, like literally the last two years from everybody on this council, we can't even do major things in Medford, but if people are pouring into the country without being tested or we don't know, and they're literally being put on planes and dropped off into, uh, states like New York and here in Massachusetts, is that not concerning to anybody?
 <p>[Bill Giglio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=5514.098s">Why?</a> 
 <p>[Bill Giglio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=5519.139s">Yeah,</a> why does he want to end this?

 <p>[Bill Giglio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1432.151s">You</a> can hear me fine? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1434.071s">Okay,</a> my name's Bill Giglio. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1435.752s">My</a> statement is for Paul, and this is not to pick on Paul or anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1439.954s">Paul,</a> you're in your second term, but yet this has never been an issue with you in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1445.917s">Your</a> platform or anyone else on the committee's platform has never ran <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1450.296s">on</a> the name change being such a high priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1453.419s">Since</a> becoming a member just before the 2019 election of an extreme left progressive group called the Our Revolution, this seems to fall right in line with their ideology of changing history and the national narrative of cancel culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1465.909s">So</a> your resolution to change the name of the Columbus School seems a little sketchy, suspicious, and disingenuous. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1471.393s">Plus</a> we all know this opens up the floodgates for everything else to be renamed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1476.537s">That's</a> just my first half. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1477.338s">But</a> my second half is actually a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1479.019s">This</a> was obviously a go. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1480.952s">So</a> like the other gentleman had said, what is going to be the cost for this? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1485.253s">When</a> can we expect the breakdown of who's going to be doing such work, such as the lawyers, contractors, state filing fees, and what they're going to be getting paid to do their work? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1495.796s">If</a> this is being funded by some sort of donations, when can we expect a list of who's donating? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1500.737s">And</a> should a group such as the Our Revolution be allowed to donate? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1506.979s">Because</a> I can tell you, a lot of us do not want this coming out of <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1511.181s">school</a> money or tax funded money.
 <p>[Bill Giglio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1520.509s">I'll</a> ask at this point, why if, if the, if the date would have been July, how come there's none of that is even thought of or, or, you know, research. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1534.68s">I</a> mean, that's, that's a, that's a huge factor.
 <p>[Bill Giglio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1727.731s">So</a> if you're saying you don't have, if you're saying that there was plenty, there was ample time and there's still ample time, then why is Kathy Creeds then asking for more time?
