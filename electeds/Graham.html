    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2077.892s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2078.352s">[Graham]</a>: I'm really excited to see this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2080.933s">[Graham]</a>: I know we've talked about this a couple times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2083.434s">[Graham]</a>: A couple of questions I had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2085.495s">[Graham]</a>: If somebody would like to participate on the curriculum review team, who do they reach out to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2093.599s">[Graham]</a>: And how will the community that may not be watching the school committee meeting know to engage in this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2110.574s">[Graham]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2111.634s">[Graham]</a>: And does the HECAT require that the sexual health evaluation be evidence-based?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2166.992s">[Graham]</a>: And the other question I had looking at the timeline, just thinking about the potential budget implications, if you all aren't formulating your responses or your recommendations,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2180.161s">[Graham]</a>: until the June timeframe, it sounds like there just may be a mismatch in terms of what we may or may not need from a budget standpoint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2191.09s">[Graham]</a>: And I didn't know if you took that into consideration when you put the timeline together or if you could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2197.735s">[Graham]</a>: And a couple of the things that I think about really specifically are from an implementation perspective, the middle school students who don't get health because they go to band.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2209.605s">[Graham]</a>: you know, the need for health teach credentialed health teachers that we may or may not have in the district at all levels and how that fits into our staffing and our scheduling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2220.756s">[Graham]</a>: And I just feel like there could be like a whole slew of implications from a budget perspective that we would want to be able to prioritize as quickly as possible, because I think this is long overdue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2232.577s">[Graham]</a>: if we never show those crazy videos to the fifth graders, again, from Proctor and Gamble, it will be too soon for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2238.958s">[Graham]</a>: So I just wanna make sure that there's nothing at the end of this process that sort of delays our ability to implement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2245.76s">[Graham]</a>: Because I do think, at least for me, this is a huge priority for the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2249.281s">[Graham]</a>: And it is, as you mentioned, like the last man standing around curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2254.702s">[Graham]</a>: And I think we may not be willing to wait for the legislature, for DESE,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2261.633s">[Graham]</a>: for the legislature to step in and say, this has to be a priority for districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2265.897s">[Graham]</a>: So I think our kids need this information and this education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2270.581s">[Graham]</a>: And I wanna make sure that whatever we can do to clear the path, that we're doing it proactively for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4045.272s">[Graham]</a>: Can you tell us that I'm looking at the charter numbers for enrollment this year so 3.95 is our charter school enrollment and I think that amounts to 7 or 8 million dollars of tuition going out to those charter schools has that compared to your past the 3.95 do you know sorry could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4066.43s">[Graham]</a>: How does the 395 compare to years past?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6301.428s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6301.888s">[Graham]</a>: We're going to give you a little break here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6304.87s">[Graham]</a>: I'd like to make a motion to suspend the rules and take items eight and 10 out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7141.321s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7143.202s">[Graham]</a>: First, I want to say thank you to Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7145.123s">[Graham]</a>: Branley for coming tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7148.652s">[Graham]</a>: It's really hard to speak in front of a large room of people like this, and it's especially hard to deliver the remarks you just gave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7156.397s">[Graham]</a>: I am really terribly sorry that your family is going through this, and I hope that as we navigate beyond this, that you will find what you're looking for in terms of change in the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7173.528s">[Graham]</a>: Having said that, regarding this motion, give me a second,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7184.683s">[Graham]</a>: When we introduced this climate and culture assessment, it was unanimously approved last fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7189.945s">[Graham]</a>: And it was at least in part a reaction to an incident last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7193.105s">[Graham]</a>: The intent of the motion was not last year was not to narrowly or exclusively address the incident itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7200.972s">[Graham]</a>: I will say that safety and supervision are foundational in daily activities at any school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7205.256s">[Graham]</a>: It's reasonable to assume that any school has the resources, staff, and structures necessary to perform these basic school functions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7212.382s">[Graham]</a>: And when the system doesn't work at these basic functions, it's reasonable to hold the system and the adults accountable for the kind of failure that we see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7223.971s">[Graham]</a>: Separately, the point of the climate and culture assessment, for me at least,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7228.092s">[Graham]</a>: is to take a broader look at our school environment and identify what keeps us from the kind of school we want for our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7235.235s">[Graham]</a>: I want to hear from an expert in the field about how we create a culture that largely avoids these kinds of issues that we find ourselves in right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7242.558s">[Graham]</a>: I want a system that avoids bullying, avoids contributing to the self-esteem issues we see in some kids, avoids process failures, avoids situations where kids can leave school unnoticed, and avoids the communication and PR situations we too often find ourselves in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7258.174s">[Graham]</a>: I want to hear from an expert about how to create that culture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7261.676s">[Graham]</a>: I expect the recommendations to be quite broad and to address everything from staffing to org structure, to curriculum, to personnel, to policy, and more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7270.82s">[Graham]</a>: We keep circling around real solutions that do more than react to a crisis of some kind in this district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7276.363s">[Graham]</a>: At this point, I think we need to hear from an objective party that doesn't care where you are from, who you know, or why it's always been done that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7284.447s">[Graham]</a>: Our kids and our city in general deserve that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7286.795s">[Graham]</a>: Of course, I would expect discipline to be part of that assessment, but I'll say again that safety and supervision are foundational elements of any school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7294.944s">[Graham]</a>: I don't think the district will ever provide a truly satisfying answer for all the privacy reasons that are wildly unpopular and still truly the law, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7306.697s">[Graham]</a>: I do hope that what we can expect from our superintendent and from this committee is accountability, that we will take action and expect more of this district in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7319.501s">[Graham]</a>: It's long past due that we push past the culture and change the culture of this district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7325.642s">[Graham]</a>: It's been needed since long before my kids were a part of MPS, and one of them goes to high school next year, in fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7331.524s">[Graham]</a>: Our kids deserve the best we have to offer, and we need to explore every option to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7337.107s">[Graham]</a>: In terms of just one other note that I want to provide to Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7341.988s">[Graham]</a>: Franley, the rules and policy subcommittee has on its docket a review of our bullying policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7349.15s">[Graham]</a>: And hopefully that meeting will be scheduled in the next coming weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7352.351s">[Graham]</a>: And when it is, we will be sure to reach out and let you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7355.852s">[Graham]</a>: I think there's a lot that goes on from a policy perspective that then has to be executed by the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7362.294s">[Graham]</a>: And when that comes up, we'll make sure that you're aware so you can participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7366.464s">[Graham]</a>: But I do hope my colleagues will join me in again supporting this motion that asks for a detailed update on why this climate and culture assessment hasn't moved forward and what we are going to do to not be here again in three months or six months or a year, having this same conversation and not having done the things that are at our disposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7385.621s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7479.861s">[Graham]</a>: Yep, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7525.863s">[Graham]</a>: That couldn't be further from the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7527.324s">[Graham]</a>: I've been following up on it since we asked for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7531.127s">[Graham]</a>: And I just think it's important for the entire community to be able to hear that same update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7536.657s">[Graham]</a>: that we committee members often get behind the scenes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7538.959s">[Graham]</a>: So I'm hoping that the administration will have something to report to us tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7543.423s">[Graham]</a>: So it took 11 months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7997.203s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7999.385s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9416.604s">[Graham]</a>: Mayor, Member Graham, I was curious what the testing results in the fall told you and what we need to know about them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9589.235s">[Graham]</a>: And I think the other question I had, which<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9593.949s">[Graham]</a>: I don't even know if such a metric exists within math, but comparing to the national average is just a comparison of the average, but what RIT score is proficient?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9611.685s">[Graham]</a>: What should we be shooting for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9614.668s">[Graham]</a>: Just being the national average doesn't necessarily make<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9620.779s">[Graham]</a>: give me like the warm fuzzies, but I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9622.84s">[Graham]</a>: I think that's the question I'm trying to get to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1474.121s">[Graham]</a>: I just have a quick question or a comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1477.383s">[Graham]</a>: If possible, when these recommendations come before us, if there is anything...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1482.964s">[Graham]</a>: sort of, I guess I'll say unusual about what the grant requirements are that those be listed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1488.847s">[Graham]</a>: And the reason it popped up as I was reading this was I remember hearing during the budget that there are particular stipulations in this grant about how we compensate our staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1500.813s">[Graham]</a>: So I would call that noteworthy just to sort of continue to remind folks about what our requirements are in order to accept and be in compliance with these grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1510.987s">[Graham]</a>: like the letter that is attached talks about an impact report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1514.851s">[Graham]</a>: That's important because we want to make sure we're doing those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1517.353s">[Graham]</a>: But if there are other things that sort of...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1520.74s">[Graham]</a>: outlying or restrict or govern in some way or operations, those things need to be called out in the memo as well so that we are just clear on what those things are before we approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1530.904s">[Graham]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4288.221s">[Graham]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4289.522s">[Graham]</a>: How much was the grant from DESE?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4320.197s">[Graham]</a>: OK, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4321.358s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4322.659s">[Graham]</a>: And we've done this before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4325.74s">[Graham]</a>: And how did we pay for it in the past?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4337.263s">[Graham]</a>: And is it a grant that comes around every year or not necessarily?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4342.304s">[Graham]</a>: We have our fingers crossed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4376.053s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4376.653s">[Graham]</a>: It's just helpful to know as we ultimately think about the budget and what needs to go in the budget, particularly because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4384.522s">[Graham]</a>: planning for this, if we're doing it in advance, is going to pre-date, you know, precede any sort of budget hearings and approvals and all of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4391.744s">[Graham]</a>: So when you're ready to present a proposal, please do so that we can figure out how to handle that proactively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4402.066s">[Graham]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4996.761s">[Graham]</a>: I think the other thing that's important to call out here is the huge disparity in enrollment at our elementary schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5006.685s">[Graham]</a>: In my mind, it was always like about 100 kids different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5010.146s">[Graham]</a>: And now it's like pushing 200 students different between the Roberts and the Missatuck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5017.288s">[Graham]</a>: Almost 150 between Brooks and Missatuck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5021.03s">[Graham]</a>: And I just want to point that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5026.833s">[Graham]</a>: to do a couple of things, but one is to put on our radar collectively that like we can't, the gap can't keep widening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5033.958s">[Graham]</a>: Like we have to do something different than we're doing today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5039.122s">[Graham]</a>: And I've talked to people about this a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5042.225s">[Graham]</a>: There's not an easy, obvious answer short of like picking a bunch of kids up who live at the McGlynn basically and sending them to the Missatuck or picking a bunch of kids up that live next door to the Brooks and sending them to Missatuck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5056.041s">[Graham]</a>: because of the sort of placement of the Missatuck building in the city, there's sort of less that you can draw from to add to those numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5065.33s">[Graham]</a>: And I know it's a huge challenge, but I don't think we can continue to like operate in this fashion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5071.976s">[Graham]</a>: So we have to do something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5759.446s">[Graham]</a>: One of the things that we've been working on through the MSBA process is working with MSBA to certify our enrollment projection for Medford High.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5768.771s">[Graham]</a>: That enrollment projection when we sort of get to agreement is how we will decide how big the school becomes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5776.935s">[Graham]</a>: So we've had to actually do a lot of really like interesting and fascinating work around like future projected enrollment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5784.219s">[Graham]</a>: And so we have to give them information about like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5787.975s">[Graham]</a>: our live births and we have to give them information about projected housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5793.399s">[Graham]</a>: And there's been a whole slew of information we've had to provide to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5797.683s">[Graham]</a>: I am working to make it a little bit more digestible because you have to submit everything into this system and it makes it really hard to extract it in a way that it makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5809.512s">[Graham]</a>: So I am working on something to be able to put on the website so people can see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5813.636s">[Graham]</a>: But it's been sort of an interesting conversation with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5817.604s">[Graham]</a>: folks at city hall about like what is actually coming down the pike from a housing perspective and housing production goals and all of that good stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5827.572s">[Graham]</a>: But I think the other thing that I would say is I would love for the city staff to be watching carefully when real estate in the Roberts neighborhood, like directly adjacent becomes available because there is no way out of the parking situation over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5842.664s">[Graham]</a>: And there's no way out of the playground situation without more space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5847.122s">[Graham]</a>: so i do think the city needs to do something seriously to address that because you can't there are 200 more kids trying to use that playground than trying to use the two playgrounds at missituck and a giant field so there's and there's just literally not time to walk to hickey park for recess every single day so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5869.111s">[Graham]</a>: something has to give there, whether that building becomes drastically smaller in enrollment because of the space constraints, or we try to address the space constraints.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5879.398s">[Graham]</a>: There's probably a bunch of facets there, some of which are in our control and some of which are probably more city controlled sort of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5888.491s">[Graham]</a>: endeavors and decisions so i think we need to look at all of that when we think about distributing what's a reasonable time frame to get that kind of report of what that looks like or what models are being considered the enrollment projection report probably within a month or so i will have that up online for everybody because it is a document that we can share um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5912.921s">[Graham]</a>: So that piece is easy enough to provide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5916.143s">[Graham]</a>: It's just sort of, it's a formatting mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5918.725s">[Graham]</a>: And I think it's going to be really hard for people to digest the way that it sort of gets extracted from the system right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5924.589s">[Graham]</a>: In terms of like that bigger conversation about what happens next, I'll defer to the superintendent, but I would imagine we have to have some meetings where we talk about like what even our goals would be for that kind of conversation, because something like that could start like this big and it could end up this big.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5941.343s">[Graham]</a>: and it could go in any sort of direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5943.164s">[Graham]</a>: So we might want to think about sort of putting some parameters around what we're trying to accomplish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5948.267s">[Graham]</a>: Is that a special meeting of this body?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5951.489s">[Graham]</a>: Is it a strategic planning group?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5954.031s">[Graham]</a>: I think we could maybe do it either way, but I would think it's maybe a committee of the whole because it's such a big project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6965.589s">[Graham]</a>: Member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6966.95s">[Graham]</a>: I would agree with you that this should go on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6969.791s">[Graham]</a>: I'm generally not in favor of charging kids to get to school, like no matter how they have to get there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6978.636s">[Graham]</a>: I don't think we should charge for buses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6980.277s">[Graham]</a>: I think we should provide more buses than we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6982.978s">[Graham]</a>: If you've been paying attention on social media, there's a lot of conversation about buses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6988.922s">[Graham]</a>: The program around free MBTA transportation was stopped without this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6993.854s">[Graham]</a>: committee's authorization to do so, we have to stop charging kids to get them to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6999.358s">[Graham]</a>: Like it's our job to educate them and we can't do that if they're not in school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7002.44s">[Graham]</a>: And so like for me, for any which way that we're gonna charge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7008.032s">[Graham]</a>: families to get them to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7010.094s">[Graham]</a>: It just feels like we're heading in the wrong direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7013.516s">[Graham]</a>: I understand that we are charging some kids and not others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7016.699s">[Graham]</a>: And I think that is also a problem, but charging more kids for me doesn't get us closer to the goal of not charging kids to have to get to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7024.244s">[Graham]</a>: So I'm not super in favor of this, but I do think it should go on the agenda separately noticed so that parents can understand that that's what we are talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8155.634s">[Graham]</a>: I have huge reservations about any idea that we would have to bring buses in-house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8161.829s">[Graham]</a>: I would need to see a bullet proof plan that we're going to do it well, because I think we try to do a lot of things here on the cheap and it never works out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8172.692s">[Graham]</a>: So it would take a lot of convincing for me to agree that we have the organizational capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8180.974s">[Graham]</a>: We lack basic systems and structures every single place that you look.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8186.192s">[Graham]</a>: to think about bringing on something that we know nothing about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8189.273s">[Graham]</a>: I have huge reservations about, I think we could maybe get there at some point, but what I would like to see is for us to own the pieces of this process that we already own and don't do well every single year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8202.119s">[Graham]</a>: So we need to completely re-envision how we think about bus service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8207.061s">[Graham]</a>: We should not be asking families if they are gonna ride the bus, unless we know that they're eligible to ride the bus and that we have space for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8214.984s">[Graham]</a>: We know where every kid lives and we should be using that information proactively before two weeks before the start of school to be mapping routes and doing all the things that we need to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8226.33s">[Graham]</a>: So I think there's a huge amount of improvement to make all around, including with our vendor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8233.414s">[Graham]</a>: And if we need to have them come to a future meeting, I'm happy to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8237.455s">[Graham]</a>: It's a very complicated problem, but we have to own the pieces of this problem that we have failed at as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8243.097s">[Graham]</a>: And I think the communication piece of this and the planning and really just sitting back and saying, what should this process look like and when would these steps happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8252.92s">[Graham]</a>: would probably result in a completely different process than we do today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8258.164s">[Graham]</a>: So I think that is something we can actionably do, whether we have two more buses or three more buses or zero more buses, like we can get the registration process right and we're not even there yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8269.492s">[Graham]</a>: So I do think that needs to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8272.454s">[Graham]</a>: We need to not be in situations where we're sending<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8276.286s">[Graham]</a>: emails to families after the start of school, telling them, hey, change your plans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8281.827s">[Graham]</a>: Sorry, we don't actually have a bus for your kids after all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8285.188s">[Graham]</a>: We need to do better by this process for the things that we can control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8289.489s">[Graham]</a>: And it's not everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8290.509s">[Graham]</a>: We can't control how many bus drivers quit training in the week before school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8296.53s">[Graham]</a>: We can't control that, but we can control a whole lot of other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8300.732s">[Graham]</a>: I do think I would like to see some sort of analysis of like how this process should go in the future because I don't think we're there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8309.46s">[Graham]</a>: And this is extraordinarily complicated issue I get that and I appreciate that and I just want to say I know how hard people are working to try to fix.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8319.827s">[Graham]</a>: the like unexpected string of problems that are sort of unfolding as the school year unfolds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8325.673s">[Graham]</a>: And I do really, really appreciate their work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8328.195s">[Graham]</a>: We have a new coordinator of transportation in our administrative assistance unit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8333.2s">[Graham]</a>: She's learning a brand new job that never existed before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8336.838s">[Graham]</a>: and having to do this all at prime time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8339.279s">[Graham]</a>: The office is frankly probably too small to have a director that shares responsibilities with all kinds of things and this, and just one administrative assistant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8348.742s">[Graham]</a>: Like there's a lot of problems here that we need to own ourselves and try to fix and do better by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8353.623s">[Graham]</a>: Because if we could tighten all of that up, would this problem have been better?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8359.024s">[Graham]</a>: Probably.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8360.885s">[Graham]</a>: Maybe not entirely, but probably at least somewhat better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8364.486s">[Graham]</a>: And we need to do that next year because we just can't, we just, we do this every year, every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8369.49s">[Graham]</a>: It's chaos.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8370.772s">[Graham]</a>: And it seems like the chaos shifts every year, but it's still chaos.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8375.135s">[Graham]</a>: So we need to maybe try not to do chaos next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9284.521s">[Graham]</a>: Dr. Cushing, before you continue, are there any questions about what Dr. Cushing has gone through?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9288.984s">[Graham]</a>: He just did like three updates real quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9291.045s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9291.866s">[Graham]</a>: That's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9850.756s">[Graham]</a>: We don't have any presentations of the public or continued business, but we do have one item of new business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9857.961s">[Graham]</a>: It is offered by Member Rousseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9860.583s">[Graham]</a>: It's the first reading of policy AC, non-discrimination, including harassment and retaliation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9866.186s">[Graham]</a>: So I am going to read this in its entirety because I know there's some urgency to this policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9871.369s">[Graham]</a>: So the Medford School Committee and Medford Public Schools are committed to maintaining an education and work environment for all school community members free from all forms of discrimination, including harassment and retaliation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9881.534s">[Graham]</a>: School community members include school committee, employees, administration, faculty, staff, students, volunteers in the schools, and parties contracted to perform work for the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9891.715s">[Graham]</a>: The Medford Public Schools does not exclude from participation, deny the benefits of the Medford Public Schools from or otherwise discriminate against individuals on the basis of race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, religion, disability, age, genetic information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9910.442s">[Graham]</a>: active military veteran status, marital status, familial status, pregnancy or pregnancy-related condition, housing status, ancestry, ethnic background, national origin, or any other category protected by state or federal law in the administration of its educational and employment policies or in its programs and activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9929.332s">[Graham]</a>: This commitment to the community is affirmed by the following statements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9932.333s">[Graham]</a>: The Medford School Committee commits to, one, promoting the rights and responsibilities of all individuals set forth in the state and federal constitution's pertinent legislation and applicable judicial interpretations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9945.297s">[Graham]</a>: Number two, encourage positive experiences and human values for children, youth, and adults, all of whom have differing personal and family characteristics and come from various socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9957.27s">[Graham]</a>: Number three, work toward a more integrated society and enlisting the support of individuals as well as groups and agencies, both private and governmental in such an effort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9966.675s">[Graham]</a>: Number four, using all appropriate communication and action techniques to air and address the grievances of individuals and groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9973.578s">[Graham]</a>: Number five, carefully consider in all the decisions made within the school district, the potential benefits or adverse consequences of those decisions on human relations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9983.331s">[Graham]</a>: Number six, initiating the process of reviewing policies and practices of the school district to achieve to the greatest extent possible the objectives of the statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9993.339s">[Graham]</a>: The Medford Public Schools requires all members of the school community to conduct themselves in accordance with this policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9998.122s">[Graham]</a>: It shall be a violation of this policy for any member of the school community to engage in any form of discrimination, including harassment, retaliation, or to violate any other civil right of any member of the school community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10010.051s">[Graham]</a>: We recognize that discrimination can take a range of forms and can be targeted or unintentional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10014.754s">[Graham]</a>: However, discrimination in any form, including harassment and retaliation, will not be tolerated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10019.957s">[Graham]</a>: It shall also be a violation of this policy for any school community member to subject any other member of the school community to any form of retaliation, including but not limited to coercion, intimidation, interference, punishment, discrimination, or harassment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10035.705s">[Graham]</a>: for reporting or filing a complaint of discrimination, cooperating in an investigation, aiding or encouraging another member of the school committee to report such conduct or file a complaint, or opposing any act or practice reasonably believed to be prohibited by this policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10052.013s">[Graham]</a>: There is an asterisk from an earlier list about race, race to include traits historically associated with race, including but not limited to hair texture, hair type, hair length, and protective hairstyles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10065.595s">[Graham]</a>: Member Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10121.797s">[Graham]</a>: And just for context, the Title IX regulations have changed recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10128.079s">[Graham]</a>: And so this is us sort of getting into line with those new regulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10133.74s">[Graham]</a>: Is there a motion on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10135.801s">[Graham]</a>: Motion to approve the first reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10196.718s">[Graham]</a>: You said yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10198.219s">[Graham]</a>: It's late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=433.782s">[Graham]</a>: The minutes are approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=437.384s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, so flipping back to our agenda, I just wanted to give you all a couple of updates, and then we have really one topic to discuss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=445.989s">[Graham]</a>: So as you know, when we met back even in July, we talked about...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=453.534s">[Graham]</a>: that all of our documentation had been submitted and that we were awaiting information from the MSBA about the enrollment study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=462.616s">[Graham]</a>: So we have, since that time, we have met with the MSBA about our enrollment projections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=471.498s">[Graham]</a>: So if you all recall,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=475.72s">[Graham]</a>: That is a critical step in this eligibility phase because what the design enrollment is certified at that we will ultimately agree to with MSBA is how we will go forward to size the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=488.183s">[Graham]</a>: So in terms of any project that comes next, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=494.284s">[Graham]</a>: So that we all have to agree on like how many students are we trying to accommodate for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=500.145s">[Graham]</a>: We provided a whole bunch of information to them about Medford's housing market.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=505.653s">[Graham]</a>: about our historical enrollment, among other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=509.575s">[Graham]</a>: And we did hold an enrollment meeting with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=512.977s">[Graham]</a>: They presented us their preliminary numbers and they had a series of really good questions for us about what may not have like, I'll say like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=524.904s">[Graham]</a>: come through in answering the questions that they standardly pose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=530.305s">[Graham]</a>: So we had a really good conversation about some of the additional factors from Medford's perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=537.427s">[Graham]</a>: The mayor is part of the Metro Planning Council, and they are committed to helping the governor achieve their goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=545.188s">[Graham]</a>: We have an aggressive housing production plan, those kinds of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=548.009s">[Graham]</a>: So we were able to have some good conversation about a whole variety of topics that impact enrollment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=554.81s">[Graham]</a>: At the end of the conversation, they asked us for some more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=558.112s">[Graham]</a>: So we actually did provide that to them in mid-August.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=562.214s">[Graham]</a>: And we are awaiting feedback from them about the next step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=565.596s">[Graham]</a>: So more to come on getting through this last piece of the eligibility phase as we hear from them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=576.453s">[Graham]</a>: What we have done in the meantime is thanks to the help of Will Pipicelli, who's on the call, he is replacing Tom Dalton on the committee as soon as the school committee votes that change through officially, but he's here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=592.387s">[Graham]</a>: He's joined us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=593.649s">[Graham]</a>: He's our director of communications for the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=596.931s">[Graham]</a>: So I wanted to welcome him to the team unofficially and we'll welcome him officially once the committee...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=602.676s">[Graham]</a>: goes through that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=603.777s">[Graham]</a>: But Will and I have been working on two efforts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=609.38s">[Graham]</a>: One is to take all the documentation that we had to submit to MSBA around this enrollment study and put it into a digestible format.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=619.645s">[Graham]</a>: The other was to do the same with all the maintenance and capital planning information that we had to submit because all of those submissions go into their computer system and they<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=630.051s">[Graham]</a>: don't spit out all that great or with like enough context that it would sort of resonate for us to post that on our website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=637.716s">[Graham]</a>: So I believe that you all received both of those documents before the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=644.701s">[Graham]</a>: That's really just more for you to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=647.603s">[Graham]</a>: We would obviously, we do plan to post those on the website so that everybody can see them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=653.747s">[Graham]</a>: But those two documents are hot off the presses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=657.109s">[Graham]</a>: Will and I were working on finalizing them today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=660.351s">[Graham]</a>: Many, many thanks to Will for his work on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=665.013s">[Graham]</a>: Pulling together all of the information was not an easy task.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=668.535s">[Graham]</a>: There's lots of attachments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=670.716s">[Graham]</a>: The enrollment projection information is particularly sort of tedious to...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=676.212s">[Graham]</a>: to get through and understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=677.293s">[Graham]</a>: So thank you for that, Will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=680.034s">[Graham]</a>: And I want to make sure that you all saw those attachments from Lisa just a little bit ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=686.458s">[Graham]</a>: So take a look.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=687.998s">[Graham]</a>: We will post them on the website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=689.519s">[Graham]</a>: I will plan to share them out on social media.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=692.201s">[Graham]</a>: And Will and I will talk about a plan to do that from the school account instead of from my personal account so that there can be record of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=701.281s">[Graham]</a>: So I wanted to provide that update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=702.802s">[Graham]</a>: So we're still very much in wait mode.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=707.044s">[Graham]</a>: And we are waiting on those next steps from the MSBA and just ready and willing when they have questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=716.371s">[Graham]</a>: So I am planning to touch base with our contact there later this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=721.094s">[Graham]</a>: And I will let you know if there's anything material that sort of comes next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=727.718s">[Graham]</a>: Also, in terms of the timeline,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=730.764s">[Graham]</a>: Um, I'm not a hundred percent clear when we will sort of exit this phase because we are sort of at, we're at the end, but we're not done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=741.311s">[Graham]</a>: So I think some of that will drive, um, the board meeting, um, placement wherever we, um, wherever we land, once we get through this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=750.037s">[Graham]</a>: Um, the other, uh, part of the timeline is I haven't scheduled any meetings because I don't want to take up your valuable time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=756.501s">[Graham]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=758.317s">[Graham]</a>: until we have better clarity on those next steps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=762.198s">[Graham]</a>: We will talk a little bit about sort of getting ready for the next phase in just a minute, but we are going to try to use this time to provide some opportunities for folks to go tour other buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=773.981s">[Graham]</a>: We do have a tour of Arlington High School on the books for next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=777.621s">[Graham]</a>: You're all welcome to join us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=779.502s">[Graham]</a>: It's at three o'clock on the 24th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=782.883s">[Graham]</a>: The Arlington Project is...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=786.992s">[Graham]</a>: probably even more open now than it was when I went to tour the building back in like May or June because it is a phased renovation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=795.674s">[Graham]</a>: We are also working on plans to talk to Waltham, Somerville, Stoneham, and Bill Ricka.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=808.678s">[Graham]</a>: So more to come as we get those dates on the calendar and Lisa will push out invitations to you all to join us as you are able.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=817.082s">[Graham]</a>: So we're sort of taking this time where we have some quiet time to also take some tours and get inspired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=824.886s">[Graham]</a>: So that's on the immediate agenda and we'll work through getting those on the books and then we can regroup if there's anywhere else that we want to take a look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=834.45s">[Graham]</a>: Questions about the timeline?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=843.215s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, so the other major part of our agenda today is that as we start sort of looking forward to that next phase, our next, assuming that we are invited to the next phase, which is part of this MSBA process, the next phase really would be for us to...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=865.535s">[Graham]</a>: put out a public procurement and onboard our owner's project manager who will help lead this project forward as it gets increasingly technical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=874.697s">[Graham]</a>: So in order to do that under MSBA's guidelines, what we need to do is form an OPM selection committee that will help sort of get that procurement in place and out the door and shepherd that through the selection process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=894.919s">[Graham]</a>: There are certain people that have to be on the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=897.12s">[Graham]</a>: Fiona is one of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=898.38s">[Graham]</a>: I believe Bob Dickinson is another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=901.061s">[Graham]</a>: I think he has to be on the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=904.502s">[Graham]</a>: But I did want to talk about that among this group because there is also a gate that the school committee will need to approve whoever that selection committee is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=915.386s">[Graham]</a>: So even though they're a subcommittee of our committee, according to MSBA, the school committee needs to sign off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=923.288s">[Graham]</a>: So I wanted to open that up for a little bit of discussion about the sort of our best next steps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=929.652s">[Graham]</a>: Do we want to nominate folks tonight so that I can sort of be ready to feed that to the school committee when appropriate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=937.577s">[Graham]</a>: Or do we want to do that at a later meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=939.598s">[Graham]</a>: I'm open to both options, but I know the school committee agenda can be sort of big and packed at times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=946.382s">[Graham]</a>: So advanced notice would be helpful because then I have a little bit of runway to figure out how to get it on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=953.422s">[Graham]</a>: But that team, I believe, can start meeting to start to do the documentation work to put the procurement documents in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=963.836s">[Graham]</a>: So I do think if we sort of have that committee at the ready, they can be moving along because.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=971.089s">[Graham]</a>: the ultimate goal of this next phase is to get the OPM on board and then ultimately the designer or the architect, but the OPM comes first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=980.412s">[Graham]</a>: So we have to do the OPM and then the architect, and then we can get to ultimately the feasibility study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=986.313s">[Graham]</a>: So I'll stop there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=987.934s">[Graham]</a>: If anyone has any comments, questions, thoughts, I'm happy to take them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=996.156s">[Graham]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1021.966s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1024.127s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, they were invited at the same meeting we were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1040.806s">[Graham]</a>: Except those bleachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1041.986s">[Graham]</a>: But yeah, if you all haven't seen the news articles, there's an issue in their gymnasium of the newly opened school where their bleachers are too big for the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1055.7s">[Graham]</a>: gym itself and so they the bleachers come out onto the playing floor um so now that i've said that it'll be in your social media feed and you can take a look at the article but um yeah so we we are trying to um to get to to waltham um in particular i know that they just opened so they will it'll be a different aspect of like sort of their reactions to that building for sure<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1106.909s">[Graham]</a>: So part of the work of that committee is going to be to sort of follow the template set out by MSBA around the procurements and make sure that we're in good position to be in compliance with all of Medford's procurement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1123.044s">[Graham]</a>: So I think, you know...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1125.393s">[Graham]</a>: if you have procurement experience, that's a plus, because that is fundamentally what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1131.335s">[Graham]</a>: If you have experience working with OPMs, I think that is also a plus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1139.279s">[Graham]</a>: And, you know, bringing that group together, the other thing that group will do is figure out, like, what is the process that we're going to go through to actually select the OPM?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1151.604s">[Graham]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1153.354s">[Graham]</a>: I would imagine that this larger group will certainly be invited to the table to listen to presentations and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1162.301s">[Graham]</a>: But ultimately, the recommendation and the selection of the OPM is going to have to sort of go through the selection committee and then to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1171.767s">[Graham]</a>: So I think time-wise, it's going to happen in like...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1176.218s">[Graham]</a>: sort of bursts, and I can't really even tell you when the bursts will happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1181.686s">[Graham]</a>: Certainly, there's some upfront work to get those ARFPs out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1184.99s">[Graham]</a>: Once they're out, there's sort of a quiet period, right, where we have to answer some questions, and then we really can't talk about the bid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1194.024s">[Graham]</a>: And then once everything comes in, we'll have to have an established timeline to work through all of those submissions, do interviews, and ultimately make a selection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1202.95s">[Graham]</a>: So whenever that happens, it's going to be the most time intensive space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1208.313s">[Graham]</a>: Some of that will be a function of how many OPMs bid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1213.997s">[Graham]</a>: So it's really hard to know, but doing bid reviews can be really, really time consuming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1222.928s">[Graham]</a>: I do think there's a decent amount of work there for the team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1281.189s">[Graham]</a>: So there's a couple questions there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1283.11s">[Graham]</a>: One is not all people play all roles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1286.071s">[Graham]</a>: Not all organizations do all the roles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1288.011s">[Graham]</a>: Some do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1289.232s">[Graham]</a>: So some are architects and OPMs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1292.132s">[Graham]</a>: Some are just architects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1293.373s">[Graham]</a>: Some are just OPMs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1294.633s">[Graham]</a>: And any version of that could...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1298.606s">[Graham]</a>: be what we see in terms of our bid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1300.787s">[Graham]</a>: The OPM is going to help us do the heavy lifting to get the designer and the construction manager on board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1307.068s">[Graham]</a>: So this work of getting the OPM on board is our work to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1312.329s">[Graham]</a>: Once we do that, we now have somebody like paid staff that's going to help shepherd the rest of that along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1318.45s">[Graham]</a>: They certainly are going to have a wealth of information about who does this work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1324.144s">[Graham]</a>: who they've worked with before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1326.506s">[Graham]</a>: But ultimately, this committee is going to make those selections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1329.208s">[Graham]</a>: So no, there is no such thing as a forced marriage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1333.352s">[Graham]</a>: Who we hire to be the architect, who we hire to be the construction manager is up to this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1339.437s">[Graham]</a>: But the OPM, you know, ideally is the person who can help guide this committee and do the heavy lifting for us once we have them on board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1348.604s">[Graham]</a>: But it is really important to pick an OPM that sort of reflects<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1354.264s">[Graham]</a>: what we want to see as we go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1356.506s">[Graham]</a>: So, you know, finding the OPM that's a good fit for us is really, really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1369.636s">[Graham]</a>: Any other questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1384.562s">[Graham]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1385.382s">[Graham]</a>: I mean, I think as soon as we are invited to the next phase, I would like our RFP to be out the door within 30 days max, because the sooner we do that, the sooner we have somebody on board and the sooner those next phases can happen, which is why I would like to get the procurement documents created in advance of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1407.813s">[Graham]</a>: But it's really hard to say because it will be driven by when MSBA invites us to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1414.136s">[Graham]</a>: the board meeting to advance us to the next round.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1417.119s">[Graham]</a>: So those options, they meet every other month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1421.562s">[Graham]</a>: They do not meet in September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1422.923s">[Graham]</a>: So they meet in October, they meet in December and they meet in February.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1427.027s">[Graham]</a>: If I had to guess, like where I think we're likely to be at the December board meeting, there's maybe an outside chance we'll make it to October, but we're not slated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1439.297s">[Graham]</a>: We were not originally slated to go to a board meeting until I think February.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1460.342s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, I mean, I think we can have that conversation and decide who those folks are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1465.785s">[Graham]</a>: It has to go to the school committee for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1469.747s">[Graham]</a>: And I don't believe there's any reason why we can't begin work, but I will confirm that with MSBA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1475.291s">[Graham]</a>: So I think if there are people who want to be part of this process, those nominations tonight would be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1518.0s">[Graham]</a>: The next phase is forming the team, which includes the OPM and the architect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1523.703s">[Graham]</a>: Then the feasibility study happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1525.464s">[Graham]</a>: So the two things that must happen are we must have an OPM and we must have an architect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1531.926s">[Graham]</a>: And then we get invited to feasibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1534.187s">[Graham]</a>: The construction manager comes later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1537.937s">[Graham]</a>: But we so we have to get the OPM on board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1541.518s">[Graham]</a>: They will help us get the designer on board and then we will be ready for feasibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1546.459s">[Graham]</a>: So there's actually several there's a couple of MSBA gates there in the middle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1553.201s">[Graham]</a>: Because they they do have to approve our OPM, they have to approve our designer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1557.242s">[Graham]</a>: There's a lot of approvals that they have to do along the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1566.9s">[Graham]</a>: I do believe that Fiona has to be on the team and I believe Bob does, but they are both non-voting members of this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1577.044s">[Graham]</a>: So there need to be at least three voting members of the committee on this subcommittee as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1585.348s">[Graham]</a>: So I certainly will be on the committee, but I would love other folks to join us as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1602.249s">[Graham]</a>: Thanks, Libby.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1602.809s">[Graham]</a>: Is there anybody else that's dying to be on the committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1615.556s">[Graham]</a>: And that goes for non-voting members as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1620.859s">[Graham]</a>: You're very welcome to be on the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1625.578s">[Graham]</a>: We just need to make sure we have enough voting members that it can be a legitimate committee to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1656.178s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, there's definitely a circuit of folks that play in this space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1660.0s">[Graham]</a>: So we will proactively reach out to all of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1664.783s">[Graham]</a>: And they're at conferences, they're at school committee conferences and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1668.404s">[Graham]</a>: So we have plenty of opportunities to meet folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1751.268s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1752.369s">[Graham]</a>: So Aaron, maybe you can be our fourth member so that we have some flexibility in terms of having a forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1762.613s">[Graham]</a>: And sometimes you just need arms and legs, people to review, make sure things make sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1769.849s">[Graham]</a>: So I think that would be a great role for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1773.751s">[Graham]</a>: And you can learn all about the city's procurement process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1777.412s">[Graham]</a>: And then I'm sure that can be useful somewhere else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1781.774s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1782.554s">[Graham]</a>: So what I have is Jenny, Libby, Peter, Aaron, Fiona, and Bob, if Bob is required and or wants to be on the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1793.278s">[Graham]</a>: Is there anybody else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1807.269s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, I'm going to put your name down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1810.15s">[Graham]</a>: So is there a motion to approve this group?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1813.632s">[Graham]</a>: Fiona, Bob, if required, Jenny, Libby, Peter, Aaron, and John.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1818.575s">[Graham]</a>: So moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2149.334s">[Graham]</a>: So we have one, two, three, four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2151.676s">[Graham]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2153.557s">[Graham]</a>: One.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2155.598s">[Graham]</a>: Absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2156.419s">[Graham]</a>: We have a quorum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2157.96s">[Graham]</a>: Hello, Dr. Edward Vincent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2160.66s">[Graham]</a>: Hello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2161.181s">[Graham]</a>: I thought it was a separate link.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2163.203s">[Graham]</a>: I did too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2164.924s">[Graham]</a>: I signed off and back in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2166.065s">[Graham]</a>: So I did the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2169.709s">[Graham]</a>: So for this group, I did want to introduce Will formally and give him a minute to introduce himself because we will be working really closely with Will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2179.639s">[Graham]</a>: So welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2180.88s">[Graham]</a>: Will, did you want to introduce yourself?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2227.196s">[Graham]</a>: Thanks, Will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2229.489s">[Graham]</a>: So, Will and I have, as I mentioned in the last meeting, been working behind the scenes to sort of make some of those submissions a little bit more digestible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2238.532s">[Graham]</a>: All the credit to Will for doing a really fabulous job and doing it in a really quick turnaround kind of way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2244.594s">[Graham]</a>: So, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2246.694s">[Graham]</a>: And we will post those out on the website and make them available for people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2253.917s">[Graham]</a>: I think...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2255.563s">[Graham]</a>: you know, the maintenance and capital planning document is, is like dry reading, because it's about maintenance and capital planning, which is inherently not that exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2266.792s">[Graham]</a>: But there's actually like a lot of really great information in there about how the district is moving forward around maintenance, our custodial services, we have a green cleaning plan, we have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2286.751s">[Graham]</a>: an ongoing preventive maintenance plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2290.713s">[Graham]</a>: We have a lot of things now that are documented that was not always the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2297.576s">[Graham]</a>: So it's nice to be able to sort of showcase all of those things in one cohesive package.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2304.938s">[Graham]</a>: The other thing that's really enlightening about that document, I think, is when you look at some of the capital planning questions that the MSBA posed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2315.005s">[Graham]</a>: They asked questions like, how big is your maintenance budget and how big should it be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2325.515s">[Graham]</a>: if there's a gap, why is there a gap?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2328.438s">[Graham]</a>: So they really are looking for people to be good stewards of their funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2333.583s">[Graham]</a>: And they asked really good questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2336.586s">[Graham]</a>: They asked us to break things down sometimes in ways that we don't break things down in our sort of universe here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2343.672s">[Graham]</a>: So that has led to some conversations about breaking things down differently in the future, which I think is all good stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2350.578s">[Graham]</a>: And then the other document about the enrollment projection I thought was very enlightening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2357.281s">[Graham]</a>: That one took a lot of work to come together cohesively because they were seemingly very desperate things that had to be covered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2367.326s">[Graham]</a>: And we were able to, I think, do a good job of sharing in that document everything that we've provided to MSBA about our plans and some of the things that we see coming down the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2378.977s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and ultimately a justification for a building size for 1500 students plus, um, 200, um, 200 pre-K students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2391.159s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and I think, uh, another 100 kids corner, um, early childhood folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2400.681s">[Graham]</a>: So, uh, children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2402.142s">[Graham]</a>: So the total enrollment we put forward was 1800, which includes 1500 high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2409.689s">[Graham]</a>: 200 pre-K programming, and then 100 for kids scoring to sort of comprise everything that is in the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2419.856s">[Graham]</a>: So it's sort of interesting to dig in there and see some of the information that we provided them, particularly if you've ever wondered like, what are we doing in housing in Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2429.103s">[Graham]</a>: It's like a nice handy summary of those things because we really had to boil it up to provide it to MSBA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2435.527s">[Graham]</a>: So we'll get those out on the website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2438.73s">[Graham]</a>: But I did want to have some space on the agenda in case there was anything else that you all were thinking about for the website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2445.495s">[Graham]</a>: Now that we have Will on board, he'll be taking the reins on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2449.559s">[Graham]</a>: So I just wanted to open it up to the group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2451.661s">[Graham]</a>: I know there's not been tons of conversation of late in the community about this project because we've got other big things to talk about as a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2461.649s">[Graham]</a>: And I think that that will continue through November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2464.811s">[Graham]</a>: But I think just as soon as that's done and we're sort of moving on to those next gates, this will become all the conversations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2471.977s">[Graham]</a>: So I did want to like set aside just a little bit of time for us to think about like some of the planning exercises to be ready for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2479.544s">[Graham]</a>: So is there any, does anybody have any questions, comments about the website, Luke?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2539.197s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, I do believe that they play heavily in that space, as well as in general in this community engagement space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2548.543s">[Graham]</a>: So they will help drive some of the community engagement events that happen as we get into the design phase and that kind of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2612.327s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2614.578s">[Graham]</a>: Any other questions, comments, thoughts about the website?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2617.9s">[Graham]</a>: I know it's just been, you know, quiet at the moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2621.442s">[Graham]</a>: Maria?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2693.55s">[Graham]</a>: take a look through some of the model OPM procurement documents to figure out where do they fit, I guess I'll say, in the process of doing some of this work around PR, just to make sure that we have sort of an understanding of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2712.882s">[Graham]</a>: But I don't think there's really any reason why they couldn't get started in advance of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2717.125s">[Graham]</a>: I just want to double check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2718.225s">[Graham]</a>: And Maria, I will follow up with you and let you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2725.182s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2726.162s">[Graham]</a>: So the other thing I wanted to sort of circle back to that we talked about back in June was two updates, two surveys that we were going to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2736.77s">[Graham]</a>: And I wanted to sort of bring Will into the fold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2739.953s">[Graham]</a>: We had some conversation about doing a survey to all of our boards and commissions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2745.157s">[Graham]</a>: So Medford has like, I don't know, 20 or 30 boards and commissions, Will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2750.721s">[Graham]</a>: And they all have different, probably different<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2754.255s">[Graham]</a>: sort of attachments and levels of interest in the high school project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2760.602s">[Graham]</a>: Some probably have a very high interest in a lot of things about the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2764.623s">[Graham]</a>: Others may have, you know, just sort of fleeting interest or want to know different things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2769.445s">[Graham]</a>: So we did talk about creating a survey for the boards and commissions to try to get a feel for and an understanding of like where best to plug them all into the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2783.85s">[Graham]</a>: And I wanted to check in with this group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2786.151s">[Graham]</a>: I actually think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2787.731s">[Graham]</a>: now is good timing to put that survey together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2791.734s">[Graham]</a>: And we do have questions from our last meeting and give them some time in the next like six weeks or so to get back to us so that we can be prepared with that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2804.325s">[Graham]</a>: On the flip side, the FAQ survey, I have a little bit of a different opinion about, but I wanted to talk to this group about that timing and whether you think that's like the right timing for boards and commissions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2814.98s">[Graham]</a>: and whether there's like any reason for us not to pursue that sort of in the next like two months or so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2853.75s">[Graham]</a>: No, we actually had established some questions in one of our last meetings to actually push out a formal survey so that we can get some standard responses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2863.478s">[Graham]</a>: And I think if I'm remembering correctly, one of the questions is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2867.236s">[Graham]</a>: do you want somebody from the building committee to come present to you about the project?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2872.718s">[Graham]</a>: Would that be helpful for you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2874.119s">[Graham]</a>: And if so, what is your meeting schedule and that kind of thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2877.28s">[Graham]</a>: And then we'll have to do some descriptor of what we see the process as so that they can say, this is how I think I can be helpful to this project or this is the kind of...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2890.405s">[Graham]</a>: input or place in the process that I would like to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2893.426s">[Graham]</a>: So it's questions like that to help us frame when we should be reaching out to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2898.407s">[Graham]</a>: Does that make sense?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2899.968s">[Graham]</a>: And of course, we'll welcome their other questions, but it is like a defined survey set of four or five questions so that we can get a consistent response from them and then figure out how we proceed once we have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2923.003s">[Graham]</a>: Well, I think we talked about them in our last meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2925.264s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2927.725s">[Graham]</a>: And so we can certainly pull those back up and Will and I will work on that and put something together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2933.988s">[Graham]</a>: And Will, we will send a copy to this group so that you know what those questions are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2941.852s">[Graham]</a>: And if there's any comments, you can let us know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3010.186s">[Graham]</a>: The other survey that we talked about was a survey around the FAQs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3016.814s">[Graham]</a>: So really to start to ask the community, what are the kinds of questions you have about this project?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3027.245s">[Graham]</a>: given that we have a lot of other like hot topics related to schools going on in the community right now, I'm of the mind that we should defer pushing that survey out until like mid to late November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3041.688s">[Graham]</a>: And that with a goal of, you know, being able to put some of those FAQs up by the end of the year, I think it will get lost in the noise if we try to do anything sooner than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3054.451s">[Graham]</a>: Does everyone agree with that approach?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3109.858s">[Graham]</a>: Cool, so we'll...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3114.758s">[Graham]</a>: I think, roughly speaking, we'll plan to meet at some point after, like, in the mid-November timeframe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3121.683s">[Graham]</a>: Maybe we can, like, Will and I, Will can draft up the survey to be able to push out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3128.648s">[Graham]</a>: We can review it together and then make a plan to push it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3131.87s">[Graham]</a>: So I think for this group, maybe the next time we meet can be, you know, mid to late November, like mid-November-ish, post-election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3140.396s">[Graham]</a>: Does that work for everybody?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3151.403s">[Graham]</a>: And then the other thing that I do think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3156.212s">[Graham]</a>: I would like for us to work on, and it can, it can come from the, I think from the district, maybe as an attachment, Dr. Edward Vincent to your weekly email is just an update on where we are, something sort of brief that says we're done with our deliverables.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3171.861s">[Graham]</a>: You can find them all here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3174.883s">[Graham]</a>: And, you know, the next step is this, and we await that, you know, we await information from MSPA on taking that next step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3181.266s">[Graham]</a>: And in the meantime,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3182.625s">[Graham]</a>: we'll be coming to you to solicit questions and stay tuned for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3186.768s">[Graham]</a>: So something along that line so that people have an understanding of what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3249.868s">[Graham]</a>: It may not be ready for this week, but maybe next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3252.388s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3254.009s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3256.771s">[Graham]</a>: And that was it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3257.951s">[Graham]</a>: That's all I had for this group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3259.192s">[Graham]</a>: So it actually was a quick short meeting again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3262.613s">[Graham]</a>: So thank you guys for joining.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3265.014s">[Graham]</a>: Are there any other questions before we adjourn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3283.099s">[Graham]</a>: Is there a motion to adjourn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3288.355s">[Graham]</a>: By Nicole, seconded by?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3290.837s">[Graham]</a>: Seconded, Maria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3292.678s">[Graham]</a>: Maria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3294.759s">[Graham]</a>: OK, roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3295.72s">[Graham]</a>: Jenny, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3297.721s">[Graham]</a>: Nicole Morrell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3298.881s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3299.502s">[Graham]</a>: Maria Dorsey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3300.742s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3301.603s">[Graham]</a>: Will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3302.403s">[Graham]</a>: Sorry, not Will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3303.444s">[Graham]</a>: Luke Preissner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3309.688s">[Graham]</a>: Yes, Luke?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3311.129s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3311.889s">[Graham]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3313.27s">[Graham]</a>: And Marissa Desmond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3316.058s">[Graham]</a>: Absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3316.639s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3318.041s">[Graham]</a>: Four in the affirmative, one absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3320.926s">[Graham]</a>: The meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3322.909s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3323.51s">[Graham]</a>: Thanks, Jenny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3328.578s">[Graham]</a>: Thanks, Will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10146.658s">[Graham]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10231.957s">[Graham]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10233.857s">[Graham]</a>: I just want to point out that this committee, several years ago,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10239.848s">[Graham]</a>: made a resolution to make those bus passes free and that the decision to start charging for those again was not brought before this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10249.795s">[Graham]</a>: So as far as I'm concerned, there's a policy compliance issue there because we were very clear that we did not want to charge kids for those bus passes to get to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10261.523s">[Graham]</a>: I am hopeful that if the overrides are successful, we can immediately institute a change there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10267.321s">[Graham]</a>: I acknowledge that the program as it was originally envisioned may need to change, but if we're talking about transit in compliance with our policy being charged, I'm just overall not in favor of that in any regard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10285.136s">[Graham]</a>: But I do wanna point out for everybody who is new, we did this, we said it, we voted on it and it like reappeared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10292.662s">[Graham]</a>: And that was not a decision by this group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10296.738s">[Graham]</a>: we need to get back to addressing that just as soon as there's more than no money in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10303.961s">[Graham]</a>: The other thing I would like to put on the table for the administration to consider is that we should know who is parking in our school and whether we charge for it or not, every person parking in our parking lot, including staff,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10323.228s">[Graham]</a>: should have to have a parking permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10325.01s">[Graham]</a>: They should have to be registered with the school with a license plate and a car that they're going to be driving to school without exception.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10333.221s">[Graham]</a>: And then obviously you deal with visitors sort of separately and there's visitor parking now that's very well signed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10339.59s">[Graham]</a>: So...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10340.671s">[Graham]</a>: that should be happening i'm surprised it's not frankly because we have no way of knowing which of those cars are there um in a in a way that is consistent with what we're trying to do in the building so that is maybe a separate issue i would like to hear a report on at some point in time but um it doesn't that that parking permit does not have to come with the fee necessarily um depending on how this vote goes tonight but i i would be absolutely in favor of making sure that we understand<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10369.377s">[Graham]</a>: who is driving cars onto the campus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10418.348s">[Graham]</a>: Motion to approve the senior decorate your parking space $75 fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11007.415s">[Graham]</a>: So the school committee does have graduation requirements outlined in the handbook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11012.598s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10433.796s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10434.836s">[Graham]</a>: Can you tell me a little bit about where the content for Caregiver University comes from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10440.16s">[Graham]</a>: Like, are we creating content?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10441.862s">[Graham]</a>: Are we buying content?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10499.51s">[Graham]</a>: And is it videos?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10501.671s">[Graham]</a>: Is it actual e-learning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10504.672s">[Graham]</a>: Is it seminars?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10507.493s">[Graham]</a>: Can I watch this stuff any time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10510.053s">[Graham]</a>: Or how do I consume it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10607.054s">[Graham]</a>: So I guess what I would like to see is that there's like a central place where all of this content can live.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10615.176s">[Graham]</a>: Like the athletics night is a great example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10617.316s">[Graham]</a>: It was mandatory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10618.237s">[Graham]</a>: I was unable to attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10622.918s">[Graham]</a>: I don't know how I,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10624.955s">[Graham]</a>: address that as a parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10626.596s">[Graham]</a>: But no one's followed up with me either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10628.138s">[Graham]</a>: So that would be like an example of, yes, it's in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10632.901s">[Graham]</a>: Yes, you want people to come in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10635.303s">[Graham]</a>: But what, like, what can this platform do for us to make sure that actually the parents who couldn't, I think there might have been a school committee, something at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10645.851s">[Graham]</a>: So who can't come for whatever the reason might be still get the content that is happening in those<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10653.806s">[Graham]</a>: important meetings, because like you said, people are busy, they people need to be able to consume content, sort of when it's convenient for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10660.829s">[Graham]</a>: But I think in some cases, we also need to know that they consumed content, like, every time I register Lucas for sports, there's like 100 pages of waivers, and 100 things I'm supposed to like, view and watch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10677.716s">[Graham]</a>: And I actually make an effort to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10680.137s">[Graham]</a>: But it is extremely easy to just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10683.587s">[Graham]</a>: scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, and click that I have done it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10688.491s">[Graham]</a>: But if what the district is seeking is like cover, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10694.035s">[Graham]</a>: You know, so if Lucas gets a concussion, like I, you have my signature that I've done something, but there's no evidence that you can point to that I actually did or didn't scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, click, sign my name and I'm done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10710.027s">[Graham]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10710.368s">[Graham]</a>: So I think there's like compliance and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10713.703s">[Graham]</a>: what we want, you know, from a requirements perspective as we think about all of this going forward, but then there's actually like, did it sink in or did it stick in any way, shape or form?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10726.752s">[Graham]</a>: And was the thing that was really important actually delivered?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10732.356s">[Graham]</a>: And I would argue that when you sign your kids up for sports, that is not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10736.318s">[Graham]</a>: Like the thing you needed parents to know when they like rolled out of that sign up, it's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10743.553s">[Graham]</a>: It's not the takeaway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10745.975s">[Graham]</a>: The takeaway is, wow, this system is bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10748.276s">[Graham]</a>: And it is really tedious and time consuming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10751.619s">[Graham]</a>: And I'm glad that's over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10753.24s">[Graham]</a>: So I want to see parents be educated about these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10756.923s">[Graham]</a>: And I think parents genuinely want to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10759.224s">[Graham]</a>: But I think we have to do a better job of delivering that content for parents to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10763.767s">[Graham]</a>: So I'm hoping that we can address some of that when we are thinking about the build out of this parent and caregiver university, because I think it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10771.795s">[Graham]</a>: it's very needed for all kinds of reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12414.149s">[Graham]</a>: Member Graham, then Member Reinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12415.55s">[Graham]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12419.488s">[Graham]</a>: There was some commentary on social media in the last week or so about whether or not the district provides DIBLS results.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12430.917s">[Graham]</a>: And the general consensus of the parents was you had to ask for those results.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12438.102s">[Graham]</a>: But it doesn't sound like that based on what you just said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12440.824s">[Graham]</a>: So I'm just trying to understand clearly, like, who gets results?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12445.908s">[Graham]</a>: Does everyone get results?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12448.164s">[Graham]</a>: and if not, why not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12488.477s">[Graham]</a>: And so what does it mean to be at risk?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12491.619s">[Graham]</a>: Like, is there like a threshold?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12497.303s">[Graham]</a>: And is there a reason why we would not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12499.505s">[Graham]</a>: just give everybody their results.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12501.886s">[Graham]</a>: Because basically what's happening on social media is sort of a push to go everybody as individuals to the principal to request the results.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12510.45s">[Graham]</a>: And that seems like it is going to be far more complicated than if we just gave parents the results that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12593.937s">[Graham]</a>: For two to five?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12604.163s">[Graham]</a>: Got it, got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12606.165s">[Graham]</a>: And on this chart where we have in our packet the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12611.636s">[Graham]</a>: whether schools are title one, how many total students there are, how many reading teachers there are in the grades that the reading teachers are servicing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12620.06s">[Graham]</a>: Is there a way to add to that chart, like the number of students who are at risk?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12623.882s">[Graham]</a>: Because if you just look at the numbers, there's a huge distribution of how much support is happening in buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12631.705s">[Graham]</a>: And if that's really perfectly aligned with like the number of students who need support, and then there's like even out caseloads, that makes some sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12640.904s">[Graham]</a>: but if you just look strictly at like total population it's hard to understand like are we doing are there enough reading teachers in our district and are they deployed in the right places?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12730.659s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, and I think I think that breakdown would be helpful and it would be helpful next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12739.517s">[Graham]</a>: for us, like, or, and I'm not even sure that this is the right, like, exact time of year to look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12745.542s">[Graham]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12745.982s">[Graham]</a>: Maybe, maybe it's like a look back for last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12748.004s">[Graham]</a>: I'm not sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12748.945s">[Graham]</a>: But like, whatever the thing is that we land on is like, this is when we're going to look at this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12754.869s">[Graham]</a>: What you would ideally see over time as this curriculum takes hold, right, and matures in the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12762.315s">[Graham]</a>: And if we are being successful in our efforts to keep, to do more,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12770.276s">[Graham]</a>: sort of holistic instruction at tier one, there should be fewer students over time who need these services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12777.942s">[Graham]</a>: And it would be ideal to be able to see that in this chart somehow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12782.926s">[Graham]</a>: So like last year we had a hundred students at risk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12786.79s">[Graham]</a>: This year we have 90.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12788.331s">[Graham]</a>: Like, so because, and I know it gets like very wild and complicated when you're talking about all the grades and all the things, but there has to, I feel like one of the things we don't do that well as a district is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12800.663s">[Graham]</a>: give people a concise way to say, are we making progress?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12805.025s">[Graham]</a>: So I know that we have talked a lot about moving the need to where the need is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12809.667s">[Graham]</a>: And so I'm making an assumption that that's why these numbers look so strange.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12813.769s">[Graham]</a>: Like if you really calculate the math, it intuitively makes sense to me based on what I know about each of those school buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12821.593s">[Graham]</a>: But I want the data to actually just make that clear for everybody who just may not tune into these meetings every<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12830.165s">[Graham]</a>: You know, for four or five hours every other Monday night so, so I think there's like a couple of things there from like a historical and data perspective that would be helpful to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12841.983s">[Graham]</a>: As we think about like this work and are we making progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12885.519s">[Graham]</a>: And then we know, well, I think that's a good, that's a good question, which is like, when is the right time to have some of these conversations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12893.245s">[Graham]</a>: This maybe is too early.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12895.504s">[Graham]</a>: if you want to look at what's happening, like from the beginning of the year to the end of the year, if you don't yet have the data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12901.447s">[Graham]</a>: The other thing that's interesting, we were looking at cohort survival models for MSBA enrollment purposes, and it was easy to see a cohort move through the ranks, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12918.737s">[Graham]</a>: So you could see in this year, there were 100 kindergartners, and next year there were<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12924.871s">[Graham]</a>: 99 first graders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12925.691s">[Graham]</a>: And then the year after that, there were 102 second graders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12928.654s">[Graham]</a>: So you could sort of see that progression.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12932.356s">[Graham]</a>: And I feel like that is like a really complicated data view.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12935.939s">[Graham]</a>: I don't know if the tools that you're using can provide something like that, but to be able to see a cohort improve over time, I think would actually tell the story that like this all works, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12946.327s">[Graham]</a>: So we had X number of kids in kindergarten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12948.929s">[Graham]</a>: We had fewer kids in first grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12950.67s">[Graham]</a>: We had fewer kids in second grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12952.772s">[Graham]</a>: And by third grade,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12954.278s">[Graham]</a>: we had even fewer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12955.359s">[Graham]</a>: So that's, I think what I would want to see from this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12958.701s">[Graham]</a>: And if that means that this is not the right time of year to get this presentation, it's also not my personal goal to make you come to as many school committee meetings as possible to talk about literacy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12969.248s">[Graham]</a>: So if there's a better time of year for you to come where like a better story is available, like I am all ears for that because this group, this,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12980.734s">[Graham]</a>: meeting has no shortage of topics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12982.775s">[Graham]</a>: So we just want to make good use of your time and the data that's available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13406.241s">[Graham]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13408.121s">[Graham]</a>: Can I just say thank you to the Council for moving quickly on this ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13413.483s">[Graham]</a>: It's really important<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13415.703s">[Graham]</a>: that schools have hot water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13417.304s">[Graham]</a>: I think that goes without saying, but also when you need to spend $267,000, like you need the cooperation of the Council and the Stabilization Fund to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13430.691s">[Graham]</a>: So I just wanted to say thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13522.289s">[Graham]</a>: Motion to waive the second reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13525.052s">[Graham]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13589.827s">[Graham]</a>: Member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13590.748s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13592.73s">[Graham]</a>: We had a meeting back in March where we discussed a whole series of questions and those questions never quite came like back around to us so I just want to make sure that they do and I also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13608.847s">[Graham]</a>: would like to be clear about some of these questions and where we are versus where we've been because I've had a number of parents in the last couple weeks tell me we've made no progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13619.355s">[Graham]</a>: I don't actually think that's true, but I believe that that is what it looks like because we don't provide data in a way that allows people to understand what progress looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13628.385s">[Graham]</a>: So I would like to, I'm totally open to when between now and the end of December, you need to be able to provide this report, which is why I didn't put a date, a requested date on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13640.937s">[Graham]</a>: But I do think it's important for us to have this conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13644.24s">[Graham]</a>: It's a continuing issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13646.201s">[Graham]</a>: And some of these questions are really trying to get at what does solving this problem look like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13652.808s">[Graham]</a>: I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13653.621s">[Graham]</a>: that looks different depending on who you talk to, but I think this will help us maybe have a conversation and help the community be part of that conversation as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13664.313s">[Graham]</a>: Yes, Dr. Edward-Vincent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13695.327s">[Graham]</a>: Well, what I want to be able to see is if there's 100 kids on the waitlist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13699.589s">[Graham]</a>: I don't know if there's 100, but if there's 100, are 99 of them enrolled elsewhere in the city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13705.893s">[Graham]</a>: Because I think as a community, we have always thought of solving the afterschool problem as a thing that Medford Public Schools has to do on its own.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13714.418s">[Graham]</a>: And thanks to lots of advocacy from lots of parents, there actually are other programs now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13720.344s">[Graham]</a>: They have created other problems for us to solve, which is why I want to know, what is the size and context of the problem?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13726.31s">[Graham]</a>: So I just want to know, if there's 100 kids,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13735.539s">[Graham]</a>: Are they all enrolled somewhere else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13737.944s">[Graham]</a>: Are they half enrolled somewhere else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13739.728s">[Graham]</a>: And I know that we have that data because we bused them, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13742.734s">[Graham]</a>: So I'm just trying to understand clearly what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13747.469s">[Graham]</a>: it is that we are trying to solve for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13750.55s">[Graham]</a>: And if what we're trying to solve for is transportation so that we can continue to promote other programs in our community, like everybody else has for like decades and decades, where we're just sort of starting that process, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13765.017s">[Graham]</a>: That's a different solution than continuing to sort of bump up against, is it 80 or 100 kids in a building?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13772.48s">[Graham]</a>: And we keep hearing 100 is too many, but we keep saying, but we do it in one building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13777.523s">[Graham]</a>: And we're like around and around the circle, which is fine if what we haven't done is agree on like what the problems are that we're trying to solve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13788.248s">[Graham]</a>: And I think we're just trying to make it better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13791.569s">[Graham]</a>: So I don't think we've been very targeted in our like solutions and maybe that's okay because it means we're trying like every which way that we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13799.847s">[Graham]</a>: I just would like us to be clear and to be able to see the data over time, which I don't think we've really ever been able to do all that well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13810.413s">[Graham]</a>: I'm happy to work with whoever, as they create the report, if there's help I can provide or I'm totally happy to help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=0.109s">[Graham]</a>: As importantly, thank you everybody else who's here because you all are the reason why we do the work that we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=7.968s">[Graham]</a>: This is a historic moment for Medford Public Schools, and it's one that we have to soak in and really take advantage of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=15.875s">[Graham]</a>: When I ran for office in 2019, which is 100 dog years ago, it seemed like part of the reason I ran is because I would go to school committee meetings, and the hard questions about what do we need and don't have, those questions never were asked, and they certainly weren't answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=34.15s">[Graham]</a>: That is one of the many reasons why I ran.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=37.132s">[Graham]</a>: Once I got elected and I started on the school committee, we started having budget meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=41.635s">[Graham]</a>: The first thing I said was, what is the process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=43.636s">[Graham]</a>: How does this work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=44.376s">[Graham]</a>: How do we know what we need versus how do we know how much we have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=48.298s">[Graham]</a>: There were a lot of blank stares in the room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=50.039s">[Graham]</a>: There were a lot of people who were like, what do you mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=54.102s">[Graham]</a>: I said, how do we know what we need?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=56.463s">[Graham]</a>: does it just always magically match every year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=59.764s">[Graham]</a>: And everyone sort of said, yeah, it does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=63.166s">[Graham]</a>: And I said, okay, well, if you talk to the community, they talk a lot about what we don't have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=67.488s">[Graham]</a>: So this can't be true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=70.889s">[Graham]</a>: So from that moment on, I've been on a quest to be more intentional about describing the budget in terms of what we would need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=79.933s">[Graham]</a>: That year in the middle of the onset of COVID, we started simple and we just said to the department heads, what are three to five things you could do that would improve student outcomes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=92.125s">[Graham]</a>: How much did the list cost?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=95.348s">[Graham]</a>: Anybody, any guesses?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=97.851s">[Graham]</a>: You know, any guesses?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=102.566s">[Graham]</a>: not that much, but $10 million, a cool $10 million without a lot of strategic thinking, without a lot of time to really think deeply about that question because they were also in the middle of shutting down school and trying to figure out this virtual learning thing, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=118.938s">[Graham]</a>: So a cool $10 million just like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=122.661s">[Graham]</a>: Ever since then, we have taken more strategic approaches to get to that same question, and it changes a little bit every year how we do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=129.367s">[Graham]</a>: But the answer is always about $10 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=132.73s">[Graham]</a>: The answer of what we need and don't have is always significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=138.655s">[Graham]</a>: And it's changed, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=140.017s">[Graham]</a>: So we aren't talking about needing Chromebooks for every student anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=143.159s">[Graham]</a>: We were in 2020.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=144.981s">[Graham]</a>: That's changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=146.081s">[Graham]</a>: Now we're talking about we need money to replace those Chromebooks that we bought in 2020 because it's not an option to not have technology anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=154.505s">[Graham]</a>: So as I think about this work that we're doing, I'm excited to let people be free to really think about what could improve student outcomes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=166.789s">[Graham]</a>: What do we need that we don't have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=169.69s">[Graham]</a>: And this moment is a huge start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=174.912s">[Graham]</a>: If you were paying attention this spring, you know that the budget was bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=179.115s">[Graham]</a>: It was dire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=181.116s">[Graham]</a>: The MPS administration was asked to lay out sort of what would it take to meet the city's available allocation and they laid out a devastating list of cuts and we were still 2.7 million dollars<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=194.304s">[Graham]</a>: away from that number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=196.786s">[Graham]</a>: So when you talk about 2.7 million more dollars, nothing is safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=202.85s">[Graham]</a>: Class size, athletics, extracurriculars, buses, the arts, the list goes on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=208.613s">[Graham]</a>: 2.7 million dollars is a big, big number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=211.375s">[Graham]</a>: And that's in addition to all of the other cuts that they could lay out for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=217.336s">[Graham]</a>: I'm super grateful that my fellow finance task force members voiced their unwavering support when I said, we can't live through this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=226.359s">[Graham]</a>: This is too deep for Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=230.24s">[Graham]</a>: And we were able to work with the task force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=234.801s">[Graham]</a>: I'm grateful to every city department that ratcheted back what they wanted out of the budget so that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=240.762s">[Graham]</a>: the situation at Medford Public Schools could be a little less bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=244.064s">[Graham]</a>: And that's what we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=245.064s">[Graham]</a>: It was less bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=246.885s">[Graham]</a>: I'm also grateful for one-time funds because that all allowed us to do some things in a stopgap way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=254.488s">[Graham]</a>: We were able to save two literacy interventionists, four department heads, three behavior specialists, one nurse, two elementary school teachers, and a facilities maintenance budget that was a little less anemic than in years past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=267.034s">[Graham]</a>: So that's what we did with one-time funds, but that's one time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=270.917s">[Graham]</a>: That means that all of those things are on the chopping block again next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=277.061s">[Graham]</a>: There's no more one-time funds to fill this void.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=281.684s">[Graham]</a>: So let's talk about November because that's actually a more fun thing to talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=286.433s">[Graham]</a>: We're going to do two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=287.754s">[Graham]</a>: The first thing we're going to do is stabilize the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=290.416s">[Graham]</a>: What does that mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=291.857s">[Graham]</a>: We're going to stop the potential of that hole that we've created with one-time funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=299.801s">[Graham]</a>: We're going to close that gap and we're going to close it for good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=303.503s">[Graham]</a>: Those critical staff members I just talked about, we're going to put them in a position where they can continue to support our students the way that they need to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=311.528s">[Graham]</a>: The stabilizing money will also fund our technology replacement budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=315.251s">[Graham]</a>: It's 2024, and it's not an option to not have technology anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=320.416s">[Graham]</a>: It will also allow us to restore an administrative assistant at the McGlynn School, where we have one administrative assistant managing two school buildings and supporting two principals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=328.622s">[Graham]</a>: It's a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=329.863s">[Graham]</a>: And she's going to do it, and she's going to be amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=332.566s">[Graham]</a>: But that is a stopgap situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=335.808s">[Graham]</a>: So we're looking forward to being able to do something to address that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=339.252s">[Graham]</a>: And it will also this stabilization money will ensure that we never have to find out what that $2.7 million would actually look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=347.317s">[Graham]</a>: So that's one thing we're going to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=348.378s">[Graham]</a>: We're going to stabilize the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=349.819s">[Graham]</a>: We're going to stop doing this one time thing where we don't have enough to even get by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=356.826s">[Graham]</a>: yay but as importantly we're going to invest in the future so we're going to do more than just run in place we are going to do more and the list of possibilities is long and you probably all have your own list of what you think is possible or what you think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=379.442s">[Graham]</a>: would be useful and so I brought my list just to give you a flavor of what was I thinking about when I sat in those meetings and we arrived at these numbers where we were going to ask for the community to bring seven million more dollars to MPS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=394.093s">[Graham]</a>: So here's a few.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=395.895s">[Graham]</a>: Our vocational students deserve access to the arts and AP classes and they shouldn't have to take Spanish or any other language online because the schedule is simply incompatible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=405.842s">[Graham]</a>: That is what happens today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=409.389s">[Graham]</a>: Fixing it is a huge undertaking and it's gonna change the structure of the school day and the schedule for every single student at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=416.233s">[Graham]</a>: So it's a big deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=418.574s">[Graham]</a>: All of our students deserve more time for learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=421.475s">[Graham]</a>: We have the shortest school day around and it's time for Medford to do more than the minimum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=429.979s">[Graham]</a>: More students deserve access to transportation because two miles is too far to walk to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=439.184s">[Graham]</a>: It doesn't matter how old you are, that's a long walk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=443.348s">[Graham]</a>: Our staff deserve investment in high quality professional development and support as they develop their craft as educators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=450.976s">[Graham]</a>: Our paras deserve a living and competitive wage and so do our teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=456.004s">[Graham]</a>: This is a big deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=456.924s">[Graham]</a>: We've made a lot of progress for our paraprofessionals, but there's so much to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=462.467s">[Graham]</a>: Our athletes, our extracurricular participants, they deserve the very best opportunities we can provide, and that starts with increasing our coaching and advisor stipends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=472.613s">[Graham]</a>: They have not been addressed in a decade or more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=476.835s">[Graham]</a>: They are fractional compared to the time that our advisors and our coaches put into our students, and we need to do something about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=486.102s">[Graham]</a>: Our buildings deserve maintenance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=489.952s">[Graham]</a>: It's the most boring thing, but it's so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=493.835s">[Graham]</a>: The project to replace the HVAC system at McGlynn and Andrews is $20 million alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=499.938s">[Graham]</a>: $20 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=501.279s">[Graham]</a>: So that project is ongoing, but $20 million will be spent on that project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=507.924s">[Graham]</a>: And that's just so that those buildings can have acceptable HVAC systems, and it's not too hot to learn in September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=518.67s">[Graham]</a>: just this morning I got a list of immediate repair needs that are happening that are happening across the district as we prepare for the start of school it was a cool half million dollars right there so the need across the school our buildings are all new but they're aging our buildings are new but they're 20 years old and that means their their systems are at the end of life so we have to be prepared to do something different than we've done all along<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=543.625s">[Graham]</a>: we have to maintain what we have so we don't have to do this again because I think that's critically important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=550.068s">[Graham]</a>: Certainly the Medford High School project is a bit of a separate matter than what we're talking about tonight if anyone wants to have if anyone has questions about the Medford High building project please let me know I'm happy to answer them after this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=562.013s">[Graham]</a>: So the list goes on that's my list I've probably already spent seven million dollars so I'll stop there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=568.376s">[Graham]</a>: And I know we all have a list, and I think that's really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=573.159s">[Graham]</a>: So when we do this in November, the next thing that happens is we start talking about now what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=580.324s">[Graham]</a>: What is the plan, and how are we going to best use this money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=583.546s">[Graham]</a>: And I want to see all of you at that table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=585.867s">[Graham]</a>: That's a very public process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=587.669s">[Graham]</a>: It happens on the floor, out in the open, in the light of day, so that we can hear from people about what those priorities are and what they think is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=595.934s">[Graham]</a>: But first, we have to get there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=167.756s">[Graham]</a>: Hi, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=168.356s">[Graham]</a>: I'm Jenny Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=169.797s">[Graham]</a>: I'm the vice chair of the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=172.339s">[Graham]</a>: This is my fifth year on the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=175.861s">[Graham]</a>: So I started January 2020.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=178.222s">[Graham]</a>: And I am really excited about this very historic opportunity for us to do what we've been talking about for five years as we have navigated<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=193.294s">[Graham]</a>: Terrible budgets for our schools and our kids and really to say to the community that we are asking the community to tell us that they value education as much as that they have told us for the last 5 budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=208.751s">[Graham]</a>: So I'm super excited about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=212.435s">[Graham]</a>: I think there's a lot of questions out out in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=216.44s">[Graham]</a>: I'm so happy that you're all here and hopefully we can answer some of those most pressing questions as we go tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=223.829s">[Graham]</a>: So I will turn it over to Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=719.974s">[Graham]</a>: start and Paul, please add to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=724.858s">[Graham]</a>: So I think there's a couple of things that we we know for sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=728.68s">[Graham]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=729.021s">[Graham]</a>: So we know that in last year's budget, we relied on one time funds to prevent some of the cuts that were articulated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=740.489s">[Graham]</a>: So if you were following the last budget season, the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=746.934s">[Graham]</a>: The CFO and our budget, our now budget director, Jerry McHugh, was directed to make the budget lean because we knew that we were coming off of our ability to use ESSER funds, which are COVID-related relief funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=767.251s">[Graham]</a>: And we knew that the budget was going to be tight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=773.366s">[Graham]</a>: He laid out a series of cuts, essentially, that were very unpopular and unfavorable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=784.415s">[Graham]</a>: And they included things like two literacy interventionists, two behavior specialists who work with our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=796.921s">[Graham]</a>: 1 nurse, 4 teachers, 4 department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=800.924s">[Graham]</a>: So those positions alone are worth like 1.1 million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=807.387s">[Graham]</a>: He laid out obviously more than 1.1 million dollars worth of cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=812.891s">[Graham]</a>: He laid out, I think, somewhere in the neighborhood of 2.3 million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=817.853s">[Graham]</a>: In cuts, some of the cuts actually happened, but thanks to the finance task force working with me and the mayor, we were able to get agreement that we would use some 1 time funds from the city in order to make the whole, like, not so bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=838.959s">[Graham]</a>: So, the, the cuts that Jerry laid out in terms of what the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=843.3s">[Graham]</a>: Possibilities were were sort of deep and devastating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=846.881s">[Graham]</a>: And he was also articulating at that time that there was still $2.7 million of a gap between what the city thought the budget could possibly be and what.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=861.954s">[Graham]</a>: we felt like was needed to avoid cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=864.856s">[Graham]</a>: So all the positions that he talked about lost 2.7 million more dollars were on the table in cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=873.241s">[Graham]</a>: We saved many of those cuts from based on some of the one-time funds and really at the expense of many other city departments who had to go back and slim back their budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=885.428s">[Graham]</a>: And that's a recurring theme in Medford where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=889.19s">[Graham]</a>: the school costs are accelerating I would say more quickly than sort of anywhere else in the city's budget and what I've seen in the last five years is that when something more than two and a half percent is able to come to the schools it's at the expense of another city department and there's there's just no more for the city departments to cut or give it's why the DPW<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=914.369s">[Graham]</a>: Is struggling to handle our roads and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=918.173s">[Graham]</a>: It's why we almost didn't have Saturdays in the library.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=922.477s">[Graham]</a>: Like, all of those things come because there's just the pie is only so big for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=927.561s">[Graham]</a>: And there's only so much that we can do to direct money to the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=931.785s">[Graham]</a>: And it is happening at the expense of all the other things that we would like to see in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=936.93s">[Graham]</a>: So this year we were able to plug part of the whole with one-time funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=942.834s">[Graham]</a>: It was about $1.75 million in one-time funds and additional money that came at the expense of other city departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=952.34s">[Graham]</a>: So what we know for sure is that that $1.75 million is not available next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=959.505s">[Graham]</a>: That's the sort of very definition of one-time funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=962.347s">[Graham]</a>: So we know that there will be cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=967.029s">[Graham]</a>: If these overrides don't pass, because there, there just is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=971.831s">[Graham]</a>: Nowhere else to to collect that money from so we certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=976.493s">[Graham]</a>: Could imagine that we might get a 2 and a half percent increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=981.634s">[Graham]</a>: Like, 90, something percent of our costs are fixed either by contract or by things like our utilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=989.434s">[Graham]</a>: They're all accelerating faster than 2 and a half percent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=992.636s">[Graham]</a>: So there's just no, there's no wiggle room there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=994.597s">[Graham]</a>: There's, there's no room to say, but we want to keep these extra people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=998.178s">[Graham]</a>: So we know that that will happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1000.88s">[Graham]</a>: What exact positions are very much that's sort of the ugly question we will grapple with if we.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1007.503s">[Graham]</a>: Um, don't see these override succeed and so is it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1010.724s">[Graham]</a>: 1 nurse or 2 nurses is it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1013.485s">[Graham]</a>: 2 behavior specialists or 3, all of those would be questions we'd be sort of asking and answering in the next budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1020.748s">[Graham]</a>: Um, but we also, we know that we.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1025.069s">[Graham]</a>: are not doing things today that we have to do, like maintain our technology, whether that's Chromebooks, laptops for teachers, any of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1035.138s">[Graham]</a>: We know we're not doing that today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1037.32s">[Graham]</a>: And if we don't do that next year, we will no longer have technology for students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1043.365s">[Graham]</a>: And as we look to what we need to educate students,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1048.462s">[Graham]</a>: Technology is on the must have list so that means that that money that half 1Million dollars that we need for technology next year would have to come from somewhere else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1057.97s">[Graham]</a>: So there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1059.752s">[Graham]</a>: In our budget, 80 ish, 85% of our costs are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1065.257s">[Graham]</a>: For staff, so when you talk about cutting the budget, there's just very little that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1072.782s">[Graham]</a>: discretionary in any way, unless you consider staff discretionary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1077.064s">[Graham]</a>: I don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1078.804s">[Graham]</a>: But we would be looking at some very, very difficult decisions were it to come to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1085.347s">[Graham]</a>: And we've done that before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1087.668s">[Graham]</a>: And it's ugly each and every time we do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1093.09s">[Graham]</a>: And we are the only city department since I have started that has said goodbye to humans who work in our department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1100.233s">[Graham]</a>: So other departments have seen cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1102.934s">[Graham]</a>: They've seen sort of flatlining, but we have said goodbye to people who work in our district in service to our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1111.839s">[Graham]</a>: And there would be more of that before there would be less if the overpits don't pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1476.006s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, so a couple of things that we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1479.848s">[Graham]</a>: Eliminate this year, our director of data reporting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1485.53s">[Graham]</a>: Was eliminated by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1490.365s">[Graham]</a>: Six, five or six, I'm not remembering exactly, administrative assistant positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1496.984s">[Graham]</a>: were eliminated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1499.045s">[Graham]</a>: There's at least one of them is on high on my list personally to come back because the McGlynn complex is working with one administrative assistant right now for a thousand kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1511.873s">[Graham]</a>: That's not okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1514.714s">[Graham]</a>: That is a huge, it's a huge ask and a big lift.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1518.297s">[Graham]</a>: So there are some administrative assistant positions that we could look at to say what needs to come back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1526.437s">[Graham]</a>: Literacy interventionists, we.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1530.299s">[Graham]</a>: We're able to bring, I think, 3 back into the budget, but we needed 4. we only have 2 right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1536.822s">[Graham]</a>: We do have 1 open position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1539.384s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and then there were, um, there ended up being 1 elimination from the administrators union.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1547.73s">[Graham]</a>: Um, so I don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1551.032s">[Graham]</a>: Think that's like, super high on our list because the work has been distributed, but that would certainly be subject of a discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1558.538s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and then there were some changes to the portfolio of, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1566.336s">[Graham]</a>: of teachers at each of our buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1569.058s">[Graham]</a>: And that number change, you know, whatever, whatever we talked about in May, and then in June, and what actually transpired at the start of the year is very much a function of like how the enrollment comes through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1581.584s">[Graham]</a>: So I do think there are some classrooms that are bigger than they have historically done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1587.306s">[Graham]</a>: And we're sort of always watching those class sizes because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1593.534s">[Graham]</a>: Once you put too many kids in a classroom, it becomes incredibly hard for all the kids to get what they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1599.599s">[Graham]</a>: And we would be looking at that and maybe able to return to some of those other questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1605.884s">[Graham]</a>: But there's a whole bunch of other things that we've never been able to talk about doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1610.667s">[Graham]</a>: And I know that representatives from our teachers union was at, were at one of our early meetings this year asking us to address the overcrowding issues at the Roberts Elementary School specifically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1623.717s">[Graham]</a>: There is no more space at that school and we continue to see enrollment climb.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1630.038s">[Graham]</a>: So there are other things that we are going to have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1634.539s">[Graham]</a>: So they may not be about like bringing back a position that was cut, but talking about finally being able to fund a position that's always been needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1644.462s">[Graham]</a>: So that those two things are both possibilities for this when we pass this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1672.961s">[Graham]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1675.234s">[Graham]</a>: A couple of so question 8.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1678.796s">[Graham]</a>: Provides us an opportunity to talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1681.618s">[Graham]</a>: What we should do, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1683.359s">[Graham]</a>: Like, what what have we never been able to do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1685.381s">[Graham]</a>: We should do and we actually have been having this conversation in budget seasons for as long as I've been here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1694.307s">[Graham]</a>: And there's a shortage of good ideas about things that would benefit students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1700.013s">[Graham]</a>: But the things that are sort of, I'll say highest on the list are things like living wages for all of our staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1708.901s">[Graham]</a>: And so when I say a living wage, I mean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1714.179s">[Graham]</a>: raising people up out of the minimum wage category, where many of our positions have existed for a really long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1722.605s">[Graham]</a>: We've made a lot of progress in moving out of that minimum wage territory, but we are not yet at what is considered a living wage for somebody who lives in this area and works in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1736.974s">[Graham]</a>: We also, and like, 1 of the biggest and most important things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1742.695s">[Graham]</a>: For our district is to finish the integration of our high school and our vocational school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1749.176s">[Graham]</a>: So, the 2 schools used to operate completely separately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1752.057s">[Graham]</a>: They were listed as 2 different schools with the Department of elementary and secondary education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1757.998s">[Graham]</a>: They were merged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1759.678s">[Graham]</a>: Some years ago, 6, 7 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1763.797s">[Graham]</a>: But the two schedules were never integrated in such a way that students could move seamlessly between the two buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1773.32s">[Graham]</a>: That's very complicated work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1776.701s">[Graham]</a>: We have been at it for a good number of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1779.923s">[Graham]</a>: I think we finally are at the place where we have a path forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1785.284s">[Graham]</a>: And that will allow things like our vocational students to have space in their schedule to access<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1793.107s">[Graham]</a>: Um, the arts or world language, my daughter is in the vocational program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1799.169s">[Graham]</a>: Um, now she's a 10th grader in the robotics and engineering program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1803.93s">[Graham]</a>: She has to take Spanish in line after school to meet her world language requirement because there's no space in her schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1811.572s">[Graham]</a>: For Spanish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1814.398s">[Graham]</a>: All of that gets fixed with changes to the schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1818.601s">[Graham]</a>: And it's a very complicated set of changes because we still have to and want to preserve what makes our vocational school so unique and special.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1829.367s">[Graham]</a>: We have students who come out who are halfway to licensure, who are like a year ahead of their peers coming out of high school, going into certain trades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1840.013s">[Graham]</a>: All of that requires a completely different schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1843.034s">[Graham]</a>: So the integration of the two schedules is critically important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1846.994s">[Graham]</a>: It's going to change the structure of the school day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1849.575s">[Graham]</a>: It's going to change the amount of time that happens in class A versus class B versus class C. And all of that contributes to, you know, reexamining as we begin negotiations with our teachers, like what the contract is, what the requirements are, and what the costs are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1871.272s">[Graham]</a>: Relatedly, when you think about all the rest of the schools in the district, universally, our instructional time is at the minimum that the state allows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1882.358s">[Graham]</a>: So when we think about how much time we spend educating kids and what opportunities we're able to provide them, there's no wiggle room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1892.083s">[Graham]</a>: There's probably many, many reasons why we don't call a late<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1896.897s">[Graham]</a>: For those of you who are parents and you're like, why don't we do a 2 hour delay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1900.599s">[Graham]</a>: There's actually probably many reasons, but 1 of the reasons is because we don't have 2 hours to spare.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1907.043s">[Graham]</a>: So, we either have to bring the kids in for a whole day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1909.985s">[Graham]</a>: Or we're not meeting our instructional requirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1912.846s">[Graham]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1914.627s">[Graham]</a>: Looking at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1916.048s">[Graham]</a>: The, the nature and structure and lengths of the school day are all things that become possible when we are not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1924.115s">[Graham]</a>: Also, simultaneously talking about cutting staff, because if you think about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1929.215s">[Graham]</a>: How your elementary school student moves through their day, for example, they, they have their core classes and they have their specials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1936.678s">[Graham]</a>: That whole, like, the whole dynamic might need to shift in order to be able to spend another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1942.02s">[Graham]</a>: You know, 5 minutes a day on something like math and that then may require additional specialists to be able to support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1950.563s">[Graham]</a>: students in the building because every class changes so there's any number of ways that plays out in practice and we have to we obviously have to you know get with our partners in the union and sort of talk through all the nitty-gritty details of that but the way school day happens is going to change and in order for that to be possible it's very likely we're going to be asking teachers to do something different than they do today<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1978.94s">[Graham]</a>: And therefore, like, we need the sort of financial space to be able to have a productive conversation about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2548.717s">[Graham]</a>: Just quickly to say yes to around the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2552.379s">[Graham]</a>: We're several years away from that question being on the table for the voters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2560.805s">[Graham]</a>: The money that we are required to set aside for the early stages of that project have been set aside by the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2569.03s">[Graham]</a>: So in so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2571.812s">[Graham]</a>: When we talk about free cash, 1 of the things that happened back in June was an allocation of some of the free cash money, about 3M dollars to be ready for those early stages of so that is provided for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2584.615s">[Graham]</a>: But there's many steps that will go through before we get to a point of being being in a position to ask about that debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2593.457s">[Graham]</a>: 1 of the things that's very interesting, there's lots of documentation on the school building committee website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2599.061s">[Graham]</a>: If you want to know more about that project, all of the deliverables that we have submitted are out there with the exception of some of our.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2608.649s">[Graham]</a>: Some of our enrollment projection information, and I found that part of the exercise very enlightening because they did ask us to talk about future development and we talked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2618.396s">[Graham]</a>: You know, and we talked about in reference in partnership with the city, things like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2622.378s">[Graham]</a>: Projects in Medford square in project over the air rights in Wellington and some of the bigger sort of coming attractions and I will follow up with the communications director to make sure that those documents get out there because.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2636.586s">[Graham]</a>: I think where they landed is pretty digestible to the public and just to understand where that falls in relationship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2644.77s">[Graham]</a>: to some of these plans that we're talking about here from a development perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2648.571s">[Graham]</a>: They're real, they're coming, there's RFPs going out and all that good stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2651.912s">[Graham]</a>: But also, what effect and impact does that have on the size of the eventual Medford High School?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2673.786s">[Graham]</a>: Sure, we so we're in the very 1st stage of the project, which is called the eligibility phase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2681.577s">[Graham]</a>: Um, our, our eligibility phase started on May 1st and by July 10th, all of our deliverables were in, which usually takes about 6 months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2690.669s">[Graham]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2691.77s">[Graham]</a>: Um, we crushed through that in about 2 and a half months instead of 6. and so we are waiting now for, um, to finalize the process with MSBA, where we agree on how big of a population of students we're building a building for once that happens and they get back with us after they've done their work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2713.416s">[Graham]</a>: will move into the next phase, which is where we would hire the owner's project manager and ultimately the architect who will help conduct the feasibility study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2724.904s">[Graham]</a>: So that's where that feasibility study money comes in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2727.946s">[Graham]</a>: The feasibility study has to be completed in order to then have any sort of a spec that would be able to go out to debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2735.831s">[Graham]</a>: So it's not five to seven years away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2738.033s">[Graham]</a>: I hope that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2740.114s">[Graham]</a>: We have students in the building to 7 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2744.056s">[Graham]</a>: I certainly am pushing for that, but we're probably a couple years down the road before a debt exclusion before we're ready to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4130.64s">[Graham]</a>: If you have high school students, you know that this is desperately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4134.482s">[Graham]</a>: A long time coming, like I said earlier, my daughter is in the robotics and engineering program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4143.066s">[Graham]</a>: She takes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4144.947s">[Graham]</a>: There's no opportunity for her to take.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4147.768s">[Graham]</a>: An art class, which is the other sort of half of her brain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4150.429s">[Graham]</a>: So she struggles with that, but she takes Spanish online because there's no space in her schedule to take a language, which is a graduation requirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4158.512s">[Graham]</a>: And certainly, if you are thinking about pursuing a 4 year college experience after high school, they want to know that you have some sort of full language for some number of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4170.356s">[Graham]</a>: So, to answer the question, there is the changing the schedule is a huge undertaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4176.158s">[Graham]</a>: We are doing everything we can on the administrative side to be as ready as we can possibly be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4185.561s">[Graham]</a>: Before we are able to sort of have this productive conversation with with our teachers union.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4191.857s">[Graham]</a>: which hopefully can happen quickly once these questions are successful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4196.278s">[Graham]</a>: So there are some sort of like, I'll call them drop dead dates in the mix, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4201.58s">[Graham]</a>: So the high school students have to pick their schedule by like, say mid April, which would mean if you sort of back up from there, the offering and the new schedule would have to be ready in enough time to like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4219.426s">[Graham]</a>: Build everything so that students could pick their schedule in April.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4223.25s">[Graham]</a>: So we really are looking at a very tight window, but the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4230.699s">[Graham]</a>: Is working really hard to make this a reality for next school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4234.943s">[Graham]</a>: I.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4237.159s">[Graham]</a>: I think they think it's a huge amount of work and I think they are concerned about the viability of getting to that, that date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4244.286s">[Graham]</a>: What I have said is we can't wait another year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4247.269s">[Graham]</a>: Another class of kids can't wait for this to go another year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4252.854s">[Graham]</a>: So, I personally am really pushing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4256.877s">[Graham]</a>: that this override passes, obviously we will have the opportunity to invest some resource in making this a reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4264.002s">[Graham]</a>: And obviously we have to go through the negotiating process and we are talking about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4271.707s">[Graham]</a>: I'm sure the teachers union is talking about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4274.889s">[Graham]</a>: I want those conversations to be collaborative and productive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4279.452s">[Graham]</a>: And in saying that, that also means everybody's sort of ready and prepared for the discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4285.136s">[Graham]</a>: And so part of what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4287.137s">[Graham]</a>: I'm asking of the school administration is that they get ready and prepared about all the things that have to happen to make the schedule a reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4294.682s">[Graham]</a>: But I am very hopeful that if these pass, we will see maybe not like the final, final, final change by fall of next year, but hopefully pretty darn close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4307.69s">[Graham]</a>: Hopefully next year your students won't have to take a foreign language online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4314.178s">[Graham]</a>: But there's a lot of work there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4317.24s">[Graham]</a>: Everybody knows that there's a lot of work there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4319.481s">[Graham]</a>: And I think if you talk to anybody, any high school student, if you talk to parents of high school students, if you talk to teachers in the high school, like we've sort of all known this has to happen for any number of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4334.471s">[Graham]</a>: And the time is now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4337.373s">[Graham]</a>: So we're going to push on that as best we can to make that a reality for fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4353.926s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4508.035s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4509.576s">[Graham]</a>: Actually,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4511.053s">[Graham]</a>: with Paul's help, hopped in the time machine and went back through our school budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4519.159s">[Graham]</a>: And to see like, do we, you know, to answer the question, like, do we defund the schools ever?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4524.643s">[Graham]</a>: And the answer is basically no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4527.705s">[Graham]</a>: So there are years where we've flatlined the budget of the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4531.208s">[Graham]</a>: So like we did for fiscal year 2021.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4533.289s">[Graham]</a>: So we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4536.463s">[Graham]</a>: gave the schools the same exact appropriation for FY21 as they had for FY20.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4542.308s">[Graham]</a>: That is effectively a cut in order to make that work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4545.511s">[Graham]</a>: We laid off staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4547.212s">[Graham]</a>: So I would call that a flat line, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4549.194s">[Graham]</a>: Like it's effectively a cut, but the dollars from last year and the dollars from this year are the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4554.198s">[Graham]</a>: So we have done that, and we have not invested enough, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4560.061s">[Graham]</a>: In our school budget to grow the budget enough to sort of prevent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4566.449s">[Graham]</a>: But I had to go back to, like, the 80s to see a year where the number for this year was lower than the number for last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4576.04s">[Graham]</a>: And I think that was, like, in the middle of the financial crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4579.364s">[Graham]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4580.695s">[Graham]</a>: Medford certainly does have some history of flatlining the budget or for under investing, but we really don't have a history of defunding the school budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4592.339s">[Graham]</a>: So that is what would have to happen to, like, move this money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4596.74s">[Graham]</a>: We would have to be making choices to defund the school budget a year from now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4602.402s">[Graham]</a>: That is not why I do this work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4605.163s">[Graham]</a>: That is not why people pour their heart and their soul into helping lead our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4611.526s">[Graham]</a>: I'm a no on any proposal that defunds our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4616.588s">[Graham]</a>: I think the council, without exception, would also not agree to defund our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4622.551s">[Graham]</a>: So even if it were proposed,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4625.092s">[Graham]</a>: I don't think there's any support for that and I also don't think having worked with the council and the mayor on the finance task force that anybody even wants to entertain that idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4637.202s">[Graham]</a>: The entire premise of this is to do more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4639.604s">[Graham]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4641.906s">[Graham]</a>: just maybe rest assured that we don't have even a history of doing this sort of scary thing that is legally possible, but would require an inordinate amount of support to make it happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4654.458s">[Graham]</a>: And there is no support for that concept here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4890.751s">[Graham]</a>: Zach, the only thing I would say is the city put out earlier today a graphic about how we've used ARPA dollars, which I think has been a question that's out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4903.654s">[Graham]</a>: So check out the city's Facebook page or website to see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4909.515s">[Graham]</a>: We have a sort of a deeper dive into question 7 and 8 that are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4915.16s">[Graham]</a>: That is now done sort of almost hot off the presses and I think we can get that out in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4922.066s">[Graham]</a>: So be on the lookout for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4924.628s">[Graham]</a>: Where I'm happy to answer questions offline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4929.332s">[Graham]</a>: I know many of you please don't hesitate to reach out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4933.519s">[Graham]</a>: This is such a significant priority for me over the next couple of weeks, because it sets the stage for what the rest of this year becomes, and frankly, for what the future for our students becomes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4949.328s">[Graham]</a>: So it's a big deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4951.269s">[Graham]</a>: I'm happy to answer questions any time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4954.57s">[Graham]</a>: I will see maybe some of you at Walking Wednesday tomorrow at the Roberts, but grab me any time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4963.597s">[Graham]</a>: You have a question, happy to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5139.796s">[Graham]</a>: Thanks everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=30.857s">[Graham]</a>: Let me just one second to find the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=70.638s">[Graham]</a>: That was open apparently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=71.939s">[Graham]</a>: Here we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=82.805s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=145.452s">[Graham]</a>: I'm going to call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=147.412s">[Graham]</a>: Member Rousseau?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=149.032s">[Graham]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=150.753s">[Graham]</a>: Member Reinfeldt?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=151.873s">[Graham]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=153.253s">[Graham]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=153.953s">[Graham]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=154.333s">[Graham]</a>: So three present, zero absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=157.995s">[Graham]</a>: Our agenda today is really to kick off the strategic and capital planning process, particularly with a focus on the capital planning component, which is based on the policy that we passed unanimously last spring to lay out a series of steps for capital planning that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=177.944s">[Graham]</a>: line up and to the best of our ability, don't overlap budget season because that becomes too many things at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=187.27s">[Graham]</a>: So the goal here is for us to do this capital planning work in advance of the sort of operating budget conversation so that A, we can feed that both to the mayor and to the council in advance of budget season, but also so that we're not sort of stepping on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=207.045s">[Graham]</a>: The need for, you know, extra meetings and things like that, um, for all of our staff, uh, for that purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=213.25s">[Graham]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=213.49s">[Graham]</a>: Um, we have a meeting scheduled today and then we have a meeting scheduled in November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=217.894s">[Graham]</a>: Um, we may or may not need both meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=221.117s">[Graham]</a>: We'll sort of see how it goes today, but the goal for us is to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=226.894s">[Graham]</a>: take last year's capital plan and go through it together and make some updates to it to the best of our knowledge, as well as add potential capital projects to it that don't exist on there now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=244.76s">[Graham]</a>: And we'll talk a little bit about some of the work Peter has been doing to collect that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=249.721s">[Graham]</a>: And then really the other thing for us to do will be ultimately to come up with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=256.263s">[Graham]</a>: an attempt at prioritization of some kind for the whole giant list, um, so that we can clearly identify that for the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=265.287s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and then ultimately, um, to the mayor and the council and also, um, identify if there are projects that are potentially eligible for community preservation at, um, act funding, um, whether there's projects that are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=282.578s">[Graham]</a>: eligible to be included in that school spending, yes or no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=285.839s">[Graham]</a>: And then, you know, sort of all other and to start to have an ongoing process, which has been a little bit haphazard over the last couple of years, or really maybe forever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=298.744s">[Graham]</a>: But certainly, that it's been a thing that has been a work in progress for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=303.765s">[Graham]</a>: So really trying to get a more stringent process in place that aligns with that policy is sort of where we're at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=310.607s">[Graham]</a>: Does that make sense so far?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=316.844s">[Graham]</a>: I am going to pull up a copy of Our Last capital plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=330.031s">[Graham]</a>: One second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=379.292s">[Graham]</a>: This is where I will note my extreme dislike of Google Drive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=384.033s">[Graham]</a>: So give me just one more second and we'll find it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=392.596s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=393.176s">[Graham]</a>: I think I found it at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=394.837s">[Graham]</a>: OK, found it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=397.398s">[Graham]</a>: Sorry about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=399.638s">[Graham]</a>: I'm going to share my screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=403.665s">[Graham]</a>: Um, so the first thing I thought we would do is just refresh everyone's memory about what, um, the capital plan looks like as it existed last year when we met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=418.274s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and then we can talk a little bit about, um, where we are with some of these projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=424.638s">[Graham]</a>: Can you all see that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=436.65s">[Graham]</a>: better?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=442.956s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=446.86s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, so this is the capital plan as of the end of June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=451.865s">[Graham]</a>: We talked about all of these projects in our capital planning meeting and then this ultimately is also the capital plan that was submitted to MSBA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=460.874s">[Graham]</a>: Um, so it contained the projects, uh, that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=466.018s">[Graham]</a>: We knew about or we're planning for last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=468.82s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and so let's just sort of go from top to bottom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=472.804s">[Graham]</a>: So the first three projects are led light replacement projects, um, for Brooks, Missittuck and Medford high.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=480.289s">[Graham]</a>: Um, those are, um, at the time we said they were planned for FYI 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=489.11s">[Graham]</a>: And the way this works, my understanding is that it's on-bill financing through National Grid, and that we can, that these projects are in progress, and there's a, like, five-year payment cycle to do all of this work, because it contributes to energy savings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=510.136s">[Graham]</a>: So that's the first three here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=511.776s">[Graham]</a>: That's these first three rows right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=517.447s">[Graham]</a>: Um, some other projects that, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=522.168s">[Graham]</a>: Sort of shifting gears, we, we made sure we're on the plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=525.569s">[Graham]</a>: Um, we have this, um, solar roof and battery project at the Andrews, which is actually a city sponsored project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=536.732s">[Graham]</a>: And it has been in the works for quite some time, um, because it's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=542.934s">[Graham]</a>: being completed by the City of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=545.937s">[Graham]</a>: We don't have a whole lot of information about it and we might need to, perhaps at the next meeting, invite Alicia Hunt or others to join us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=555.367s">[Graham]</a>: But there were multiple parts of this project at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=560.272s">[Graham]</a>: There was putting solar on the roof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=562.694s">[Graham]</a>: putting solar batteries in place, and all of that was to help the Andrews Middle School become like an emergency shelter sort of resilience hub for the city, which lacks that now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=580.139s">[Graham]</a>: I don't have a tremendous amount of information about that, but that's what that one was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=583.059s">[Graham]</a>: Our HVAC replacement project is listed here as well for both McGlynn and Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=593.332s">[Graham]</a>: Um, we also then are sort of looking forward to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=599.355s">[Graham]</a>: Um, we will need to do roof rebuilds for McGlynn Elementary, Brooks, Missittuc and Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=607.138s">[Graham]</a>: So all of those schools are sort of at the stage where we need to begin watching, um, roof replacement needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=614.26s">[Graham]</a>: The Andrews has already been replaced as part of, um, that product, the solar roof and battery projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=619.942s">[Graham]</a>: So that updates to the roof had to be done before the solar, um, could even be viable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=625.444s">[Graham]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=629.888s">[Graham]</a>: As we talk about HVAC, we know that we will also have HVAC maintenance and replacement work to do at some point in the future around for Brooks, Missittuck, and Roberts because all of those systems are as old as the Andrews and McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=646.605s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and, uh, you know, we will, uh, be looking at that and I'll talk, I'll mention recommissioning in just a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=654.252s">[Graham]</a>: Um, we have, um, some district wide security upgrades on the next, um, on the next row here, uh, right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=664.08s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and then we do have, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=668.595s">[Graham]</a>: Playground renovations potentially at our other three middle schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=672.819s">[Graham]</a>: So I think everyone knows how amazing the work at the McGlynn was the good thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=681.126s">[Graham]</a>: You know, the good thing about that project is that it has really solved a whole host of issues at the McGlynn but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=691.155s">[Graham]</a>: The McGlynn space is so unique, there's very little that you could sort of envision lifting up and putting in place in some of our other school buildings because the other school buildings just simply don't have playgrounds sized like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=705.37s">[Graham]</a>: So there is some things to think about from a playground innovation perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=712.137s">[Graham]</a>: We also have on this list a front stairwell replacement project, ADA accessibility improvements and gutters for the Curtis Tufts building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=721.961s">[Graham]</a>: We have fire pump control work for McGlynn complex.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=728.584s">[Graham]</a>: We have the Brooks hot water heater.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=730.405s">[Graham]</a>: This actually update here has been approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=743.766s">[Graham]</a>: in September, I guess it was October, October 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=748.269s">[Graham]</a>: So that work is in progress now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=752.012s">[Graham]</a>: So that's good news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=755.094s">[Graham]</a>: We have also on this list, we have parking lot paving at the McGlynn and Andrews Complex.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=761.459s">[Graham]</a>: We have drainage at the field at the Brooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=764.861s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=792.869s">[Graham]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=795.535s">[Graham]</a>: And then we have a project to replace the field flashing behind the brick at the McGlynn Elementary that causes rain in the kindergarten classrooms when it is driving sideways rain apparently is the like factor there that sort of causes that problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=816.345s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and then we also have, uh, we also put on the list, um, the front Plaza, uh, settling at the McGlynn and the Andrews, um, and some, uh, potential remediation for ADA compliance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=831.038s">[Graham]</a>: Um, so that was everything on our list, um, as of June of last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=836.763s">[Graham]</a>: Any questions about that so far?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=849.911s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, so the next piece of this is to start to identify, are there other projects that need to be placed on this list that aren't here yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=863.102s">[Graham]</a>: And Dr. Cushing and I met a month or so ago and we talked about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=870.962s">[Graham]</a>: uh, efforts, um, which are consistent with the policy that we pass to make sure that our building leaders and all the buildings, um, participated in this process, um, by, uh, submitting any of their capital needs to us, um, via our new operations hero, um, ticketing system for maintenance and, um, custodial services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=895.021s">[Graham]</a>: So, um, Dr. Cushing put out a memo and a call to the team to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=902.047s">[Graham]</a>: collect input so that we could add to this list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=906.034s">[Graham]</a>: And I will ask him to tell us how that went and what he has to share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1026.616s">[Graham]</a>: It's the motor, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1133.982s">[Graham]</a>: So, Peter, is the request at all schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1141.564s">[Graham]</a>: And the grant is specific to the McLean MHS, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1144.525s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1144.725s">[Graham]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1144.945s">[Graham]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1145.365s">[Graham]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1196.702s">[Graham]</a>: Um, so we have $1.9 million as a cost estimate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1201.926s">[Graham]</a>: Is that does that include locks soup to nuts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1207.95s">[Graham]</a>: That includes everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1209.151s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1210.2s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1211.701s">[Graham]</a>: And the grant funding did not come through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1213.741s">[Graham]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1252.599s">[Graham]</a>: Yes, Member Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1314.813s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1319.477s">[Graham]</a>: So Peter, the new things that you, I just want to make sure that I got them as you were talking because that's first I was listening and then I was like, oh wait, I'm the note taker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1327.762s">[Graham]</a>: I should start writing some things down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1329.263s">[Graham]</a>: So I wanted to make sure I got them all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1332.045s">[Graham]</a>: So with the bike racks, the door sweeps, the freight elevator motor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1336.548s">[Graham]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1340.458s">[Graham]</a>: Did I miss anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1477.035s">[Graham]</a>: Dr. Cushing, when you said it's included in the HVAC project, do you mean just at McGlynn and Andrews?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1527.872s">[Graham]</a>: Sorry, I'm just going to make some notes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1530.074s">[Graham]</a>: Here we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1615.438s">[Graham]</a>: That's OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1617.439s">[Graham]</a>: So Peter, for that project, is the estimate still $20,000, or is it something different?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1680.356s">[Graham]</a>: So remember, Reinfeld, the other thing that is that is being actively bundled with the HVAC project is this recommissioning process that we've talked about a couple of times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1693.688s">[Graham]</a>: So that is something that is being bundled in with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1697.01s">[Graham]</a>: And what what recommissioning is going to tell us is how much light do we have left on the roof?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1704.457s">[Graham]</a>: how much life do we have left in the HVAC system and those kinds of things, as well as like smaller, easier things to address and fix.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1712.1s">[Graham]</a>: So the team was working on a proposal for that piece of the work around recommissioning for all of the buildings outside of McGlynn and Andrews, except for MHFs and Curtis Tufts, so Brooks, Missituck, Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1730.174s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and that would be included in that work and in that budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1733.677s">[Graham]</a>: I think from a city perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1736.919s">[Graham]</a>: The, I think the mayor and the council broadly know that the HVAC replacement is going to cost $20M.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1742.604s">[Graham]</a>: Um, the exact costs I think are still very much being refined and defined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1750.089s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and so the funding source of that in terms of how it'll be paid for, I think still is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1755.635s">[Graham]</a>: technically uncommitted because we're just not like ready to do that, to take that step just yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1763.58s">[Graham]</a>: And so I think the one question is like what really should be bundled in there when it comes to like the networked closets and the roof placements, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1775.268s">[Graham]</a>: So certainly if you're going to, I think that's a question for us and maybe a question to ask Alicia if we are able to have her join us next time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1785.655s">[Graham]</a>: Is really to think about if we're thinking about McGlynn and McGlynn complex and Andrews, um, we should be thinking about all of these parts as part of that bid, um, where the other schools, Brooks, Mr. Chuck Roberts may need to be in a subsequent planned round where, um, we do the recommissioning first and then it sort of leads us from a priority perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1815.523s">[Graham]</a>: Does that make sense?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1816.544s">[Graham]</a>: That makes perfect sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1818.205s">[Graham]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1819.746s">[Graham]</a>: So I'm just trying to Peter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1831.348s">[Graham]</a>: Peter, has the roof been officially deemed as part of the scope for the McGlynn, or not yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2197.972s">[Graham]</a>: On the topic of hot water heaters, do we have other hot water heaters that are in need of replacement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2205.931s">[Graham]</a>: So end of life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2207.332s">[Graham]</a>: I thought this was the last one to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2537.344s">[Graham]</a>: Members, so?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2640.583s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, let's do that another time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2642.224s">[Graham]</a>: Let's just worry about the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2655.436s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, so as you've been talking, what I've been trying to do is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2660.934s">[Graham]</a>: Um, let's create some buckets here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2662.935s">[Graham]</a>: Um, certainly the top bucket is the stuff that's in progress and and funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2667.737s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and so the HVAC project is up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2671.439s">[Graham]</a>: Uh, exactly how it's funded, how it will be funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2675.7s">[Graham]</a>: I don't think we know that yet, but we do know that it's on the radar and, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2681.923s">[Graham]</a>: You know, being planned for so that's everything up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2685.546s">[Graham]</a>: The Brooks hot water heater is I did move that up here as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2688.708s">[Graham]</a>: So that's this top piece of, like, here's what's in progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2692.551s">[Graham]</a>: And moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2695.965s">[Graham]</a>: down here is all the the rest of it i guess i would say i would call it and i grouped these three things um the roof rebuild the networked closet mini split replacements and the recommissioning assessment i put that on here as its own line item as the things that um are not committed yet but have been talked about as sort of part and parcel to that um that larger h back project so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2724.443s">[Graham]</a>: I will work with Peter and Alicia to determine between now and our next meeting, can those things move above the line and be bundled, or is there something else that has to happen for that to be effective, or does it have to come into the rest of the list?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2743.232s">[Graham]</a>: That is maybe a different grouping than this next group, which based on what we were talking about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2753.044s">[Graham]</a>: Sounded to me like the most urgent imminent things that we would be talking about prioritizing here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2763.234s">[Graham]</a>: And then the last grouping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2765.885s">[Graham]</a>: Is the things to plan for future many of which all of this stuff in particular is to be validated during recommissioning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2773.933s">[Graham]</a>: So not ready to do it yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2777.016s">[Graham]</a>: I did put district wide security upgrades down here for next year based on the feedback about the grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2785.121s">[Graham]</a>: The playground renovations are down here as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2788.582s">[Graham]</a>: They're on the radar parking lot, parking lot paving, and then the ADA plaza remediation, the settling remediation, and the district-wide electrification enablement assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2804.347s">[Graham]</a>: I guess the first question, member Rousseau, member Reinfeld, do any of the things on this bottom chunk belong in the middle as we should be doing this this year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2846.223s">[Graham]</a>: Well, Dr. Cushing, do you have a sense of the scope of this project?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2934.038s">[Graham]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2936.59s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, can we maybe take a to-do to talk to Paul Riggi about that to get a better assessment of what we might be looking at?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3031.486s">[Graham]</a>: Because the question is, can that be bundled or not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3036.427s">[Graham]</a>: So by the time we have our next meeting, I think we can answer that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3040.768s">[Graham]</a>: And I will invite Alicia as well to join us if she would like to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3046.489s">[Graham]</a>: But I will try to get the answer in the meantime anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3051.13s">[Graham]</a>: So maybe more to come on that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3083.631s">[Graham]</a>: Bye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3091.798s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3092.658s">[Graham]</a>: The other two items that were in this like near range situation were the door sweeps, Dr. Cushing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3101.926s">[Graham]</a>: And if you had any sense of what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3105.489s">[Graham]</a>: That number is and the other 1 is about the drainage at the Brooks field and I will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3117.051s">[Graham]</a>: I will mention that when that field was put in, we were promised that maintenance would happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3121.334s">[Graham]</a>: So I actually am going to be critical about that, that we were promised that that would happen, and it didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3128.879s">[Graham]</a>: We also were imminently promised that the drainage was going to be fixed, and it hasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3133.342s">[Graham]</a>: And my kids are in high school and eighth grade now, and they were in third grade at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3139.606s">[Graham]</a>: So we do have to get back to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3146.272s">[Graham]</a>: I'm just trying to look through my email because John may have sent me something about that, but Peter, I will let you answer as well about the door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3177.023s">[Graham]</a>: The issue at the Brooks is the hill and the water comes like it sort of runs down the hill and spills onto the field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3213.677s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3317.45s">[Graham]</a>: So that would be, I think, may be helpful for our next meeting as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3321.011s">[Graham]</a>: And then I was just looking in my email to see if I ever got<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3327.485s">[Graham]</a>: Uh, a quote from John about the drainage project, and I'm not seeing it, but I don't know, Peter, you have that or if we need to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3458.52s">[Graham]</a>: So I just separated that into two lines so that we have both of them on the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3469.643s">[Graham]</a>: Um, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3471.724s">[Graham]</a>: So I think this middle group is the group that we, a, we need to try to get some better pricing to understand where these projects are at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3480.927s">[Graham]</a>: And then B, um, we'll ultimately need to sort of prioritize and recommend, um, the go forward path on in the short term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3493.431s">[Graham]</a>: Does that sound right to you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3494.852s">[Graham]</a>: Is there anything else that's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3501.502s">[Graham]</a>: listed here that should move up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3586.306s">[Graham]</a>: I just put in maybe we can circle back and talk about that next time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3662.923s">[Graham]</a>: Well, there's four pillars that are eligible for CPC funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3669.306s">[Graham]</a>: One of them is affordable housing, so that broadly doesn't apply to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3673.556s">[Graham]</a>: Um, then there's like historic restoration, open space, and I'm forgetting the fourth tier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3683.726s">[Graham]</a>: I think it's recreation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3716.167s">[Graham]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3719.236s">[Graham]</a>: Um, so members, so I think this spreadsheet actually gets us to all of those places just in a different version.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3729.59s">[Graham]</a>: If we can add this net school spending.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3733.237s">[Graham]</a>: piece on and I think Noel that may be something that I can work with you on offline to tag these as whether or not they are sort of inclusive in that school spending or excluded from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3753.407s">[Graham]</a>: So we can do that before the next meeting as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3802.805s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, so I will share this with Noel after we're done here and ask that that be added to before our next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3821.874s">[Graham]</a>: Are there any other projects that you all have on your mind that haven't made this list just yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3903.178s">[Graham]</a>: I'll do dinner in a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3905.539s">[Graham]</a>: I think we can certainly update this once we hear from the afterschool program, if there's a capital need there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3912.821s">[Graham]</a>: Or it might just be building in grounds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3922.104s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3923.365s">[Graham]</a>: Hopefully not a capital need, but I hope not, but it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3929.366s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3931.287s">[Graham]</a>: So we can circle back to that at our next meeting as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3936.348s">[Graham]</a>: Is there anything else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3983.325s">[Graham]</a>: So I think maybe we can get some details about the like evolving scope of that project, which sounds like it's everything in the kitchen sink in that building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3991.728s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and then, um, we can, we can update it if necessary, but, um, I think the other, you know, the recommissioning process will also tell us whether that's an option for, um, the outside buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4049.623s">[Graham]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4100.003s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, and I think the other thing that is the consideration when we get to feasibility is do the administrative offices stay at the high school or do they get relocated and to a place like Curtis Tufts is always sort of something that is a possibility as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4121.62s">[Graham]</a>: Because the administrative offices, if I'm remembering correctly, generally are not reimbursable under MSBA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4127.505s">[Graham]</a>: So to rebuild the administrative offices, we would have to pay in totality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4132.19s">[Graham]</a>: So that may be a good way to change the use of that space instead of shutting it down completely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4142.739s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4151.064s">[Graham]</a>: Any other changes that people think we should make this evening?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4161.018s">[Graham]</a>: The agenda for our next meeting is exactly the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4165.4s">[Graham]</a>: It's to continue this conversation so that we can agree amongst this group what we're going to recommend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4175.484s">[Graham]</a>: And then that will go to a committee of the whole in December, where we will walk through what this is and what is on here and formalize a recommendation from the school committee that will be shared with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4189.13s">[Graham]</a>: The mayor and obviously may will be there, but the mayor and the council in terms of funding needs and so that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4198.894s">[Graham]</a>: At a capital level, we can plan accordingly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4203.515s">[Graham]</a>: So, I think we can make a motion to continue this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4207.037s">[Graham]</a>: Is that right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4213.919s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4217.779s">[Graham]</a>: Is there a motion to continue the meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4229.482s">[Graham]</a>: It's the 19th of November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4231.502s">[Graham]</a>: The 19th of November, correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4237.904s">[Graham]</a>: Five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4241.225s">[Graham]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4243.045s">[Graham]</a>: Wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4244.105s">[Graham]</a>: There's a motion on the floor to continue the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4247.156s">[Graham]</a>: I'll second that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4248.736s">[Graham]</a>: Second by Member Reinfeldt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4251.677s">[Graham]</a>: I will take a roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4252.798s">[Graham]</a>: So Member Roussel?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4254.498s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4255.658s">[Graham]</a>: Member Reinfeldt?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4256.959s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4257.779s">[Graham]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4258.359s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4259.46s">[Graham]</a>: Three in the affirmative, zero in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4262.24s">[Graham]</a>: The meeting is continued until November 19th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4270.623s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=10.469s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=10.809s">[Graham]</a>: A couple of quick notes for everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=15.313s">[Graham]</a>: We had our first strategic capital planning meeting around this capital plan specifically last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=23.819s">[Graham]</a>: We have another meeting scheduled for November 19th to finish the draft of the capital plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=31.545s">[Graham]</a>: And after that in December, we will have a committee of the whole scheduled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=36.449s">[Graham]</a>: All of those meetings are Zoom only.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=38.89s">[Graham]</a>: And we in December will have a capital plan for this group to work through, ask questions about and prioritize so that we can give direction to the district about any CPC funding we want to direct the district to apply for to the mayor and the council about the immediate capital needs and the upcoming capital needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=62.144s">[Graham]</a>: etcetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=62.644s">[Graham]</a>: So, there we had a good productive discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=65.507s">[Graham]</a>: It started with the input of the building principles across the district to identify some of those projects that were maybe not otherwise listed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=75.936s">[Graham]</a>: So, we've updated the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=77.577s">[Graham]</a>: There are a number of capital projects in process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=79.859s">[Graham]</a>: So, those those are noted as well and there's a huge number of upcoming capital needs, not the least of which is the HVAC<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=88.146s">[Graham]</a>: project at McGlynn and Andrews, but all of that is being sort of packaged up as part of the policy that we passed last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=94.911s">[Graham]</a>: And we will be ready to share in a committee of the whole in December.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=100.676s">[Graham]</a>: So right on schedule with our with our timeline so that that does not interfere with our typical budgeting process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=108.361s">[Graham]</a>: Whether that interferes with other supplemental appropriation budgets is sort of a one-time thing for us to consider maybe this year, but generally speaking, I think we're on a good track to not overlap the budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=120.732s">[Graham]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=122.694s">[Graham]</a>: Member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1866.803s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1868.384s">[Graham]</a>: I don't know if this is a question for the folks on Zoom, but I was curious how many filling stations we would be eligible for in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1878.527s">[Graham]</a>: Is it per number of students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1881.148s">[Graham]</a>: Is it based on square footage?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1883.409s">[Graham]</a>: How do you decide how many we would be eligible for under the grant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1935.95s">[Graham]</a>: Wow, that's fabulous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1937.711s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1938.091s">[Graham]</a>: And I think the other question that I had was, are the results that we saw here unusual in any way?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1947.233s">[Graham]</a>: Like my first thought was like, how do we have all this like lead in our fixtures?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1952.035s">[Graham]</a>: And I just didn't know if this was unusual in some way for us or if this is pretty common based on what you see in other districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2004.508s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2005.108s">[Graham]</a>: That is just helpful context to understand because our buildings were not generally built before 1986.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2011.25s">[Graham]</a>: So is the typical remediation, I know it's different for everybody, but is the typical remediation at that point, simply replace, I'll say simply, but simply replacing the fixtures, or are there other potential things that need to happen in terms of our planning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2066.009s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2066.47s">[Graham]</a>: And I will just note to the committee that we will put this faucet replacement remediation on the capital plan as well, just so we don't lose track of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3688.353s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3689.013s">[Graham]</a>: Hi, I'm Jenny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3690.354s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3691.375s">[Graham]</a>: A couple of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3693.657s">[Graham]</a>: How, when you think about the people that are in the pipeline to be tested, how many of them are coming to Medford and do you have any timeline at all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3798.025s">[Graham]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3800.618s">[Graham]</a>: A couple of other things I think just strategically, there's a lot of conversation in Medford about the huge thousand kids who are not eligible for transportation to the middle and the high schools because they live between one and two miles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3814.962s">[Graham]</a>: And your bus drivers can probably tell you that traffic around Medford is a nightmare.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3819.803s">[Graham]</a>: I am shocked that anybody gets to school on time at Medford High because I live a few blocks away and it's like impassable to get through there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3830.186s">[Graham]</a>: even until almost eight o'clock and school starts at like 740 or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3833.668s">[Graham]</a>: So I think the other thing that we're talking about is all of those people who are driving their kids to school, that's a hardship for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3844.674s">[Graham]</a>: It's bad for our roads and it would be far more efficient to put those kids on a bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3850.097s">[Graham]</a>: We obviously don't have the money to do that right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3853.56s">[Graham]</a>: But if that is to change like we I think we could be in a position that when we go out to bid we would be looking for additional buses and I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3865.905s">[Graham]</a>: I would be interested to know from you all how we can help the bus driver shortage situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3872.25s">[Graham]</a>: I'm not sure there's much we can do, but if there is something we can do, please let us know because it's really important that kids get to school on time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3880.555s">[Graham]</a>: And if the bus is late, that's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3883.257s">[Graham]</a>: If their parents can't drive them and they're walking two miles, that's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3887.901s">[Graham]</a>: So I wanna make sure that we're doing what we can to support<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3891.863s">[Graham]</a>: you all as you think about getting additional drivers here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3895.764s">[Graham]</a>: The other comment I did have about the afterschool programs in the afternoons, I appreciate the willingness to send the buses when they are available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3908.969s">[Graham]</a>: I think that is a huge help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3911.97s">[Graham]</a>: And the folks whose kids are sitting and waiting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3916.391s">[Graham]</a>: for a really long time are really appreciative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3918.552s">[Graham]</a>: They obviously want that to already have happened and be done yesterday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3923.514s">[Graham]</a>: But I was talking to some parents recently, and they were talking about how their kid spends an hour on the bus from the Roberts to the square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3932.459s">[Graham]</a>: And you all made some sort of route adjustment recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3935.52s">[Graham]</a>: And the parent sought me out to tell me that the change was dramatic for their kids getting off at their after-school program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3943.644s">[Graham]</a>: And it was the difference but it was like a 40 minute 45 minute difference so thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3950.091s">[Graham]</a>: And I am, I am interested in where else our roots can be optimized like that so that kids are not sitting on the bus because the truth is they're sitting in the elementary schools for some amount of time before they even get on the bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3964.426s">[Graham]</a>: for kids to not be getting to an after school program till like after 4pm 430.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3970.932s">[Graham]</a>: It's a very, very long time to wait and parents are paying for those services that they're not getting so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3977.153s">[Graham]</a>: If there are other route optimizations that can happen, I assume you use some sort of geo software that helps map the routes, but we would certainly be interested in anything you can do to support route optimization to get kids to their destination just a little bit faster.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4103.362s">[Graham]</a>: And then my last question, we have had multiple incidents where students have been let off the bus in the wrong place this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4112.246s">[Graham]</a>: And I fielded a call from a parent who was pretty distraught about that on a recent Friday evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4120.689s">[Graham]</a>: And so I'm just curious from your standpoint, like, is there something we're doing in Medford that is exacerbating<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4127.412s">[Graham]</a>: This situation where five year olds get off the bus and cross the square by themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4131.935s">[Graham]</a>: Is there something we could be doing differently to assist your drivers like what how do we make sure five year olds are not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4138.513s">[Graham]</a>: traversing the square by themselves because they got off at the wrong stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4216.864s">[Graham]</a>: And so what can we do in Medford to make this easier on your drivers because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4224.918s">[Graham]</a>: I feel for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4227.499s">[Graham]</a>: I thought 63 was the number, so I'm a little blown away that it's 77.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4231.581s">[Graham]</a>: But obviously, it's a really hard job for them to keep control of the bus, to keep all the things from going right on the bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4240.284s">[Graham]</a>: And I'm just curious from your standpoint, what should we be doing that would help the situation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4269.564s">[Graham]</a>: Does Cambridge pay for those monitors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4309.943s">[Graham]</a>: They're all going to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4311.024s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4380.64s">[Graham]</a>: appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4382.401s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4383.442s">[Graham]</a>: So I think my request to the superintendent is that the principals be asked to make sure that kids are all tagged, that there is some sort of protocol for what happens when a new student gets on the bus so that we're in communication with the bus driver as as that's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4401.479s">[Graham]</a>: feel like I've seen that happen before when I've been in sort of bus area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4407.321s">[Graham]</a>: But just to make sure that it is happening with some consistency, I think would be very helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4413.003s">[Graham]</a>: And to try to lighten the load from a bus driver perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4418.765s">[Graham]</a>: And then your point about bus monitors, we've been asked that question many times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4423.986s">[Graham]</a>: Obviously, it's a very expensive endeavor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4427.117s">[Graham]</a>: and perhaps there's some relief coming on that too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4430.999s">[Graham]</a>: So stay tuned for more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4434.221s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you very much for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=222.433s">[Graham]</a>: Can you all hear me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=224.654s">[Graham]</a>: Hi everyone, my name is Jenny Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=226.315s">[Graham]</a>: I think I know many or most of you from five years as a school committee member, most recently I've been vice chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=234.137s">[Graham]</a>: I'm also the chair of the Medford Comprehensive High School Building Committee for the Princeton household, commonly referred to as FSEA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=242.521s">[Graham]</a>: FSEA is a statewide authority that helps communities like ours build new high schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=249.003s">[Graham]</a>: So we're not here to talk about anything for high school, but I do want to mention that that is another hat that I wear, so if you have questions about that, I'm happy to answer them after that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=258.529s">[Graham]</a>: I'm excited that we're here because I'm excited that we all get to participate in this vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=265.453s">[Graham]</a>: So this is the first time in Medgar we've ever let everybody have a choice and a voice in how our students forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=273.478s">[Graham]</a>: And we have some really big questions on the ballot this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=276.74s">[Graham]</a>: In my opinion, we should have done this sooner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=279.501s">[Graham]</a>: We can debate the merits of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=281.582s">[Graham]</a>: Again, at another time, maybe over coffee or a cocktail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=285.863s">[Graham]</a>: But here we are and we have some choices to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=288.764s">[Graham]</a>: If you're following the school budget over the course of the last year, you know that we faced some very difficult decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=297.107s">[Graham]</a>: That's a nice way to say we laid off human beings who work in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=302.109s">[Graham]</a>: So trust me when I tell you nobody wants to do that, no matter what side of the aisle you're on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=308.951s">[Graham]</a>: There's really a disagreement that we need more and not fewer mental health supporters in our schools, that our teachers do without, that our buildings are in disrepair, and that we have no current cut forward to fund our technology replacement program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=325.656s">[Graham]</a>: So, those are real facts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=328.437s">[Graham]</a>: They were very present when we negotiated the budget last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=333.32s">[Graham]</a>: The initial budget was much worse than where it landed, and we only landed in a slightly less bad place because we used one-time funds, also known as free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=346.005s">[Graham]</a>: to temporarily fill the gap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=349.067s">[Graham]</a>: That's not a funding strategy for operating costs on a going forward basis or really for any sustainable content at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=355.949s">[Graham]</a>: I know that, I'm a finance major, I have a degree from Babson College, I run a business, I absolutely understand what it takes to make good decisions about these kinds of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=366.614s">[Graham]</a>: And sometimes you have to do the things in the short term that give you the bridge to the long term and that's what we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=371.796s">[Graham]</a>: So here we are, we're at sort of the other side of that bridge, and we're ready to make a plan for the long term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=378.641s">[Graham]</a>: I am hopeful that the energy in this community is going to say yes, we want to invest in Medford, we want to invest in kids, we want to invest in our fire department, we want to invest in our roads, and we will have a completely different conversation next time than really we've had for the last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=394.331s">[Graham]</a>: budget cycles that I've been here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=395.992s">[Graham]</a>: It's always just been some version of bad because there simply is not enough money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=401.496s">[Graham]</a>: And I am ready to have a different conversation where we can talk about doing more for our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=406.7s">[Graham]</a>: So I'll leave it there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=407.94s">[Graham]</a>: I'm going to pass it to Naomi Kern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=410.222s">[Graham]</a>: And we are excited to be here with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=412.323s">[Graham]</a>: We're happy to answer your questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=414.965s">[Graham]</a>: And that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1568.602s">[Graham]</a>: The only other thing I'll say about free cash from my perspective, that money is the bucket of money that we can use to do capital projects at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1579.834s">[Graham]</a>: So if there's nothing left at the end of the year, there are no opportunities for capital projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1586.04s">[Graham]</a>: The school budget is not resourced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1588.863s">[Graham]</a>: to do big capital projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1591.005s">[Graham]</a>: We rely on the city to be able to grant those one-time funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1594.847s">[Graham]</a>: That's a very typical process in communities across the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1599.69s">[Graham]</a>: Cities usually do sort of pick up the cost of those school-based projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1606.745s">[Graham]</a>: The school committee has re-launched a different and more rigorous capital planning process this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1615.371s">[Graham]</a>: We held our first meeting last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1617.233s">[Graham]</a>: Part of the reason we did that is I see some folks in the room who were part of building these new schools, and since then we really haven't done the right thing to maintain them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1627.441s">[Graham]</a>: And why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1627.961s">[Graham]</a>: Money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1630.043s">[Graham]</a>: It costs money to do maintenance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1631.964s">[Graham]</a>: So there's a couple of ways we have to fix that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1634.866s">[Graham]</a>: One is, we have to start doing that maintenance, which means the operating budget of the schools has to increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1640.37s">[Graham]</a>: That's not free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1641.631s">[Graham]</a>: But the other is, we have realities like a broken water heater at the Brooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1646.734s">[Graham]</a>: They have to prepare food for children at the Brooks, and they need to be able to sanitize their equipment, and they don't have a hot water heater.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1654.219s">[Graham]</a>: So they are, our staff are amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1656.801s">[Graham]</a>: They do everything that they can to work on all this stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1659.683s">[Graham]</a>: But the fact of the matter is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1661.994s">[Graham]</a>: All of the ways we could have done maintenance to this point and didn't, that leads us to capital needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1668.797s">[Graham]</a>: And so we have to get out of this cycle of waiting until something, there's a hole in the roof, a roof falls in, a hot water heater is broken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1677.782s">[Graham]</a>: We should be able to do a better job with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1680.894s">[Graham]</a>: And we can say that we should have done a better job for the last however long the schools have been built, 20 years, 25 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1687.762s">[Graham]</a>: I agree with all of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1689.003s">[Graham]</a>: But here we are, and we have choices to make about how we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1693.228s">[Graham]</a>: And for me, I want to move forward in a productive way that addresses the backlog and sets us up on a path to go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1700.576s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2294.41s">[Graham]</a>: Jen, would you like to start?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2298.034s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2300.436s">[Graham]</a>: We put out an explainer, there's some copies of it in the back, it's, we call it a one-pager because it's intended to be printed from the back, but maybe it's a two-pager to some.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2311.263s">[Graham]</a>: That document was our, my attempt with Member Reinfeldt, who I think is here somewhere, I think she's in the back, to be responsive to people saying, well, what is this for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2324.651s">[Graham]</a>: And the sneaky part is that when you're talking about the school budget,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2328.914s">[Graham]</a>: 80-85% of the school budget is subject to collective bargaining agreements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2333.422s">[Graham]</a>: So that means 80-85% of our costs are about personnel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2339.231s">[Graham]</a>: It's not uncommon, we're not unusual in any way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2342.737s">[Graham]</a>: But the truth of the matter is, we can't decide how much we're going to pay anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2349.658s">[Graham]</a>: That happens at a bargaining table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2351.819s">[Graham]</a>: And in order to put information out, we would have to be doing that in collaboration with people at the bargaining table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2359.2s">[Graham]</a>: Having those kinds of conversations when there is actually no money to spend is exceedingly difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2367.648s">[Graham]</a>: So what we did instead was try to give you an understanding based on numbers we could share, like how much those salaries cost in this past year that we used one-time funds to fund, how many positions we saved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2381.734s">[Graham]</a>: So we really tried in question seven on that explainer to tell you a little bit about what we're preserving when that question is successful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2391.258s">[Graham]</a>: For question eight,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2392.97s">[Graham]</a>: What we tried to do, this one gets a little bit harder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2397.793s">[Graham]</a>: Because what we start to talk about is what could we do in the future?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2402.055s">[Graham]</a>: And again, we're back at the bargaining table to talk about things like living wages for our paraprofessionals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2409.238s">[Graham]</a>: We've done a lot of work to improve the pay scales for our paraprofessionals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2414.861s">[Graham]</a>: They used to barely make a minimum wage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2417.502s">[Graham]</a>: Now they make more than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2420.304s">[Graham]</a>: But they come to the table and tell us that they deserve more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2425.393s">[Graham]</a>: We agree, but there is no more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2427.435s">[Graham]</a>: So, what we tried to do in that explainer, take a look, have the answer questions afterwards, is give you some details about what we might do with the knowledge that it will all be spent on schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2439.823s">[Graham]</a>: The school committee, through its statutory process around budgets, will hold hearings and pass a budget in the open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2447.969s">[Graham]</a>: So, we're here to pass a budget in the open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2450.331s">[Graham]</a>: That's what we're going to do when this is successful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2454.392s">[Graham]</a>: Or we will cut the budget in the open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2456.294s">[Graham]</a>: That's the alternative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2457.174s">[Graham]</a>: So what seven does is help us not keep cutting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2461.517s">[Graham]</a>: What eight does is allow us to have a different conversation about the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2465.619s">[Graham]</a>: That is not about doing less and less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2621.615s">[Graham]</a>: So I actually went digging and Bedford has a history of flatlining budgets for the schools or giving an increase that's not enough to cover contractual increases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2635.065s">[Graham]</a>: That is true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2635.766s">[Graham]</a>: That has happened in Bedford for many, many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2638.908s">[Graham]</a>: The only time I could find an instance where we actually<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2643.51s">[Graham]</a>: reduced the school budget was like back in the 80s.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2646.576s">[Graham]</a>: So we really don't have a history of cutting the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2650.482s">[Graham]</a>: We have some history, unfortunately, of flatlining the budget, and we have some history of underfunding the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2656.923s">[Graham]</a>: So there's really no history of us cutting the budget on the school side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2661.227s">[Graham]</a>: Other departments, I think for sure, have had different experiences with that, but when we talk about could we cut the budget, if we did, we would be handing out pay slips.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2672.256s">[Graham]</a>: We would be talking about the positions that we're eliminating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2676.98s">[Graham]</a>: And that's not what anybody wants to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2679.922s">[Graham]</a>: It's not my priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2682.364s">[Graham]</a>: There needs to be more help for our students, not less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2686.367s">[Graham]</a>: So that fear, I understand it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2689.768s">[Graham]</a>: When you don't get to personally hand out the dollars, I understand that there's always a feeling that someone might not do it the way that you do, but that's why we have a committee of seven people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2700.532s">[Graham]</a>: The mayor doesn't get to decide this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2702.572s">[Graham]</a>: I don't get to decide this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2704.433s">[Graham]</a>: It requires the majority vote of the school committee to spend every single penny that is spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3063.578s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3065.26s">[Graham]</a>: So to the questions that are in the community about the finance task force, that's exactly what we did each time we met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3073.089s">[Graham]</a>: We had one question to answer, which was, what is our go forward plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3078.396s">[Graham]</a>: We talked in a lot of detail about what that could be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3082.159s">[Graham]</a>: We talked a lot about plans for the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3084.361s">[Graham]</a>: We talked about the high school coming online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3086.403s">[Graham]</a>: We talked about is this the start of a series of overrides or is it the end?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3091.968s">[Graham]</a>: You know, is it a one-time shot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3093.649s">[Graham]</a>: And we sort of landed<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3095.031s">[Graham]</a>: I guess I would say somewhere in the middle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3096.532s">[Graham]</a>: So we do not want to be putting questions before you like some communities do every single year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3103.535s">[Graham]</a>: We're new at this in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3104.876s">[Graham]</a>: We have no community muscle around how to do it, how to have productive conversations that are respectful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3110.798s">[Graham]</a>: We're all learning through that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3112.439s">[Graham]</a>: So you're all here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3113.74s">[Graham]</a>: You're not all in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3114.84s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3117.021s">[Graham]</a>: And what we landed on was a number that was big enough to make a difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3121.824s">[Graham]</a>: smaller than what the real need is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3124.105s">[Graham]</a>: And what does that mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3125.265s">[Graham]</a>: That means we have, again, created a bridge to a place where development can help start to carry some more of the load than it historically has been able to do in that regard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3137.767s">[Graham]</a>: The final comment was about the school committee raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3140.448s">[Graham]</a>: I just want to correct the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3142.148s">[Graham]</a>: We did not receive a 143% raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3146.649s">[Graham]</a>: we received a $5,000 raise for the first time for the position in 24 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3153.151s">[Graham]</a>: I could tell you and we can talk afterwards about all the work that the school committee does, it is equivalent to the work of the council and I continue to believe that we should be paid the same as the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3165.613s">[Graham]</a>: But 5,000 is not 143% of $12,000, so that's that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3168.594s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3356.794s">[Graham]</a>: On the school side, I would point you to the detailed graphic that actually does talk about the positions we saved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3364.117s">[Graham]</a>: Those would be the first positions that would be cut in another sort of down budget cycle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3371.601s">[Graham]</a>: So if these are not successful, those positions are gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3376.823s">[Graham]</a>: July 1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3377.683s">[Graham]</a>: So we will say goodbye to humans who work in our school district again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3380.584s">[Graham]</a>: I don't want to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3382.345s">[Graham]</a>: I don't want us to keep all of those folks because they're really important to our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3386.966s">[Graham]</a>: And more importantly, I want to have the ability to address some of the structural issues that we have in our schools around totally incompatible high school schedules, the minimum number of hours that the state allows us, not enough transportation, all of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3404.324s">[Graham]</a>: can't even meet conversations if question 8 does not pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3408.229s">[Graham]</a>: If they pass, we can have a conversation and we will have to decide what our priorities are because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3414.841s">[Graham]</a>: There's $4 million is not the full enchilada in terms of fully funding everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3419.923s">[Graham]</a>: We're still very far away from a free public school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3423.945s">[Graham]</a>: We can debate the merits of free public school systems and things like free lunch at another time, but this amount of money does not put us even in the legal territory of giving away a free education, which probably I think we should do, but that's not what this does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3440.951s">[Graham]</a>: This helps us move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3797.866s">[Graham]</a>: January 25th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3798.626s">[Graham]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3800.327s">[Graham]</a>: Except question six, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3802.509s">[Graham]</a>: The debt exclusion is not until there's an actual bond to be issued.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4631.917s">[Graham]</a>: Our overall school enrollment hasn't changed that much in the last handful of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4637.438s">[Graham]</a>: What we are experiencing is record numbers of kindergartners coming into our schools every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4645.3s">[Graham]</a>: So if you use what they call a survival analysis that says how does that kindergartner become a first grader and a second grader and a third grader, the numbers climb over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4657.967s">[Graham]</a>: But what we do know is that two of our school buildings are absolutely busting at the seams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4664.734s">[Graham]</a>: The Roberts and the Brooks are busting at the seams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4667.677s">[Graham]</a>: There's not any more space in those buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4670.78s">[Graham]</a>: So if we have another record kindergarten here next year, we're going to have an issue in those two buildings in particular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4677.467s">[Graham]</a>: That's not the case in all four of our elementary school buildings and so there's some<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4681.84s">[Graham]</a>: potentially expensive redistricting that we may have to do pretty urgently to deal with the realities of how the population is changing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4692.525s">[Graham]</a>: We also, looking forward, are looking at our population in our school system changing as we invest in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4702.989s">[Graham]</a>: We expect more parents to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4709.284s">[Graham]</a>: increase the number of students, both at the middle school and the high school is our prediction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4800.43s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, I'll take a shot at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4801.831s">[Graham]</a>: How did we get here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4804.112s">[Graham]</a>: We have been constrained by Prop 2.5 since 1980.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4806.933s">[Graham]</a>: That's how we got here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4808.073s">[Graham]</a>: Inflation is more than 2.5% every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4811.895s">[Graham]</a>: You can see, actually we should pass this chart around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4814.936s">[Graham]</a>: You can see that Medford's new growth has been marginal since that same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4819.939s">[Graham]</a>: So the two levers we have are taxation and new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4823.78s">[Graham]</a>: And we haven't done any more taxation than 2.5%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4828.092s">[Graham]</a>: and our new growth has been very minor in nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4833.273s">[Graham]</a>: Meanwhile, all of our costs are exploding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4835.393s">[Graham]</a>: Our healthcare, our pensions, all of those things go up in double digits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4840.214s">[Graham]</a>: So we're sort of at a squeeze point and we have decisions that we have to make as a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4845.335s">[Graham]</a>: Why we didn't do it sooner, it takes a tremendous amount of will for elected officials to allow the city to vote in a representative way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4858.413s">[Graham]</a>: When you're an elected official, you have what many people think is tons of power.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4862.658s">[Graham]</a>: I don't personally feel that way, but lots of people do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4866.242s">[Graham]</a>: And you have a lot of decisions to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4868.484s">[Graham]</a>: And so there's two ways you can make decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4870.286s">[Graham]</a>: One is you can make decisions, and the other is you can ask the community to help you make the decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4875.332s">[Graham]</a>: So this is us saying to you,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4877.472s">[Graham]</a>: we're asking you to help us make this decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4880.253s">[Graham]</a>: So there is no more direct democracy than a ballot question in a presidential election year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4886.154s">[Graham]</a>: We are expecting wonderful turnout, there's a lot of energy, and we're super excited to see what this community really thinks of us.<br><br>
